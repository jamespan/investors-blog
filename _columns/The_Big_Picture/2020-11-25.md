Stock Market Ends Mixed, But Nasdaq Hits All-Time High; Snowflake Breaks Out Ahead Of Earnings
===============================================================================================

It was an uneventful session for the stock market Wednesday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but the Nasdaq composite found another gear and scored an all-time high.




The confirmed market uptrend is still intact for the major stock indexes, although the environment has gotten a bit more challenging for growth investors. And the latest Investors Intelligence survey of stock market newsletter writers wasn't exactly good news for the bulls.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.6% after topping the 30,000 level Tuesday. It closed at 29,872. **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was a drag on the Dow Jones after the Wall Street Journal reported the company has been talking with **Slack** ([WORK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WORK)) about possibly acquiring it. Slack soared nearly 38% on the news.


Salesforce stock slumped more than 5% in higher volume. It closed below the 50-day moving average ahead of next week's earnings report. Volatile price swings lately — and Wednesday's outside day — weaken the stock's technical picture.

The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5% to an all-time high, helped by strength in software stocks. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) rallied 1.1%.


The S&P 500 eased 0.2% and the Russell 2000 small-cap index slipped 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq fell sharply from Tuesday's unusually heavy levels.


Advancing stocks were about even with decliners on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, decliners outnumbered risers by about 3-to-2.


Stock Market Earnings
---------------------


Salesforce is among a group of enterprise software stocks with earnings due next week. Other reports to watch include **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) and **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)). In the security software group, results are also due from **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)), **Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)).


Snowflake rose for the eighth straight session Wednesday and topped a 301.10 buy point. Results are due Dec. 2 after the close. The company isn't profitable yet but shows triple-digit sales growth in recent quarters.


CrowdStrike, meanwhile is near the top of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 154 entry. Group peer Zscaler is forming a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) with a 158.84 entry.


Bullish Sentiment Soars
-----------------------


In other stock market news, the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a big jump in bullish sentiment, to 64.6% from 59.6% the prior week. It's a contrarian indicator because the crowd is often wrong at market tops and bottoms. The bulls hit 61.5% in early September just ahead of a market pullback.


Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index is back near its August lows. So is the put-call volume ratio, which came in at 0.54 Wednesday. It's been heading lower after hitting 0.77 on Nov. 11. Both indicators point toward a complacent market.



Lofty bullish sentiment and a complacent market aren't the only yellow flags at this point. Another one is frothy action in some of the market's more speculative names. **Blink Charging** ([BLNK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLNK)) is a good example. Shares soared more than 100% last week alone.


IPOs On The Move
----------------


Meanwhile, other recent IPOs continued their fast rise Wednesday, including **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)), which jumped 22%. The Palantir position was trimmed on [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Tuesday when the gain from the 11.52 buy point hit 100%. Palantir closed Wednesday 50% above its 10-day moving average, raising the likelihood of a pullback sooner rather than later. Palantir joined Leaderboard on Nov. 5.

Hearing-aid maker **Eargo** ([EAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EAR)) soared to a new high, rising 10% to 45.95. It cleared an IPO base with a 43.90 buy point. After Wednesday's gain, its average daily dollar volume is a respectable $25 million.


After eight straight gains, sellers finally came into recent IPO **Corsair Gaming** ([CRSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSR)). Shares slumped 16.5%. Headed into Wednesday, it was 43% above its 10-day moving average.


Yellow flags are out there, but the stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend. That means it still makes sense to look for top-rated growth stocks setting up in bases or testing key support levels.


Don't stay married to former leaders like Zoom Video and **Peloton** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)). Instead, target stocks with relative strength lines at or near new high ground. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500.



**Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) are breakout candidates.


Start slowly with new purchases and see how they perform. If you have been buying stocks lately and not making a lot of headway, listen to the market's message and take your foot off the accelerator. Let the market come to you and avoid the pitfall of chasing extended stocks.

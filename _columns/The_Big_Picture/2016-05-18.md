Stock indexes on Wednesday once again revealed their fear of letting go of low interest rates.


The Nasdaq was forced to settle for a 0.5% gain after being up as much as 1%, thanks to the Fed. The S&P 500 finished flat, and the IBD 50 inched down 0.1%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq but crept higher on the NYSE.

The minutes revealed a Fed that was ready to raise rates in June, if the economy continues to improve. Stocks tumbled as the news came out.


The truth underlying the situation: The Fed wants to return to a more normal financial environment. For individual investors, though, a question lingers: Can the stock market handle the truth?


The answer in December was a clear no.


After the Dec. 16 rate hike, the Nasdaq traded erratically around its 50-day line for almost two weeks and then went into an 18% swoon that lasted about two months.


Yet at some point, the market will begin to see normalization as not only inevitable but good. Is the market there yet? Wednesday’s action alone wasn’t enough to answer the question. But the Nasdaq’s bounce off the day’s lows was encouraging.


What should individual investors do in the meantime?


They might consider building a watch list with stocks that are likely to win if the path to normalization continues.


On Wednesday, banks and financials were the place to be. Among IBD’s 197 industry groups, banks and financial companies locked in nine of the top 20 spots for best performers for the day.


Banks could benefit from higher rates because higher rates generally bring better net interest margins.


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) was among the day's winners. The stock thrust 4% in fast trade as it retook its 200-day line. JPMorgan is nearing a 64.76 handle buy point. The fundamentals, though, are in need of repair. The EPS Rating is 58, which means about 4 of every 10 stocks is growing earnings at a faster rate.


Another factor holding out hope for the U.S. economy is the money supply. The numbers for Divisia M4 including Treasuries -- the broadest gauge for the money supply -- jumped 4.9% in April on a year-ago basis.


Keep in mind that banks account for about 85% of the money supply. They, more than the Fed, are the true story.


**Coming up Thursday**: First-time jobless claims will be released before the stock market’s open. Also released before the open: the Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing survey for May and the Chicago Fed National Activity Index for April. Leading Indicators for April will be released at 10 a.m. ET.


Companies reporting quarterly results before the open include **Toro** ([TTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTC)) and **Wal-Mart Stores** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). After the close, **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) will report.

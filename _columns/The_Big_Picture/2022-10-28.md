Stock Market Uptrend Shows Strength, Shrugs Off Big Tech Earnings; This Key Hurdle Awaits
==========================================================================================

The stock market made a show of strength by surging despite disappointing Big Tech earnings reports. But it is still too early for investors to be getting excited, with another Federal Reserve meeting rapidly approaching.




The Nasdaq composite turned in a 2.9% gain for the day and is on track to end October with a 5% gain. It still sits 1.9% under the key [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), a key resistance area to watch.


The S&P 500 turned in a 2.5% gain for the day. Using the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) as a proxy, it is up 8.9% for the month with one more session left in October. The index has made a move above its 50-day line, an encouraging sign.


Breadth was also positive, with advancers outnumbering decliners by about 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and early data showed lower NYSE volume.


Blue-chip stocks also excelled, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average popping 2.6%. Its 14.4% gain so far for October is on track for its best since January 1976, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It closed above the 200-day line for first time since Aug. 18. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was the top performer here, charging 7.6% as it enjoyed its best day since 2020. Its [earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-iphone-maker-warns-of-holiday-slowdown/) was the driver.

Inflation Data Boosts Markets As Fed Awaits
-------------------------------------------


Stocks were given a boost by new personal income and spending data. The September core personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, increased 0.5% from August, in line with views. While it rose 5.1% year over year, it came in below consensus expectations for 5.2%.


The coming week will be crucial, with speculation rising that the Federal Reserve may be considering slowing the pace of rate hikes.


At this stage, the Federal Open Market Committee, led by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, may opt to be noncommittal. Investors should remain wary until this meeting is in the rearview mirror. Becoming too heavily invested at this stage could be a costly error.


These Industry Groups Excel As Stocks Muscle Higher
---------------------------------------------------


As ever, the industry groups provide crucial insight into market action for [CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


On Friday, education stocks, wireless telecom services, consumer electronics retailers and insurance brokers were among the best performers.


In contrast, coal stocks, steel producers, metal miners and medical outpatient plays lagged. Internet retailers also struggled, no surprise given that group behemoth **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) plunged 6.8% on a [disastrous quarterly report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amzn-stock-falls-on-earnings-report/).

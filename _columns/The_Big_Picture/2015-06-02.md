Stock Indexes Dip, Remain Trendless
====================================

The stock market continued its sluggish pace Tuesday as the major indexes traded within a narrow price band. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 edged down 0.1%. Both climbed no more than 0.3% and fell no more than 0.7% during the session. Small caps held on to gains, with the Russell 2000 adding 0.2%.

  

Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE.

  

With the market content to sit tight, growth stocks don't have much fuel to rise from their chart entries. It's likely frustrating for investors. The sideways trend may last much longer, with summer breaks approaching on Wall Street.

  

But amid the dull trading, a couple of good signs surfaced.

  

The S&P again found support at its 50-day moving average. Winning stocks led losers by nearly 7 to 5 on the Nasdaq and about 6 to 5 on the NYSE.

  

So far, distribution in the indexes remains acceptable, and most of the top stocks are holding up.

  

But in the context of the bull market's years-long advance, any flattening trend raises concerns and warrants vigilant investing.

  

For now, the market is signaling an uptrend, so investors should hold stocks. If the market rolls over, there will be more distribution to warn participants.

  

Granted, it's hard to make any money with leading stocks in a flat market. The IBD 50 lagged Tuesday with an 0.4% drop.

  

But being too much in cash means missing out on potential winners.

  

The Nasdaq continues to hold an edge over the large-cap S&P 500. The latter's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is at the lowest possible level. The Nasdaq's is neutral.

  

The composite's 7%-plus year-to-date gain also beats the S&P 500's 2.5% advance.

  

Gains in the technology sector have helped the Nasdaq outperform. Chinese stocks also are contributing to the imbalance.

  

More than 160 Chinese stocks are in IBD's database, and they've outpaced the S&P 500 by an average of roughly 1,500 basis points (or 15 percentage points) so far this year. Nearly 60% are listed on the Nasdaq and one-third on the S&P.

  

The broad market remains news-driven. Some medical and chip stocks have done well on news of acquisitions. Earnings reports also have triggered share movements.

  

On Tuesday, the market didn't have much news other than auto sales for May.

  

**General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) and **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) beat estimates. But sales of top foreign automakers were mixed. IBD's automakers industry group was down modestly.

  

Greece is still in focus. Negotiations over a financial lifeline were at an impasse, Bloomberg reported.

  

Energy, metal, transportation and financial stocks led.

  

Utilities, chipmakers and airlines were among the weakest.

  

A few top-rated stocks broke out. **AerCap Holdings** ([AER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AER)) cleared a long base in heavy trading. Late Monday, the aircraft leasing firm said that **American International Group** ([AIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIG)) will sell part of its stake in the company.

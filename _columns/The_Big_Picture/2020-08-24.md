The Nasdaq and S&P 500 made record highs again, marking five months of a remarkable recovery from the steepest bear market in history. But indexes could be getting ready for a pullback.




The S&P 500 rose 1% after a rally in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4% and topped its Aug 11. high â€” a technical victory.


The Nasdaq composite had been struggling to keep up until the last-hour advance. It closed 0.6% higher. Nasdaq-heavy industry groups in software, biotech and health care underperformed.


Stock Market Analysis: The Nasdaq's Upper Channel
-------------------------------------------------


Studying the Nasdaq chart, the index is now close to the upper channel line where it has pulled back several times since the index bottomed in March. The S&P 500 also appears to be near an upper channel that spans a two-month period.

Several positive news items on the coronavirus pandemic encouraged the stock market Monday.


The Financial Times on Sunday reported the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration could approve as early as October a coronavirus vaccine that AstraZeneca is developing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/azn-stock-jumps-report-coronavirus-vaccine-approval/). President Trump announced that the FDA authorized use of convalescent plasma to treat seriously ill Covid-19 patients, though some experts were skeptical.


On Monday, **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) announced it's nearing a deal to [supply 80 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine to Europe](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mrna-stock-slips-coronavirus-vaccine-trials/). The company also said it's on track to complete enrollment of 30,000 participants in its late-stage vaccine test next month.


Is The Coronavirus Trade Unwinding?
-----------------------------------


Some of the work- and learn-at-home stocks tumbled Monday, an early sign that the coronavirus trade may be unwinding. **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)), **Teladoc Health** ([TDOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDOC)) and **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) were some of the notable losers. Chegg was reduced in size in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) after initially joining [the list](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on May 5.


Even the mighty **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) didn't exactly dazzle with its breakout. The stock rose above the 3,344.39 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) but closed below it, and volume was soft.


Many of those coronavirus plays are in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), which limped to a 0.2% gain.


Transports Lead Stock Market
----------------------------


Monday's industry group table showed a market hopeful of an end to the pandemic, as cyclical, financial and transportation issues led.



The Dow Jones Transportation Average rallied 1.9% as airlines topped IBD's 197 industry groups with an 8% surge. Apparel and banks were among the top groups. The travel booking group added more than 3%.


While the pandemic is slowing in the U.S., the disease has been shown to reappear with ease. That makes full containment quite difficult, and leaves the stock market at some risk. U.S. Covid-19 cases have been trending lower since mid-July, but now cases are climbing again in some European countries.


"Medical progress will support markets broadly, but the ebb and flow of the pandemic's development is driving divergent regional performance," Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of Global Wealth Management at UBS, said in a report. "Europe's rising caseload, for example, helps explain the underperformance of the Stoxx Europe 600, which fell 0.8% last week."


S&P 500: Distribution Days Shrink
---------------------------------


The S&P 500 July 21 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is now off the count after the index climbed more than 5% from that day's close. The S&P closed slightly higher July 21, but low in the daily price range, which resulted in stalling action.


The deduction now leaves the S&P 500 with a single distribution day, and the Nasdaq with three distribution days. That's a normal load of distribution, and an indication that the stock market can continue marching higher.


Most sectors rose Monday, but none more than energy. Two major storms headed for oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. The region accounts for 17% of total U.S. oil production and 5% of U.S. natural gas output. But oil prices rose only a fraction, to $42.37 a barrel late Monday.

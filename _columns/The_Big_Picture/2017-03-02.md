Stock indexes spun lower Thursday in a weak follow-up to the previous session's big gains.


The Nasdaq retreated 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 dropped 1.2%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.

The Nasdaq hasn't delivered back-to-back gains of 1% or more since it did it three days in a row June 28-30.


For the bulls, the follow-up consolation prize would've been a small or moderate loss in declining volume, which suggests institutions — the true market shapers — aren't selling aggressively. Yet if a consolation prize is what the market delivered Thursday, it just barely qualified.


Selling picked up in the final 45 minutes, lifting the day's loss. This is not what the bulls wanted to see. The lower volume, though, lessened the sting.


Meanwhile, lowly rated groups and sectors comprised most of the day's gainers.


The Dow utility average was one of the few indexes rising, adding 0.8%. The utility sector is middle of the pack among 33 sectors.


Retail, which is also lowly rated, accounted for some winners. 


**Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) sprang 6% as it retook its 50-day moving average line. The stock is not highly rated but has posted strong earnings growth (51% and 27%) in the past two quarters.


**Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) thrust about 7% to a new high. The midcap has posted strong earnings gains in the past four quarters (39%, 105%, 104% and 21%).


Two other stocks made big splashes Thursday.


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) staggered 4% lower in heavy volume on news that federal agents conducted searches at its headquarters and two other Illinois facilities. Caterpillar indicated that it was related to an ongoing tax investigation.


Initial public offering **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) was priced at 17 but opened at 24 and closed at 24.48. The IPO has received a lot of press attention. However, history would suggest caution for investors. The company has lost money in each of the past eight quarters even as revenue soared.


Other IPOs getting tons of press attention on their debuts included **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) in 2012; **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) in 2013; and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) in 2014.


In each case, an individual investor would've been better off waiting for a breakout from an IPO base before buying shares.

With a critical inflation report due Friday morning, traders still sent the S&P 500 to a new high Thursday. And the Nasdaq composite remains at its highest level since it touched a record on July 16.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% to rebound from Wednesday's bearish downside reversal. The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, while the Nasdaq composite moved up 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 index climbed 0.6%.


Seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with materials and technology leading the way. The energy and real estate sectors paced the losers.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Ahead of Friday's stock market open, the Commerce Department will release its monthly personal income and outlays report for August. Personal income is expected to rise 0.4% on the month. The core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index is estimated to increase 0.2% for the month, with an annual rise of 2.7%.


The core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge.

Dow Jones Winners And Losers
----------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Dow** ([DOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) were among the biggest winners Thursday with gains of 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively.


On the downside, **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) were the biggest losers during the session, down 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively.


[A majority of the Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/) ended lower as the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)) exchange traded fund fell 0.2%. Notably, Mag 7 stock **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is building a cup with handle that has a 441.85 entry. But the stock's relative strength line is lagging.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 0.8% Thursday. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) rallied 2.5% to finish out of buy range beyond a 175.45 cup-with-handle entry.

What To Do Now
--------------


The S&P 500 is close to [triggering a power trend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-condition-called-power-trend-is-when-you-really-need-to-be-buying/), while the [Nasdaq entered one today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-market-rally-power-trend-ai-stocks-super-micro-dive/). That adds a layer of bullishness to an already positive market. A power trend is a part of [IBD's Market School](https://get.investors.com/online-courses/market-school/) trading rules and represents unusually bullish trading conditions.


Amid the ongoing stock market rally, IBD has an 80%-100% recommended exposure threshold, which means that investors should be heavily invested. Investors who need to add more exposure should look for market leaders breaking out past correct entries.


But investors shouldn't become complacent. The current environment still requires [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of theÂ [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That means incrementally adding and reducing exposure to stay in sync with the broad market. That means identifying sell signals and other abrupt character changes, like **MakeMyTrip** ([MMYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMYT)), which plunged more than 11% Thursday.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s Breaking Out Today list featured just one stock, adding to the shortlist of breakouts this week. Notably, **Arm Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)) briefly lifted above a cup-with-handle entry at 149.93.


Meanwhile, there are another 12 ideas appearing on MarketSurge's Near Pivot list. That suggests there are more buying opportunities ready to emerge.

S&P 500 Leader Nvidia Extends Win Streak
----------------------------------------


Amid the stock market rebound, leaders to watch include **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Reddit** ([RDDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RDDT)) **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)) and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)).


[IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Nvidia has a 131.26 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) from an irregular handle. Investors also could use the Sept. 12 high of 120.79 as a much smaller handle and an early buy trigger. according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) pattern recognition. Shares also edged higher Thursday, extending a three-day win streak.


Social media platform Reddit is building a cup base with a 78.08 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) pattern recognition. Investors should be on the lookout for the [IBD SwingTrader idea](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) to add a handle.


Texas Roadhouse is attempting to break out above a 177.72 flat-base entry. And Wingstop topped a 431.03 entry earlier this week, but is below it.

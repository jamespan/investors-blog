  Dow Jones Sets Fast Pace As Stock Market Surges

Blue chips and small caps led the stock market Friday, as the indexes shrugged off two news items that had been a recurring concern.




The Dow Jones and the small-cap Russell 2000 sprinted ahead 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively. The large-cap S&P 500 advanced 1.1%. The Nasdaq lagged with a 0.6% gain.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and preliminary data showed flat volume on the NYSE. Friday was an options expiration day, which often boosts volume. The market also faced a three-day weekend.


The exchanges are closed Monday for Presidents Day.


News Shrugged Off
-----------------


News that President Donald Trump would sign a compromise budget deal didn't prove to be the final word. Trump later declared a national emergency to give him the funds to build a border wall.

The legal dispute could now go as far as the U.S. Supreme Court.


Meanwhile, two days of trade talks with China brought no discernible progress.


Although both the shutdown and tariffs have been headaches for the stock market, the Street shrugged off the news Friday.


For stock market bulls, this was a good sign. Any dispute is only as big as the stock market says it is, and the market seemed to be telling the nervous camp to calm down.


Markets have been known to climb a wall of worry.


Banks, Oils Climb
-----------------


On Friday, banks and oil stocks were doing the climbing. This partially explained the Nasdaq's underperformance. For instance, the Nasdaq 100 has zero banks and zero oil stocks. And none of the money-center stocks are Nasdaq-listed.


So, the Nasdaq composite benefited not a bit as seven of the U.S. money center banks knifed higher: **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) popped 3%; **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), 3%; **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), 3%; **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), 3%; **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), 2.5%; **Bank of New York Mellon** ([BK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BK)), 2%; and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), 1%.


Volume, though, was below average for all seven.


Warren Buffett's Q4 Move
------------------------


A factor that may have helped the banks was news that Warren Buffett's **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)) increased its bank stake in Q4. Roughly 40% of [Berkshire's holdings](https://www.investors.com/news/warren-buffett-stocks-berkshire-hathway-q4-2018-13f/) are financials.


In the meantime, oil stocks had a good week. The oil-equipment stock group rose 10.5%. International explorers and U.S. explorers advanced 8% and 7.9%, respectively.


Going into Friday's session, the energy sector was up 14.4% year to date.


The Coming Week
---------------


On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its January meeting.

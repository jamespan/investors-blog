The stock market ended mixed Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surging as **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) soared more than 23% on [strong sales results](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) and a $40 billion stock buyback.




Key earnings reports after the close included **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). Next up, investors will shift their attention to Friday's pivotal jobs report.


[Apple missed](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-falls-on-december-quarter-miss/) Wall Street's sales and earnings targets for its fiscal first quarter. Apple stock slid nearly 4% in extended trade. [Amazon reported](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amzn-stock-fourth-quarter-earnings-amazon/) fourth-quarter results that beat on revenue but missed on earnings. AMZN stock sold off 4% in extended trading. Alphabet shares dropped 3.7% after [reporting December-quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-google-earnings-googl-stock-q42022/) and revenue that missed Wall Street targets amid slowing growth in internet search advertising, YouTube ads and cloud computing services. Index futures traded lower in the after-hours session.

Jobs Report, Earnings Results
-----------------------------


Wall Street economists expect the [Labor Department's jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-is-first-big-test-after-federal-reserve-lets-loose-the-sp500/) to show a 185,000 rise in payrolls, down from 223,000 in December. Per Econoday, December was the eighth straight month and 10th of the last 11 that payroll growth exceeded estimates. Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3% on the month, lowering the 12-month gain to 4.4% from 4.6%. The unemployment rate should tick up to 3.6% from the current 3.5% rate that's tied for the lowest in more than a half-century.


Friday's jobs report comes on the heels of Wednesday's ADP employment report that saw jobs numbers miss estimates. ADP said payrolls grew by 106,000, much lower than the expected 158,000 figure.


More key earnings reports included **Bristol Myers Squibb** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)), **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)), **ELF Beauty** ([ELF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELF)) and **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)). Bristol shares rose 2.2% Thursday. Conoco shares tumbled 5.4%. Eli Lilly and Merck dropped 3.5% and 3.3%, respectively. And ELF Beauty stock soared 15%.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, and the S&P 500 gained 1.5%. The Nasdaq composite rallied nearly 3.3%, as the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.1%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the prior session. The S&P 500's Jan. 17 distribution day was wiped off due to a 5% rise from that day's close. That leaves the index with just one day of institutional selling.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) climbed 1% Thursday as the ETF of top growth stocks made it a three-day win streak. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Toast** ([TOST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOST)) advanced 6.9% to move further above a 23.10 consolidation buy point.


IBD's [stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) is in a "confirmed uptrend" amid strong gains since early January, when the Nasdaq signaled a [follow-through day on Jan. 6](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-powers-higher-in-first-rally-of-2023-these-groups-fare-best/). Given the market's ongoing strength, it makes sense to raise your exposure if your trades are doing well, with an invested percentage of 60%-80%, as recommended in [last Friday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-gains-as-it-heads-into-key-fed-meeting-tesla-stock-helps-this-group/). Winning trades should push you closer to the 80% threshold, especially after more strong gains among leading stocks. But don't hesitate to lock in some gains around the 20%-25% profit zones.

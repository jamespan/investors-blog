The stock market rallied strongly after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell calmed fears after the central bank finally moved to raise interest rates Wednesday.




While indexes wavered following the initial Fed announcement, the nation's top banker delivered a soothing press conference that impressed investors.


The Nasdaq ended the day up 3.8%. While it has some way to go to repair the damage of recent months, it managed to punch above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


In addition, the S&P 500 closed the session with a 2.2% gain. Sustained progress could see the 50-day moving average move back above the [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-200-day-moving-average/) in short order. The 50-day line crossed below the 200-day earlier this week.

Blue chips lagged a bit, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average still jumped 1.5%.


More interesting was the performance of small caps and growth stocks. The Russell 2000 popped 3.1% while the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) rallied out of the red to move 2.3% higher.


Bullish Action Triggers Key Outlook Change
------------------------------------------


With volume higher on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange and with the S&P 500 rising more than 2%, the [market has now returned to a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/). Wednesday's higher-volume gains constituted a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) rally confirmation.


Investors should take action to increase exposure now, though a gradual approach makes sense given the volatility of the past few months.


Remember, there is still significant headline risk going forward. Inflation remains a key issue while the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a wild card that has proved its ability to shake the market.

Stock Market Whisperer Powell Strikes Again
-------------------------------------------


The headline for the day is the fact that the [Federal Reserve has announced its first rate rise since 2018](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-one-rate-hike-down-six-to-go-dow-jones/). But it is the detailed outlook on rate hikes that is of more use to the market.


On top of the imminent quarter-point lift, which had been telegraphed already, the central bank sees six additional quarter-point hikes this year.


With inflation running at levels not seen since the early 1980s, it was vital for the Fed to finally grasp the nettle and start to tackle the problem head-on.


Nevertheless, the market pared some gains until Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave an assuring press conference.


Powell said the Federal Market Open Committee recognizes the need to "return the economy to price stability" and said the Fed is "determined to use our tools to do exactly that." He also touted the overall strength of the U.S. economy at the moment.


Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said the press conference showed "Powell is getting serious about taking on inflation."


"The Fed is in a position where they can deliver supersized hikes and announce the balance-sheet runoff at the next policy meeting," he told IBD. "The Fed basically removed the risk of a policy mistake that will be too late in fighting inflation."


These Groups Thrive Amid As Bulls Take Charge
---------------------------------------------


The performance of the IBD Industry Groups provides crucial clues to investors about which areas could be set to shine or wither.


Among those making the strongest gains on Wednesday were education, media and database software stocks. Metal products distributors, department stores and leisure services were also flexing their muscles.


And a number of areas that had showed uncommon strength were reversing. The agricultural chemicals group — which features highflying fertilizer plays such as **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) and **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) — was the worst performer. Coal, oil & gas drillers and defense stocks also struggled.


These Noteworthy Stocks Pass Buy Points
---------------------------------------


A trio of strong stocks managed to stage breakouts amid the bullish action.


Trucking stock **J.B. Hunt** ([JBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBH)) powered past a flat-base entry of 208.97 in high volume. It ended the day near the top of its buy zone after surging 9.6%. The move saw the stock join the [Leaderboard list of leading stocks](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).



J.B. Hunt announced a partnership with **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKB))-owned railroad BNSF to expand capacity in the intermodal delivery market.


**UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) closed the day just under its buy point after earlier peeking above a 501.03 [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) entry. The relative strength line has just hit a new high on its weekly chart.


**Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) closed the day in a buy zone after breaking out of a flat base. The ideal entry here is 673.96, and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) is spiking. The firm has benefited from its Covid antiviral treatments and has a range of other drugs that add to its top and bottom lines.

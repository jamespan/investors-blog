The main indexes pared gains Tuesday, as the market pauses from a strong November advance.


The Nasdaq made a record high and was up as much as 0.7% before it closed 0.2% higher. The S&P 500 also trimmed gains and climbed 0.1%. The Russell 2000 gave up earlier gains and closed a fraction lower. The small-cap benchmark is due for a break after ending a 15-day win streak on Monday.


A backward trend in afternoon trading caused the Nasdaq to close in the lower half of the day's price range. It would result in stalling — a subtle form of [distribution](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764), i.e., institutional-size selling. Volume increased across the board, which confirmed the stall-type distribution.


For the Nasdaq, it was the ninth day of distribution in the past several weeks. It's an alarming number that indicates a crack in the market. Yet, the two distribution days this week have been questionable. Monday's loss came on an increase in volume that was inevitable after Friday's half session, and Tuesday's stall didn't have the look of institutions selling into strength.


Other indicators point to a normalized uptrend. ![MP112916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP112916-162x300.png)The put-call volume ratio is below 1.0, but not by much; the CBOE market volatility index is back to its usual trend after spiking in early part of November; the ratio of the new highs to new lows is at a normal 2.0; and margin debt is normal as well. (These indicators are found in the [IBD Psychological Market Indicators](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) page.)


Some distribution days are getting dated and are set to expire within several days. With modest gains in the indexes, a few more distribution days could lop off the count.


One of the best aspects of the November market rally has been the productive gains that many stocks have made from breakouts. That's a bullish shift from earlier in the year, when too often breakouts stalled out or resulted in unsatisfying gains.


Financials, pharmaceuticals and heavy infrastructure-related stocks emerged as the new market leaders. But now a lot of those investments are pausing. That's normal.


Pullbacks may provide secondary buy areas, but so far few are in such formations. Investors will probably see fresh breakouts before finding follow-on opportunities in pullbacks.


Leading stocks are largely holding their advances. On the IBD 50, the average stock is just 3.4% from its 52-week high. The IBD 50 rose 0.3% Tuesday.


Tuesday's trading got a boost from the health care sector. Insurer **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) gave a strong outlook for next year, and shares leapt nearly 4% to a record high. Other managed-care stocks rose too; **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) hit its highest level since June 2015. **WellCare Health Plans** ([WCG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCG)) reached a record high.


Managed-care, long-term care, outpatient care, medical services and medical supplies were other health care industry groups that rose more than 1%.


But the energy sector was down ahead of a critical OPEC meeting to decide on production curbs. Oil prices figure to tumble if no accord is reached.

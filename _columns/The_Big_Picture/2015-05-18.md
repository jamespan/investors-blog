Stocks started weak but finished with gains Monday.

  

The S&P rose 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1%. Both scored new highs.

  

Although it didn't hit a new high, the tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied 0.6%. Chips, security software and biotechs gave strong showings.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which makes up almost 8% of the Nasdaq, rose 1%. In a letter to CEO Tim Cook, activist investor Carl Icahn wrote that Apple's stock is worth 240 a share.

  

The small-cap Russell 2000 and the IBD 50 jumped 1.1% each.

  

Stocks had trouble finding direction early in the day despite M&A news. **Endo International** ([ENDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENDP)) said it's buying Par Pharmaceutical from private equity firm TPG, and **Ascena Retail Group** ([ASNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASNA)) said it's buying **Ann Inc.** ([ANN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANN)), the parent of Ann Taylor and Loft.

  

There was also a report by the New York Post that **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Altera** ([ALTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALTR)) are resuming merger talks. Stocks also had to contend with Greek drama (see [International Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing-international-leaders/051815-753111-greece-end-game-good-or-bad-in-sight.htm)) and disappointing housing data.

  

Volume ended lower on both major exchanges from Friday's pace, which was soft despite options expiration. The Nasdaq had its lightest session since April 20.

  

While it's still early in the new market uptrend (the Nasdaq staged a follow-through Thursday), the market is doing what it should be doing so far.

  

The major indexes have avoided distribution days since the follow-through. Breakouts are taking place among top-rated stocks, which is giving investors buying opportunities.

  

**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) took out a 102.87 buy point from a flat base in fast turnover. This is its first base breakout in more than a year.

  

**Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) blew past a 78.10 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. The stock previously broke out in March, but fizzled quickly.

  

Both Skyworks and Qorvo are Apple suppliers.

  

**Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) tried to for a breakout, but volume was weak. Trade should be at least 40% above average on a breakout.

  

Investors should aim to buy leaders soon after the market puts in a follow-through signal, because many of the biggest winners tend to come out of bases in the first few weeks of an uptrend.

  

Leaders such as **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)), **Mckesson** ([MCK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCK)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) have already cleared bases recently. Criteo is extended, but the latter two are still within buying range.

The stock market finished the week strong, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq led the major stock indexes higher Friday. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 ended near session highs.




The Nasdaq climbed 1.4% Friday, while the S&P 500 moved up 1.1%. The Dow Jones industrials gained 0.7% and the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.8%.


Leading growth stocks sharply outperformed, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) traded up nearly 3.6% Friday. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), No. 14-ranked **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) climbed 5.7% Friday, breaking out above a 544.93 buy point in a cup with handle. Shares closed in the 5% buy range. HubSpot was [Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/hubspot-stock-advances-on-new-product-roll-out-with-earnings-ahead/).


Volume ended lower on the Nasdaq and NYSE compared with Thursday's figures.

Stock Market Direction
----------------------


![MP042321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP042321-255x300.jpg)The Nasdaq snapped back from Thursday's sharp losses fueled by a report that President Biden is seeking to hike capital gains taxes. The composite closed back above 14,000 price level, which the index has had trouble decisively clearing. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 hit a new high amid the day's strong gains.


The overall [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains light. The S&P 500 holds three distribution days, while the Nasdaq has two.


With modest levels of institutional selling, investors should remain focused on buying stocks breaking out past [new buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). However, earnings season is in full force, and buying a stock before earnings is a dangerous proposition.


On the upside, blowout results can lead to [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) to new highs. But disappointing results can send shares tumbling. Check out [IBD's options strategy](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) to limit risk around earnings.

The stock market ended Friday higher after President Donald Trump spoke out on tariffs, with indexes ending a weekly losing streak. Now the latest PCE inflation data and a consumer confidence reading is due.


The Nasdaq composite benefited from a late surge of buying as it notched a daily lift of 0.5%. More important, it snapped a four-week losing streak due to a weekly lift of 0.2%. Nevertheless, it continues to languish below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and its 200-day line. The tech-heavy index remains down 7.9% for the year.




The S&P 500 squeezed out a tiny 0.1% gain Friday and narrowed the gap slightly on its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). It rose for the first week in five thanks to a 0.5% rise. However, the benchmark index remains down 3.6% so far in 2025.


Decliners significantly outnumbered advancers on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. Volume was higher on both exchanges amid triple witching day, which is when stock options, index futures and index options simultaneously expire.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 32 points as it gained 0.1%. It is just a hair below its 200-day line, notching a 1.2% weekly gain. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) fared best with a 3.1% lift, but **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) gave up 5.5% despite beating earnings views.


Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 falling 0.6% Friday. Its 50-day line is on track to undercut the 200-day moving average, a bearish technical move known as a "death cross." It is nearly 7% below both benchmarks.


The Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) exchange traded fund reversed higher to post a fractional gain Friday. Its weekly jump of 2.1% was more impressive.


While Friday's late comeback was encouraging, Investor's Business Daily continues to recommend exposure in the range of 0% to 20%. Concentrate on defense and building up a robust watchlist of stocks that are showing relative strength.


It is worth noting that the NYSE ended above its 200-day line, a sign of improving breadth in the market.


Trump Talks Tariffs, PCE Inflation Report Looms
-----------------------------------------------


Stocks ended off their post-Fed meeting weekly highs amid ongoing uncertainty ahead of the so-called "tariff day" on April 2. However, Trump hinted Friday there could be some wiggle room on levies.

While the president voiced resistance to making exceptions, he did tell reporters that "the word flexibility is an important word." Trump added that "there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal."


Trump also said he is planning to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, but did not say when. U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer is scheduled to speak with his Chinese counterpart next week. A more positive U.S.-China relationship could help stocks.


A number of noteworthy economic readings are due in the week ahead. The latest S&P flash U.S. services and manufacturing PMI data lands Monday, The Conference Board's consumer confidence report for March comes Tuesday and durable-goods orders data is due Wednesday.


The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index reading for February drops Friday and is especially important amid current investor worries over potential stagflation. It is also the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation.


Earnings season has slowed to a crawl but there are still [some noteworthy reports to look out for](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/chewy-mccormick-paychex-atour-earnings/). **Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)), **McCormick** ([MKC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKC)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and [IBD Sector Leader](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/sectorleaders) **Atour Lifestyle** ([ATAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATAT)) are among the firms posting quarterly results.


Tesla Pop Boosts Automakers
---------------------------


A majority of [the S&P 500 sectors ended Friday lower](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/sectors/) despite the positive index action. Communication services, consumer discretionary and technology fared best while materials and real estate lagged.



The relative performance of the 197 IBD industry groups gave a more granular account of the action [on the stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Book companies, discount retailers, internet content firms and computer hardware plays were among the best performers. Automakers were also strong after **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) surged 5.3%, though it remains below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/).


By contrast, oil and gas royalty trusts, metal products distributors and steel producers were among the worst laggards. The airfreight group also lagged after **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) fell 6.5% in high volume after missing earnings views.

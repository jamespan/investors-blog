Blue chips kept the market on a worn path Thursday, as the Dow Jones industrial average again led the major indexes.




The Dow stepped up 0.3%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.3%. The S&P 500 inched up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq slipped 0.1%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The Dow is working on its seventh consecutive up week. During that run, the Dow rose 7% vs. 4% and 3% gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, respectively.


Longer term, the Dow has also set the pace. Beginning in April, the Dow grabbed the lead and hasn't let go.

Trump's Fed Choice Near
-----------------------


President Trump is expected to soon name his nominee to lead the Federal Reserve. The announcement is expected before he leaves Nov. 3 for a 12-day trip to Asia.


Doubts surround the possible candidates, but through no fault of their own. Uncertainty is always the enemy of the stock market, so the least disruptive choice — at least on a short-term basis — would be to reappoint Janet Yellen.


If Trump decides to go with a new chief, the market will have to size up and sort out the change. Some reports say Yellen won't be reappointed.


Recent bouts of [distribution](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) — a sign of institutional selling — may suggest that the market is already preparing for change. In other words, funds at first sell to raise some cash, and once the choice is known, the money will go to the favorites under the new reality.


Earnings Still Key
------------------


Along with the Fed factor, earnings season continues to play a decisive role in price performance.


Most of Thursday's big gainers in strong volume reported results that trampled expectations.


For example, chipmaker **STMicroelectronics** ([STM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STM)) gapped up more than 10%, after beating earnings estimates by 14%.


**Gardner Denver** ([GDI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDI)) gapped up 9% after topping earnings views by 14%.


Bears In China Shop
-------------------


On Thursday, China stocks took a hit. Big losers included **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), off 14%; **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), down 7%; and **China Lodging** ([HTHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HTHT)), down 4%.


Among China stocks trading on U.S. exchanges, losers led winners by a 9-to-5 ratio. In China, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.3%, notching its fifth daily gain in a row.


In economic news, the first take on third-quarter GDP will be released before the market's open. The Street's consensus view calls for 2.5% growth. The range of estimates runs from 1.9% to 2.9%.

Nasdaq, S&P 500 Tell Different Tales; Infrastructure-Tied Stocks Up
====================================================================

U.S. stock indexes started strong Friday but then faded to a divergence of sorts. One index closed high in the day's range and the other ended low in the range.




 The Nasdaq kept a 0.4% gain after being up 0.8%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.


The closes were bullishly high in the day's range for the S&P 500 and the Dow, but bearishly low in the range for the Nasdaq.


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Recent chart action has been discouraging. During the week, the Nasdaq suffered three negative reversals to close low in the day's range. The S&P 500 incurred two such days.

Meanwhile, several issues remain unsettled.


Thursday's IBD identified five issues that the stock market must deal with.


One was settled Friday. Nonfarm payrolls were about 20% more than expected. By now, the pessimists are having a tough time disputing the bullish arguments on the economy.


Another issue will be settled Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve concludes its two-day meeting and reveals its decision on interest rates.


Analysts expect a quarter-point increase.


The remaining three issues involve the shepherding of the tax-cut bill, a partial repeal of Dodd-Frank banking regulations and infrastructure policy.


On the tax-cut bill, fog obscures its prospects. On Friday, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she may vote against the final version if it strips out her amendments. Collins' amendments relate to the property tax deduction and a medical deduction.


A bipartisan Dodd-Frank bill cleared the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, but there was no news Friday.


The cement stocks, though, are rallying. **U.S. Concrete** ([USC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USC)) jumped almost 4% Friday and **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)) 1.6% as both followed through on breakouts; and **Summit Materials** ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)) 3%, a gain that involved a breakout.


Another area that showed strength Friday was steel. **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) broke out. Recently, a ruling on dumping went against China and Vietnam.


For the week, the S&P 500 and the Dow each rose 0.4%. The Nasdaq slipped 0.1%.

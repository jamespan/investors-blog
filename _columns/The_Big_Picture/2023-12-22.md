  Stock Market Makes It 8 Straight Weekly Gains; This Index Keeps Rocking

The stock market pared gains Friday but still capped an eighth straight weekly advance that continues to test buyers' resolve.




The S&P 500 had been up nearly 0.6% during the session but it ended up only 0.2% higher. Still, the index's eight-week win streak is the longest in six years.


The Nasdaq composite, which also reduced Friday's gain to 0.2%, matched an April-June weekly win streak. While the Nasdaq climbed 1.2% for the week, it has stalled its progress around the 15,000 level. Large round numbers sometimes act as resistance levels, making this a potential threshold.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed for an eighth consecutive week, the longest streak since a nine-week run in early 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data. On Friday, the Dow faded to a loss of less than 0.1%. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) cost the Dow 95 points after plunging 11.8% [on a weak outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-sinks-after-q2-earnings-dow-giant-plans-to-streamline-business/). It was also the worst performing stock in the S&P 500.


Volume fell on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, as often happens on the Friday before a long weekend. The stock market closes for Monday's Christmas holiday.


Small Caps Lead Stock Market
----------------------------


Small caps led again, as the Russell 2000 jumped 0.8% and 2.5% for the week. The index looks to have cleared potential resistance at the 2000 level.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MP122223-273x300.jpg)The stock market is wrapping up a strong 2023 with seemingly everything going its way. Indexes are rising with participation from small caps, growth, financials and other sectors. Economic reports point to a soft landing. Treasury yields are in decline. Seasonal factors — the Santa Claus rally, in particular — are another positive.


And inflation [continues to cool](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-key-inflation-rate-just-hit-2-percent-sp-500-rallies-as-rate-cut-odds-grow/). On Friday, the Fed's most valuable inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, [slowed to 0.1% in November](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-key-inflation-rate-just-hit-2-percent-sp-500-rallies-as-rate-cut-odds-grow/) and 2.6% on an annual basis.


But as the stock market's win streak extends, the odds of a pullback keep rising. While IBD recommends 80%-100% exposure, it is smart to be ready to take profits.


As today's [Inside the IBD 50 column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/crwd-stock-other-ibd-50-stocks-have-rallied-into-profit-zones/) notes, many winners are in price areas where at least some profit-taking is justified.


Leading Stocks Performing Well
------------------------------


Growth leaders are performing admirably.


Since the stock market bottomed on Oct. 27, the IBD 50 index is outperforming the S&P 500 — up 20.3% vs. 15.5% for the S&P. The IBD 50 is also beating the Nasdaq 100, which has climbed 18.3%, and the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)), which is up 17.6%. On Friday, the IBD 50 eased 0.2% and rose 0.4% for the week.


Cybersecurity stocks, such as **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), along with consumer stocks like **Deckers** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **PDD** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)), deserve some of the credit for the gain in the past two months.


A market uptrend needs constant blood flow — i.e, more breakouts. That flow slowed the past week, with 11 stocks in the MarketSmith 250 index breaking out of bases. The previous week, there were 38, according to the Recent Breakouts list in [IBD MarketSmith](https://get.investors.com/marketsmith/).


The good news is that only four of the breakouts in the past few weeks are below their buy points, leaving an excellent win ratio.

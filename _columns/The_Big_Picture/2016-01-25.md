Rally Still Intact, But Late-Session Sell-Off Nails Stocks
===========================================================

The selling resumed in the stock market Monday. Lower volume softened the blow, but it was still an ugly session as selling picked up the pace in the final hour of trading.


Just over 1% of the Nasdaq’s 1.6% loss came in the final hour of trading. The S&P 500 also lost 1.6% and the Dow gave up 1.3%.


The Russell 2000 lagged badly again, falling 2.3%, but that’s not a new story. Unlike the major averages, the small-cap index is in a full-blown bear market, about 23% off its record high marked in June. The Russell 2000 closed below the psychologically important 1000 level again Monday.


![MP012616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MP012616-186x300.jpg)The IBD 50 lost just over 1%. It’s about 19% off its high.


Benchmark crude oil slumped $1.85, or 5.8%, to $30.34 a barrel. Oil dropped below $27 a barrel last week but found its footing after the European Central Bank hinted at more stimulus.


On the NYSE, declining stocks swamped advancers by more than 5-to-1. Nasdaq losers outnumbered winners by around 3-to-1.


Despite the late-session selling, a put-call volume ratio of 1.0 didn’t reveal the excessive fear that has been seen at market bottoms in the past.


Gold and silver miners outperformed again. As of Friday’s close, the group had risen all the way up to No. 26 in IBD’s 197 industry group rankings, up sharply from No. 154 three weeks ago. Utility-related groups dominate the top 20 Monday, proof positive of the market’s defensive stance.


Some pretty big earnings reports on tap this week from the likes of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), plus another decision on interest rates from the Fed Wednesday. According to CME Group FedWatch, the probability of another rate hike by the Fed stands at around 13%.


Bullish technical setups are few and far between, and the ones that do pop up often are lacking in key areas. A consumer staple stock like **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) continues to show relative strength, but it’s hard to get excited about four straight quarters of declining sales growth.


In other cases, average daily dollar volume is an issue.


**Cray** ([CRAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRAY)), for example, cleared a 36.03 buy point Monday. It has a healthy chart, and fundamentals are solid, but an average daily dollar volume of nearly $8 million isn’t the stuff of an institutional-quality leader. A minimum of $20 million to $25 million is a good benchmark to target.


Same with **Physicians Realty Trust** ([DOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOC)), a real estate investment trust. It’s working on a cup-with-handle base with a 17.23 buy point, but its dollar volume is low at around $13 million.

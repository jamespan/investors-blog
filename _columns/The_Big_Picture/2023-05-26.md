The stock market rallied powerfully to end the week higher, buoyed by growing confidence that a debt ceiling agreement will be reached. But there are fresh dangers to overcome once this is achieved.




The Nasdaq composite ended the day with a meaty 2.2% gain. It finished a seesaw week up 2.5% and is back at new highs for the year. Its two-day surge of 3.9% is the best since February. The tech-heavy index has risen for five weeks in a row an is up nearly 25% for the year. A pullback after such strong action would not be a surprise.


The S&P 500 also rose, popping 1.3%. It ended with a slight weekly gain, and its gain of around 10% so far in 2023 means the benchmark index is badly lagging the Nasdaq.


Advancers outnumbered declines by just over 2-to-1 on the NYSE and just under 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq. Volume was lower on the stock market heading into the Memorial Day weekend.


Solid gains for the Direxion Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index ETF ([QQQE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQE)) and the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)) suggest rally participation is broadening, a key positive.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 1% but remains stuck below the key 50-day moving average. It bounced off its 200-day line, however. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was the top gainer here while **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) lagged.

Growth stocks closed off highs for the day, but the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) still rose 1.1%.


Stocks Buoyed As Debt Ceiling Talks Progress
--------------------------------------------


Fears over a possible Federal default weighed on the market earlier in the week. But debt-ceiling talks made progress Friday. Negotiators could reach a deal over the weekend. The Treasury has said it will not run out of money until at least June 5, buying some breathing space.


Nevertheless, there could be more economic upheaval ahead. The Personal Consumption and Expenditures Price Index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, rose 0.4% in April.


With ongoing worries over inflation, the Federal Reserve may feel spurred into action at the next policy meeting. The likelihood of a 25-basis-point hike in June has risen to around 65%, [according to CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html).


"Once a debt deal is done, markets will have to deal with the harsh reality that the Fed is going to kill this economy," Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note to clients.

Marvell Earnings Boost This Stock Market Group
----------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 sectors ended the day mostly positive. Technology and consumer discretionary fared best while health and energy lagged.



Of course, the performance of the IBD industry groups gave a deeper view into Friday's action.


Fiber-optic, computer hardware, networking and movie stocks all had a good day. In addition, a solid earnings report married with a sprinkling of AI hype from **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) helped fabless chip stocks have another powerful session.


Specialty retailers, meat product firms, wholesale drug stocks and health care plays all struggled.

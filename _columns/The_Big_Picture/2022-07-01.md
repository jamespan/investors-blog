Stock Market Starts Second Half With Upbeat Tone, But Faces These 3 Risks In July
==================================================================================

After posting one of the worst first-half performances in decades, the stock market got off to a better start in the second half of 2022.




But the session was rocky. Chip stocks got hammered after **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)), down as much as 7% during Friday's session, gave a [dark revenue outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-micron-delivers-dismal-outlook/) for its August-ending fiscal fourth quarter that came in nearly $2 billion short — not a misprint, $2 billion — of Wall Street's consensus view.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Given that new manufacturing data confirmed economic growth in the U.S. is slowing rapidly, Friday's gains almost felt surprising.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MP070122-300x284.jpg)The Nasdaq composite, hammered 29.5% lower in the first six months of 2022, rose 0.9% Friday. That slightly lagged gains of almost 1.1% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500. The Russell 2000 advanced almost 1.2%. Volume shrank on both main exchanges.


In fact, IBD readers might think it's almost miraculous to see the Nasdaq forge a gain even as semiconductor shares sell off. The VanEck Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) exchange traded fund slumped for a fifth straight day, falling 3.8%.


At its Friday low of 193.63, SMH hit its lowest level since November 2020.


Action was choppy in the first few hours of Friday's session following a [sharp drop in the ISM survey](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) for June to 53 from 56.1 a month earlier. Any reading above 50 marks expanding factory activity. Yet the June number hit a two-year low.



Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas, wrote in a note to clients that "manufacturing is slowing faster than economists anticipated."


But did the report perhaps show a silver lining? "The survey shows that inflationary pressures are cooling. The prices paid subindex fell to 78.5 from 82.2; the index's level is back where it was in the spring of 2018, when CPI inflation was running a little under 3%," Adams noted.


Clearly, the bear market is not a time to be looking for bargains. What may seem cheap prices today may turn out to be expensive later.


In a prolonged bear market, it no doubt takes a lot more time for the forces of demand and supply in the stock market to balance out. Then, when macroeconomic conditions or expectations for the cost of money change, it could tilt the balance in favor of the buyers. Yet for now, keeping the portfolio's powder dry and maintaining very high cash levels remains a smart move.

3 Risk Factors For July
-----------------------


At least three risks could send stocks even lower. One, brace for a [second-quarter earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) that could spur further selling in stocks. Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at BOK Financial in Tulsa, Okla., expects corporate managers to avoid making bullish forecasts for revenue and earnings. Any optimistic outlook may have to wait until later in the year.


"Sector by sector, for oil companies, it's still a time to make money. Their cash flows are fantastic, and earnings look strong," Wyett told IBD. "But in tech and consumer discretionary sectors, it's prudent to be careful about earnings expectations."


Two, keep an eye on interest rates and the yield curve for U.S. Treasury bonds. In a healthy economy, the curve slopes higher. Banks can borrow money at low rates and lend to customers for a profit. But headed into Friday's trading, U.S. Treasury data showed the 2-year note with a yield of 2.92% vs. 2.98% for the benchmark 10-year bond.


"We expect the curve will invert," Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, wrote in a comment to clients. "This Fed is not likely to be quick to shift gears after having unleashed the inflation genie from her bottle after 30-40 years. This Fed is willing to clobber the economy to cool inflation, principally because they can't ease food or energy prices and they are afraid if inflation remains elevated for too long, an inflation psychology could get entrenched in the economy."



**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) (Composite Rating 49, RS Rating 32) belongs to the money center banking group, which ranks in the top half of IBD's 197 industry group rankings. The stock remains locked in a four-month downtrend. A strong move back above the 10-week moving average could hint at a bottom forming.


Third, stock market internals remain bearish. While early data showed winning stocks beat losers on the NYSE by a nearly 3-1 ratio, the NYSE advance-decline remains in a pronounced downtrend. Few stocks are breaking out of good bases. Over the prior five sessions, on average only nine stocks hit 52-week or all-time highs on the NYSE each day. On the Nasdaq, new highs averaged 20 per session.

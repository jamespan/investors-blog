Major averages never found their footing Monday, ending near session lows after a sluggish open.

  

Selling picked up the pace after 12 p.m. ET. At the close, the Nasdaq lost 0.8%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.7%, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6%.

  

Weak economic data out of China were partly to blame. Imports shrank unexpectedly in November while exports slowed. On Nov. 21, China surprised the markets by lowering interest rates to spur growth. The new data mean that more stimuli could be on the horizon.

  

January crude oil fell to a five-year low, dropping $2.79, or 4.2%, to $63.05 a barrel. Oil and gas-related industry groups were thrashed. Exploration and production, service and integrated companies were hard hit. Drillers were also weak.

  

Monday marked an unequivocal day of distribution for the major averages. The distribution day count in the Market Pulse graphic to the right is at a level that's raising yellow flags â€” but not red flags. As always, it's important to stay open-minded by not adopting a stance too bearish or too bullish.

  

The IBD 50 held up relatively well Monday, falling only 0.8%.

  

**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) was the best performer, rising nearly 4% on a strong day for biotechs overall. The group got a boost after **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) agreed to acquire **Cubist Pharmaceuticals** ([CBST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBST)).

  

Other top-rated biotech stocks that made strong moves Monday included **Medivation** ([MDVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDVN)), **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), **Insys Therapeutics** ([INSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INSY)) and **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)).

  

Insys' chart currently shows an early buy point of 43.10. United Therapeutics is working on a flat base with a 137.03 entry.

  

Airlines outperformed again, but most stocks in the group are well extended past a proper buy point. New issue **Virgin America** ([VA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VA)) is carving a potential [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) base, but several quarters in a row of single-digit sales growth doesn't stir excitement.

  

Elsewhere, **Baidu**'s ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) recent breakout over a 231.51 buy point looked good for a while, but the stock's struggling now. Shares lost 2% in heavy volume as they wage battle at the 50-day moving average. The stock hasn't flashed a sell signal, but a 9% gain from the buy point is gone.

  

Other names struggling after recent breakouts include **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) and **FleetCor** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)).

  

Two setups worth watching, however, are **NetSuite** ([N](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=N)) and **WageWorks** ([WAGE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WAGE)). Both are working on deep cup-with-handle patterns, showing sound action in the handle area.

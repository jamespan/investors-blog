Federal Reserve Statement Fails To Excite Stock Market Bulls
=============================================================

Stock market bulls got exactly what they wanted from the Federal Reserve Wednesday — another dovish policy statement — but a post-Fed pop by the major stock indexes faded by the close.




The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 recovered from intraday losses of 0.6% to 0.7%, respectively, but sellers came back into the market late in the session. Stocks were spooked earlier after President Trump said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods could stay on for a long period of time. The comment came after Bloomberg reported Tuesday that some U.S. officials are worried that China might renege on some concessions.


Federal Reserve Statement
-------------------------


But the stock's market attention quickly turned to the Federal Reserve policy statement, which was released at 2 p.m. ET. Headed into Wednesday, committee members envisioned two more rate hikes this year. Now, [the Fed expects zero rate hikes in 2019](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-dow-jones-fed-rate-hike-quantitative-tightening/), which is in line with what fed funds futures traders have been saying for a while. Now, the Fed expects just one rate hike in 2020. Just recently, traders saw about a 33% chance of a rate cut within one year.

The Federal Reserve also said that quantitative tightening — the shrinking of the Fed balance sheet as Treasury and mortgage securities mature — will conclude at the end of September.


Just ahead of the Federal Reserve statement, the 10-year Treasury yield was down 2 basis points to around 2.60%. As of 5 p.m. ET, it was trading around 2.52%, its lowest level since January 2018. Dow stocks **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) didn't like falling interest rates. Goldman slumped 3.4%, while JPMorgan gave back 2.1%.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq eked out a gain of less than 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrials lost 0.5%, and the S&P 500 eased 0.3%. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE vs. Tuesday. The Nasdaq avoided a second straight stalling session with a close in the upper half of the day's price range, but the S&P 500 added another [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


The Nasdaq marked a stalling session Tuesday when a 0.7% gain faded to 0.1% by the close. Volume rose.


So why did the stock market fade badly despite another market-friendly Fed statement? Keep in mind that the stock market has been showing some mild signs of distribution, or institutional selling.


With several distribution days now for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, it might seem like a market under distribution, but it's been mild distribution up to this point as indexes continue to hold above key price levels. Still, an elevated distribution-day count can't be completely ignored. Wednesday's session was just another example of what mild distribution looks like.


Two FANG Stocks Show Strength
-----------------------------


But two FANG stocks have been getting their house in order. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose for the seventh time in eight sessions. It's still inside the 5% buy zone of a 1,736.51 entry after clearing a flat base inside a larger base. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), meanwhile, topped a 371.59 handle entry in higher but not impressive volume.


Crude Oil Pops
--------------


Crude oil continued its assault on the $60 a barrel level after the Energy Information Administration reported a 10 million-barrel drop in U.S. crude supplies. After hitting a high of $60.12 a barrel, U.S. crude oil futures for April delivery settled at $59.83, up 1.4%.


Oil and gas-related industry groups were among the day's best performers. The U.S. exploration and production group outperformed, rising around 3%. Bullish charts in the group are hard to find, but large-cap **Cabot Oil & Gas** ([COG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COG)) fits the bill. Shares rose 1.7%, ending the session just above a 26.22 cup-with-handle buy point.

Among oil drillers, **Apergy** ([APY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APY)) is carving a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base with a 43.47 entry. Shares rose 1.8% to 42.52.


No doubt it's getting tougher to find actionable charts in IBD growth screens. That stands to reason because the stock market has been running higher for a while now. The true market leaders started moving weeks ago. Be careful not to buy third- or fourth-tier stocks in a group just because they could be poised to break out.


FedEx, Tencent Music Earnings
-----------------------------


Earnings reports from **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **Tencent Music** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)) didn't stir much excitement. Shares of FedEx slumped 3.5% after earnings and revenue missed expectations. The company also cut its full-year guidance, citing "weaker global trade growth trends."


Meanwhile, soaring licensing and content production costs fueled a 10% decline in shares of Tencent Music. The company's second straight quarter of decelerating earnings and sales growth didn't help matters. Headed into the report, Tencent Music was extended in price after a breakout from an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).

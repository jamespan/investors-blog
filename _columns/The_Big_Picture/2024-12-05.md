  Small Caps Lead Stock Market Lower As Jobs Report Looms

Small caps led the stock market lower Thursday, ending at session lows and pausing as Wall Street braced for Friday's [November jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-nov-bls-adp-federal-reserve-rate-cut-outlook-sp-500/).


The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 0.6%, while the S&P 500 dipped nearly 0.2%, as did the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite. But small caps sharply underperformed as the Russell 2000 index lost 1.3%.




Volume fell on the Nasdaq, and was slightly higher on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session. But the S&P 500 failed to fall at least 0.2%, so it narrowly avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/). Indexes still have few distribution days over the past five weeks.


Six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with materials, industrials and health care lagging the most. The consumer discretionary, consumer staples and energy were the best sectors of the day.


Due out early Friday morning, the Labor Department's employment report is expected to show that the U.S. economy added 200,000 jobs in November, up from October's 12,000 increase. The unemployment rate is expected to tick higher to 4.2%, from 4.1%, per Econoday estimates.

What Investors Should Do Now
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MP120524-238x300.jpg)


As the major stock indexes continue to hit new highs, IBD maintains its recommended exposure level at 80%-100%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are getting a bit extended from their 50-day line, but that's not a huge concern at the moment.


The S&P 500 is 3.6% above the 50-day moving average, and the Nasdaq is 5.5% above its 50-day line.


As the stock market treks higher, the environment continues to require diligent [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), one of the [four pillars of The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). Make sure you monitor your positions that are acting out of character and sell any stocks that trigger sell rules.


[IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) Breaking Out Today list featured one new stock: **Icici Bank** ([IBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBN)), which broke out past a 31.60 cup-with-handle buy point. The Near Pivot list has seven stock ideas on it, and one is **Trip.com** ([TCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCOM)), which is approaching a 69.67 buy point.

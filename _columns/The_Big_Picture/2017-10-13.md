U.S. stock indexes took some baby steps Friday, but the Philadelphia semiconductor index swaggered to a new high for the seventh session in a row.




The Nasdaq added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 0.1%.


Volume fell on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


The Sox, the nickname of the Philadelphia chip index, popped 0.7%. Within the Sox, the day's top gainers included chip designer **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), up 1.9%; chip equipment maker **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), up 1.6%; and chipmaker **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), up 1.5%.

Chip designer **Maxim Integrated Products** ([MXIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXIM)) is just under a 49.80 buy point. Another chip designer, **Cavium** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)), is just shy of a 70.18 buy point in a handle.


The chip sector has been the most consistently strong sector this year. Chips began 2017 in the top three among 33 sectors and have stayed in the top three most of the year.


Location within the three chip groups, however, has mattered.


The chip-designer group is up 19% for the year, and chipmakers are up 22%. But chip-equipment makers are up 56% for the year.


In the rally that began with the Aug. 21 lows, the chip-equipment group is up 24% vs. 14% for chip designers and 12% for chipmakers.


Are there any chip stocks left to buy?



Possibilities include chip-equipment maker **Cabot Microelectronics** ([CCMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCMP)), which is in its 5% buy zone; and **KLA Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), which is in the buy zone from a 101.85 buy point in a double-bottom base. It's also forming a handle now.


Breakouts were hard to come by Friday. If the IBD-style investor is sticking to the rules, the lack of breakouts in strong volume is saying something important: Be cautious. Indexes have had a tendency to stay only a few weeks around new highs.


Caution in the market seems to have displaced a more aggressive tone of only a few weeks ago. The small-cap Russell 2000 surged about 11% from its Aug. 21 low to Oct. 3. Since then, the Russell is flat, while 3% gains each in the Sox and the Dow Jones utility average lead the indexes.


In economic news Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge jumped to 101.1, a 13-year high.

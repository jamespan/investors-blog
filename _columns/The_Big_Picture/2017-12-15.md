U.S. stock indexes dashed ahead, as confidence surrounding the Republican tax-cut bill grew. The small cap Russell 2000 jumped 1.6% to lead the pack.




 The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average delivered stair-step gains of 1.2%, 0.9% and 0.6% respectively.


Volume rose across the board on expirations.


The Nasdaq's Nov. 9 distribution day fell off the count because of time. After five weeks, a day of distribution is no longer relevant to current conditions.


Meanwhile, Republicans made some final fixes to the tax-cut bill. The vote on the legislation is expected to come early next week.


Tax-Cut Bill
------------


For stock market investors, the bill's details are encouraging but not ideal. According to details leaked to the Los Angeles Times:


— The bill would slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. If this leads to more money being put to work, rather than hiding from taxes, then the economy should benefit.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MP121517-210x300.png)— The corporate repatriation rate would be 15% for firms bringing overseas profits back to the U.S. Here again, the money could find more active uses.


One detail not included in the leaked information is the proposed change in how capital gains are reported. Investors would be forced to record profits on a first in, first out basis. This could lead to a higher tax.


Broad Gains
-----------


Stocks found broad support. Gainers were found among quality stocks and among junk.


Of the 197 industry groups, every group in the top 40 rose, and 10 of the bottom dozen rose. Rising groups led falling groups by a 12-1 ratio.


Banks and retail led on the upside. Oil stocks lagged.


Intensity was missing, however, among quality stocks Friday. Breakouts were scarce and those that occurred were not top tier.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **PepsiCo** ([PEP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEP)), **Lockheed Martin** ([LMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LMT)) and **Graco** ([GGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GGG)) each broke out, but none have a three-year growth rate better than 12%.


Final Take On GDP
-----------------


Coming up: **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) will report quarterly results Tuesday. **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)) and **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) report Wednesday. **Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)) reports Thursday.


Economic news in the coming week will include several housing-related reports, but the big item comes Thursday. The final reading on Q3 GDP will be presented. The first reading was 3% and the second reading was 3.3%.

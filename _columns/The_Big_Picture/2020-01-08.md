  Stock Market Breathes Sigh Of Relief After Iran Strike; S&P 500, Nasdaq Hit New Highs

The stock market digested news of an overnight Iranian missile strike quite well Wednesday, with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 hitting record highs. But sellers came into the market late after several reports of loud explosions in Baghdad.




President Donald Trump addressed the nation late Wednesday morning and said no Americans were harmed after Iran fired several missiles at American targets in Iraq. Worries about a sustained U.S.-Iran conflict subsided, and that fueled a big drop in U.S. crude oil futures. Oil settled at $59.61 a barrel, down 4.9%. A surprise rise in weekly crude inventories also sparked selling.


The stock market breathed a sigh of relief on the Iran conflict, prompting another day of gains on Wall Street. The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 0.7%. The Dow Jones industrials added 0.6%, the S&P 500 picked up 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index rose 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq came in higher than Tuesday.


The Dow Jones performed well despite a 5.8% decline in **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)). Walgreens stock slumped after the drugstore chain reported disappointing earnings. **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) was a bright spot in the Dow ahead of a flurry of financial earnings reports next week. Amex stock rallied nearly 2% to 125.54 as it flirts with a breakout from a shallow [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) with a 126.43 buy point.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MP010820.jpg)The Dec. 2 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 fell off the count due to time, lowering the index's count to two. With a light distribution-day count for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq — and the stock market still in a confirmed uptrend — it makes sense to stay on offense. But be very discerning with new buys. Keep your attention focused on the leaders in an industry group and look for alternate entries. It also might make sense to take partial profits in some nice winners.


ADP Private Payroll Data
------------------------


In economic news, the ADP private payroll report came in much better than expected, with private payrolls up 202,000. That was well above the consensus estimate of a 157,000 gain. November data was revised sharply higher to 124,000 from an initial reading of 67,000. Friday's jobs report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up 155,000 on the heels of a bullish employment report for November that showed nonfarm payrolls up 266,000.

In other news, **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) led an early rally in homebuilder stocks after reporting better-than-expected earnings and sales. Shares added 0.8%, but an early breakout over a trend line (found by connecting the stock's recent highs) fizzled. Separately, a base breakout for **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) over a 41.80 buy point looked good for a while, but gains faded.


In related news, **Trex** ([TREX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TREX)) broke out over a 93.73 buy point, rising 4% to 94.39. Trex makes wood-alternative decking, railing and fencing products for residential and commercial markets.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


**Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up 2% to 145.86. It's working on a solid base with a 146.76 buy point.



Another base-building stock performed well Wednesday: **Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)) shares jumped nearly 3% to 307.48. Anthem stock closed right at a 307.48 entry.


In the enterprise software space, **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) gained ground for the sixth straight session. It's still in buy range from a 280.05 buy point, but it's been a low-volume breakout so far. Group peer **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) tried to clear a 178.09 entry Tuesday, but volume never came into the stock. RingCentral stock topped the buy point again Wednesday in light turnover.


There's still plenty to like about the stock market rally as the risk-on trade continues to show staying power. Sure, there are a lot of extended stocks in the stock market. But there's no shortage of other stocks showing positive price action post-breakout.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is one. Take a look at its weekly chart: Vertex stock offers a perfect example of a what a successful first test of the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) should look like after a breakout.

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), meanwhile, is still vying for a breakout from a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 241.91 buy point. It's a riskier entry after a big move from an initial entry at 188.50 and a first test of its 10-week moving average in early December.


**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is holding just above a three-weeks-tight entry of 234.60.

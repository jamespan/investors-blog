Banking Stocks Put On Running Cleats, REITs Fade As Major Indexes Rebound

Stocks advanced in fine form Wednesday as the bulls in tech, banking and select consumer-related stocks left their interest rate-sensitive peers eating their dust. Oil stocks also rallied hard on the back of a 2% jump in crude oil prices.


The Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrials both rallied 0.5% to 0.6% to halt a mild two-day losing streak. Volume grew.


The S&P 500 lagged by a couple steps, up 0.4%. Small caps slightly outperformed; the S&P SmallCap 600 gained 0.6%, the Russell 2000 0.7%.


It may seem odd that the Nasdaq and the Dow virtually equaled their gains. How could a bunch of mature, large and megacap blue chips keep up with all those younger, more vibrant high-growth companies in the technology-rich Nasdaq? In a nutshell, it was the banks.

**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) led the Dow 30 components with the largest point gain, up 4.13 to 166.40. It and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) were two of five companies on the Dow to rise 1 point or more.


Yet while Goldman Sachs — which is focused on trading, investment banking and advisory services for large clients — struggles to break out of a long rut, JPMorgan has broken out of a cup-with-handle base at 66.58 and found support at the 50-day moving average. New breakout points have also emerged for **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) (cup with handle at 48.28), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) (cup with handle, 32.47) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) (long and deep cup with handle, 16.34).


True, none of these Wall Street giants are close to hitting all-time highs. But they've fashioned what IBD calls the bottoming base, a chart pattern that emerges after a severe decline — that sets up potential moves to 52-week highs.


The stock market, like America, is all about second chances. Turnarounds emerge as a company or an industry gets back on a nice path of rising revenues and profitability. No one industry or sector can lead the market up forever. Think of every market uptrend as a long relay race in which groups of stocks continue to pass the baton, helping the major indexes roll to new highs and confound the skeptics.


Deep-pocketed fund managers seem to be more convinced lately that interest rates will rise by the end of the year — but not in a way to derail the economy. That's good news for not only the banks, whose profit margins in interest rate-related products could expand, but also companies that invest for absolute returns, including insurance companies.


Despite Wednesday's broad gains, some income investors likely frowned.


**CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)), which once heralded as No. 1 in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) earlier this year, has both hands on the knees and is panting hard like an Olympic sprinter who just finished last in the finals. The data center operator and real estate investment trust slipped 3% to 72.15, finishing under its 200-day moving average for the first time since May of 2014.


A long-term holder might not care about such chart-related analysis. CoreSite has stable and growing funds from operations, and its dividend yield of 2.8% still tops that of the S&P 500. Over the long run, dividends do contribute a lot to shareholder return. However, looking for genuine signals that institutions are aggressively taking profits and acting on those will no doubt enhance one's capital gains.
Suppose an investor had bought shares as CoreSite cleared a shallow saucerlike pattern at 51.42 in September 2015, then sold as the stock sharply cut through its 10-week moving average near 83 in accelerating volume in July this year, a key sell signal. The resulting 60%-plus gain would be worth a lot of years' worth of cash dividends.


The Dow utility average, another benchmark of defensive dividend payers, fell 0.3%.


Looking at the broad technical picture of the market, there is still a lot to like — even though the bull run is still long in the tooth and the distribution-day count on the S&P 500 is still elevated. The Aug. 30 distribution day expired on time, leaving seven on the S&P 500.


Winners beat losers by more than a 2-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq, and nearly 3-to-2 on the NYSE. In a market uptrend, more stocks simply go up and down. Visually, this law of the market is captured quite nicely by the NYSE advance-decline line, which can be viewed inside the large S&P 500 chart available in the link to the General Market Indicators page at the end of this article.

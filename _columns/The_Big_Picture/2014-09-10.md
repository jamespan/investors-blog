Stocks rebounded in somewhat lopsided fashion Wednesday, but market leaders in general showed the muscle typically witnessed in a healthy uptrend.


The IBD 50 rose 0.4%.


The Nasdaq composite led the field, rising nearly 0.8% and staging a solid bounce from mild weakness at the open. Gains in key growth sectors including security software, biotech and computer networking benefited the tech-heavy index.


The S&P 500 lagged with a 0.4% gain. Small caps couldn't keep up with the Nasdaq as well. The S&P SmallCap 600 rebounded just 0.3%. Volume faded on the Nasdaq and rose mildly on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq almost recouped all of Tuesday's sharp losses. That day's 0.9% decline in sharply higher volume marked only the second day of distribution for the Nasdaq since the leading index posted a follow-through Aug. 13, marking a fresh uptrend.


Granted, Tuesday's distribution day was heavily influenced by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). On Wednesday, Apple showed resilience, rising 3% in nearly double average trade. Not only did it contribute heavily to the Nasdaq's outperformance vs. other broad indexes, it also kept its impressive uptrend alive. It's finding support at the critical 50-day moving average for the second time since early August.


Amid a relative lack of news around the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, a few names have lit up the market with good quarterly results.


NYSE-listed **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) soared 11% to new highs in huge volume, extending gains 15% past an 85.88 entry. The firewall software firm's July-quarter earnings per share grew 43% on a 59% leap in sales.


In IBD [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), 10 stocks gained 1% or more, outrunning the general market.


From the vantage point of the weekly Investors Intelligence survey, bearishness remains extremely low at 14.1%. (See Page B11.) Yet low bearishness in this survey hasn't served as a reliable indicator of market peaks. Instead, let the day-to-day action of the major indexes and the performance of stocks in your portfolio serve as your gauge.


Strictly adhere to the golden rule of selling. (Read more in today's Investor's Corner on B4.) And be wary of thinly traded stocks. Make sure you're not buying too many that trade less than 400,000 shares a day.

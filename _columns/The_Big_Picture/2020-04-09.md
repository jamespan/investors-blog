Stock Market Extends Gains, But Growth Stocks Sit Rally Out Again; Russell 2000 Surges
=======================================================================================

Sellers came into the stock market Thursday afternoon, but major stock indexes found their footing by the close, capping a shortened week of trading with more gains. Once again, though, growth investors on the hunt for high-quality stocks breaking out of bases were left largely disappointed.




**Qualys** ([QLYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLYS)) was an exception in the security software group. The stock followed through powerfully after Wednesday's breakout from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). But it's now past the 5% buy zone from the 94.82 buy point.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished Thursday with a 1.2% gain. For the week, it soared 12.7%. The S&P 500 rallied 1.4% Thursday, and the Nasdaq composite picked up 0.8%. Intraday gains for the Dow Jones and S&P 500 hit 2.5%. The Nasdaq rose as much as 1.7%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP040919-274x300.jpg)**The Russell 2000 small-cap index surged 4.6% for the second straight session. It vaulted 18.5% for the week. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq rose from Wednesday's levels.**


**The stock market was in a good mood early after the Federal Reserve said it would provide up to $2.3 trillion in loans to businesses to support the economy. But an additional $250 billion in small business aid is still tied up in the Senate.**


**U.S. crude oil futures were volatile. After soaring 12% early on news of an output cut, oil reversed lower after details of the cut were slow to emerge. Oil futures settled at $22.76 a barrel, down 9.3%. Late Thursday, reports said a group of major oil producing countries confirmed a cut of 10 million barrels a day.**

Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Stock market bulls hoping for continued strength in [semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) weren't happy to see the Philadelphia Semiconductor index reverse sharply lower after hitting resistance at the 50-day moving average. The index lost 2.3%. Two semiconductor stocks with leadership potential — **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) — also reversed lower.


A similar theme played out Thursday as industry groups beaten down the most during the coronavirus stock market crash were among the day's best performers. IBD's airline group soared 25% for the week, while the hotel group surged more than 30%.


Top-rated growth stocks once again had a hard time attracting buying demand. Inside the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith), top-rated growth stocks like **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)), **Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)) and **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) ended with losses ranging from 3.7% to 7.3%.



That growth stocks aren't working yet isn't necessarily a bad sign for the confirmed uptrend. That's because it can take several weeks for the big leaders to emerge. Stay patient and avoid the pitfall of buying subpar stocks. If the confirmed uptrend shows staying power, bullish setups will emerge.


For now, top stocks like **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) and Leaderboard stock **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) still have potential to be stock market leaders.

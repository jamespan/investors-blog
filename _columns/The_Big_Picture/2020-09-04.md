The stock market endured another day of selling Friday, but the Nasdaq composite rallied furiously off lows after a visit to its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq's price action was a win for the bulls. There were several bright spots, but growth stocks sold off sharply again with several stock market leaders flashing key sell signals.




The Nasdaq ended near the day's high, paring a 5.1% morning loss to 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% and the S&P 500 lost 0.8%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq volume fell slightly from Thursday's levels ahead of the three-day weekend.


There wasn't much fear in the stock market Thursday as the put/call volume ratio registered a tame reading of 0.72 despite heavy losses. The ratio rose to 0.82 Friday.


The stock market remains in a confirmed uptrend. The outlook was in question when the Nasdaq broke sharply below its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) Friday, but the index closed strongly.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell sharply below its 50-day moving average but also rallied off lows. It fell 2.2%, weighed down by another sell-off in [software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/). IBD's enterprise group fell nearly 4%, ending with a weekly loss of more than 6%. Three enterprise software stocks in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) — **Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)) — ended with losses of 6% to 11.5%. Workday fell the most, but it's still holding above a 200.10 buy point.

On the NYSE and Nasdaq, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by less than 2-to-1.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Sell signals were plentiful in the stock market Friday, but several top stocks showed bullish action, including **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Tesla made a bullish stand at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), helped in part by rumors it could be added to the S&P 500 soon. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) also found support at their 21-day lines.


Amazon fell 2.2% but rallied nicely off its 50-day moving average. **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) found support at their 50-day lines.


Meanwhile, volatile weekly price action for **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) and Nvidia marked character changes, but all three stocks ended the week above their 10-week moving averages.


**Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) and **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) flashed sell signals with decisive closes below their 10-week lines.


If you're still holding some winners after the two-day sell-off, they should be holding above key support levels like the 21-day line or the 50-day moving average. Consider trimming or selling outright if any of your holdings break with conviction below these support levels.


Several top-rated stocks still holding up above buy points include **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) (though both erased sizable gain from buy points) as well as [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stocks **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)).

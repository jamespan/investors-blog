Major stock indexes showed mixed action Thursday, but top-rated stocks featured some aggressive leaps.

  

The Nasdaq pushed to a 0.4% gain, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average trimmed about 0.1% each.

  

The IBD 50 outperformed with a 0.8% pop.

  

Volume rose on both major exchanges.

  

The leaders delivered decisively positive action Thursday, including a number of gap-ups.

  

A gap-up involves a gain in which the stock opens above the previous day's high and stays above that level the whole day. It is [an exceptionally bullish move](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/600199-how-to-invest-when-stock-jumps.htm?ntt=Paul+Whitfield+gap+up+Investor%27s+Corner), and one of the few instances (when it happens on a breakout) where IBD recommends buying a stock beyond the standard 5% buy zone.

  

Stocks gapping up Thursday in furious volume included chip designer **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), customer management software maker **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Universal Insurance** ([UVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UVE)), generic and branded-drug maker **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) and computer networking components maker **QLogic** ([QLGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLGC)).

  

Economic news was mixed.

  

First-time jobless claims came in at 313,000 — above the consensus and the highest estimate. Durable goods for January were better than expected, but ex-transportation the number was weaker than estimated. The Kansas City Fed's manufacturing index for February missed views and was below the lowest estimate.

  

On the plus side, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's house price index for December was stronger than expected. Rising home prices can encourage construction, but homebuilding stocks didn't react much to the news.

  

On Friday, the second take on fourth quarter GDP growth will be released before the opening bell. The consensus view calls for 2.1% growth, which would be a downward revision from 2.6% in the first estimate.

  

Meanwhile, crude oil prices continued their volatile action. West Texas intermediate crude oil fell 4% to just under $49 a barrel. Brent fell less than 2% to under $61 a barrel.

  

Overall, the stock market action has been quiet so far this week. The indexes haven't suffered a distribution day — a sign of institutional selling — in about three weeks. But since the uptrend resumed Feb. 10, the indexes have notched a 1% gain only once — about two weeks ago.

Stock Market Hits Record Highs, But Gains Uneven As These Sectors Lag
======================================================================

The final week of 2020 began with stock market indexes making record highs, all but ensuring the Nasdaq composite will end 2020 with one of its five largest annual gains. But Monday's gains masked weakness in leading stocks and small caps.




Those are two of the strongest sectors in the stock market right now, and there could be some volatility as fund managers make year-end portfolio adjustments.


The Nasdaq added 0.7% and the S&P 500 rose 0.9%. But while both rose about the same, the two indexes acted differently. In the first hour of trading, the Nasdaq slid as much as 0.7% while the S&P 500 essentially held above its opening price of 3723.


MP122820Diverging Stock Market Behavior
---------------------------------------


The split partly reflected the market's differing behavior at the subsurface. Small caps weakened into the close, and many leading stocks got left out from the day's advance.


The Russell 2000 had been up as much as 1.1% but started slacking off from the opening bell. It reversed lower and eventually lost 0.4%. While a bearish reversal is never good, the small-cap index had just completed eight straight up weeks. Some cooling is to be expected, and modest declines will help keep the Russell 2000 from overextending itself.


The IBD 50 also reversed lower, ending with a loss of 0.8%. The growth-focused index doesn't boast nearly the same power of small caps in the past eight weeks. In fact, it is trying to beat a resistance level that has dogged the index since late August. In this case, a pullback wouldn't be a normal reaction as much as it would be a sign of continued resistance.


Of these 50 stocks, only nine closed higher. At the bottom of the pile, **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) tumbled 10.6% in a sharp break of its [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/). Volume increased 161% above its 50-day moving average. The top growth stock appeared to be gasping after a five-week run in which gains grew smaller almost each week and volume trended lower. Trade Desk fell more than 2% last week.


**Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) reversed lower to end with a loss of 5%. **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) slid more than 4%, though its current base is intact. **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)), the file-sharing service, made another bearish reversal and closed below the 24.24 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of last week's breakout. Many other IBD 50 stocks made bad reversals as well.


Stock Market Year End Moves?
----------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, also marking a new high. Volume surged on the Nasdaq and NYSE after a pre-Christmas half session Thursday.


The technology and consumer discretionary sectors led some late-day weakness. The tech sector is the heaviest influence on the Nasdaq, which helps explain why it underperformed the S&P 500 a bit.


Take away Monday's curious action and you still find the stock market behaving well. The [amount of distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) is moderate and sell signals are still scarce among the leading stocks, even with the IBD 50 struggling to make new highs.


A few breakouts Monday showed the market still has more to offer.



**Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)) broke out of a 19-week saucer base, and closed just below the 92.41 buy point. Volume more than doubled from its average. **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) topped the 159.08 buy point of a cup base. Volume was 32% above average.


Leaders such as **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)), **Logitech** ([LOGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGI))Â and **Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) are forming [new bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


The stock market opened higher after President Trump on Sunday signed a bill that he had blasted just last week, calling it inadequate. Faced with a possible government shutdown and pressure to provide Americans with some relief from the coronavirus economic slowdown, the president signed the bill. Trump still argues the bill contains too much wasteful spending.

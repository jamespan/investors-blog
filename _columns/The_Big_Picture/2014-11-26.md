Nasdaq Outperforms, Stocks Up In Quiet Pre-Holiday Trade
=========================================================

The Nasdaq scored a fifth straight gain Wednesday as leading stocks showed decent action ahead of Thanksgiving.


The composite index rose 0.6%, enriching its 1.8% advance collected over the prior four sessions.


The S&P 500 played second fiddle with a 0.3% gain. Income investors stayed hungry; the Dow utilities edged 0.5% higher.


Volume fell on both major exchanges.


Another selling spree in the oil sector made up some of Wednesday's gap in performance between the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The former is lagging the latter since Jan. 1 by more than 200 basis points.


As the U.S. dollar continues to firm up, commodities get roughed up. Flagging fortunes of the **United States Oil Fund** ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)), down 21% since Jan. 1 and off 29% from its June peak of 39.43, show how ETFs are not a fail-safe vehicle to accumulate wealth.


Big gains by IBD industry subgroups including chip manufacturing, chip designers and chip equipment companies no doubt contributed to the Nasdaq's fine day on what is usually a quiet session.


All three of the above groups, as well as biotechs, generic drugs and database software firms, ran more than 1% higher.


Friday trade overall should also be mild as it will be a half-day trading session, finishing at 1 p.m. ET.


The IBD 50 outperformed the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, up almost 1%. It's up 11.8% since Jan. 1.


Since the Oct. 15 low, IBD's list of premier growth stocks has bolted as much as 21% higher. That's an outstanding rebound after the market made one of its sharpest corrections of the year. So it's quite natural to see a number of leading growth stocks pause and form bases right now.


At the same time, the entire IBD 50 is producing plenty of bases and secondary buy points are emerging, even at the bottom of the list. That's bullish.


The market's technicals continue to be robust. The NYSE's advance-decline line continues to rise. Judging by the large number of retailers making IBD's new high list lately, investors seem to feel good about the holiday shopping season.


Stock-market bullishness is still high. The latest Investors Intelligence poll of newsletter editors currently shows that 56.5% are predicting a further advance. Just 13.8% believe the market will become a bear decline.


History has proved that bullishness can remain high for months before the market itself gives signs that a real correction is underway.

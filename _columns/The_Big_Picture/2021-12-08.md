Stock Market Extends Gains In Quiet Trade; When Can Investors Jump Back In?
============================================================================

The stock market climbed in quiet volume Wednesday, giving key market indexes a chance to digest the prior session's big gains.




Stocks started out higher as fears about the omicron Covid-19 variant continued to wane. Though they turned slightly negative midday, the indexes reversed higher to close with minor to modest gains, extending their advance for a third straight session.


The Nasdaq composite led with a 0.6% gain. On Tuesday, it regained its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and is now less than 3% below its Nov. 22 intraday high. The S&P 500 edged 0.4% higher to finish just shy of a new closing high. While it closed just above 4,700, the index has faced prior resistance at that level.


Meantime, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.1% gain for a third straight advance. The blue chip index sits about 2% away from its high.


So, when can investors jump back in?


Not just yet. The market is [still in a correction](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/action-plans/), so it's best to stay on the sidelines until one of the key indexes stages a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). Stay tuned, since that could occur this week.

Wednesday marked the third day of a stock market rally attempt on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.


Starting at Day 4 of the rally attempt, look for one of the indexes to rise sharply in higher volume than the prior day. That would indicate a follow-through day and signal the start of a potential uptrend.


On Wednesday, both major exchanges saw lighter volume, which indicates institutional investors are not yet buying aggressively. Volume has fallen each day so far this week.


Pfizer Delivers Omicron Update
------------------------------


Stocks started out higher as fears about the omicron variant continued to wane after **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) and partner **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) gave an update on their Covid-19 vaccine. They said a third dose of their vaccine neutralized the latest variant in lab tests.


But both stocks reversed lower after giving up early gains. Pfizer slipped slightly below a 51.96 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of a cup base. BioNTech is testing its 50-day moving average and is 37% off its Aug. 10 high.


The stocks' action isn't too surprising, given the market is still in correction. Some stocks might stage a successful rally, but more reversals are likely to occur until the market is back in a confirmed uptrend.


For instance, **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) broke out past an 81.97 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) on Tuesday, then added to its gains Wednesday. It's now extended from the entry.


But **Zim Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) cleared a 60.19 buy point of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) early Wednesday. It ended up erasing all its gains and then some by the close, like Pfizer and BioNTech.


That's why it's important for investors to stay defensive. It's a good time to update watchlists, so investors are ready to move when a follow-through day occurs.


Leaders Up In Big Volume
------------------------


And several leading stocks are showing positive action.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) led the Dow Jones with a 2.3% gain to mark a second straight new high in heavy trade. The stock is extended past a 153.27 cup-with-handle entry. An appeals court froze enforcement of an injunction that would have forced Apple to allow external payment options on its App Store by Thursday, MarketWatch reported.


**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) surged nearly 18% to gap above its 50-day line after S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company will be added to the S&P 500 index effective Tuesday. A breakout in October had failed.


**Kulicke & Soffa** ([KLIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLIC)) rallied 4.5% in busy trade to extend Tuesday's 11% surge. Shares are now about 10% away from a 75.39 buy point of a cup pattern.

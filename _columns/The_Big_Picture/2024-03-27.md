Did the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) show two sides of its ever-mysterious, multifaceted personality?




Whether you're wet behind the ears in the stock market or a battle-tested veteran, you likely find the final days of each calendar quarter fascinating.


If the day was up, was it energetic window-dressing by portfolio managers? If the day was down, did the savviest players on Wall Street take a lot of chips off the table?


Of course, nobody will ever know. In a blind auction, that's the point. Therefore, individual investors and advisors must continue to simply read the facts presented by the stock market each and every day, then draw as objective a conclusion as possible.


Judging by Wednesday's move, it seemed like some folks on the Street desired to take profits. And yet others took the mild morning weakness in certain areas of the market as an opportunity to grab shares.


Stock Market Today
------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP032724-215x300.jpg)Small caps won the daily performance race. A 2.1% surge by the Russell 2000 more than doubled the S&P 500's 0.9% rise and more than quadrupled the Nasdaq composite's 0.5% gain. The Nasdaq 100, comprised of the 100 largest nonfinancial firms on that exchange, edged 0.3% higher. The S&P made a record closing high.


As further indication of the search for growth beyond what has quickly become a dusty moniker, the Magnificent Seven, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also outperformed. It rallied 1.2%. The Dow Jones transportation average climbed 1.1% despite worries about the threat to shipping and trucking routes caused by the horrific Francis Scott Key Bridge catastrophe off the shores of Baltimore.


Bullish ratios of winners vs. losers reaffirmed the day's strength among various indexes. On the Nasdaq, winners led by a nearly 3-1 ratio, while over on the NYSE, rising issues outmatched decliners by almost 4-to-1.


On a more granular level, nearly three dozen of IBD's 197 industry groups pounded the major indexes with gains of 2% or more. Yet interestingly, only one of the 32 top performing industries came from technology: the semiconductor manufacturing group. Airline, coal, leisure products, Southwest banks, generic drug and metal ores firms did even better.

More Of An Even Keel In 2024
----------------------------


Volume shrank mildly on both main exchanges, ahead of the final day of the first quarter of 2024.


The Nasdaq, the clear leader in 2023's huge stock market rebound, is not so clear a leader among equity indexes today. Yet for the long investor, the confirmed market uptrend, while slowing in its pace, remains intact.

And that's remarkable, given the very large number of instances of pronounced profit-taking by institutional investors that still make IBD's 25-session count.


As the Market Pulse shows, despite Wednesday's nice up day, as many as [eight distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-timing-the-subtle-sign-of-market-tops/) remain. Yet keep in mind that you can have four different scenarios when it comes to determining what this means for the stock market going forward. Namely:


1. High quantity of distribution, severe intensity of selling in each bout of distribution
2. Low quantity of distribution, severe intensity
3. High quantity of distribution, moderate to mild intensity
4. Low quantity of distribution, moderate to mild intensity


What does the stock market reflect today? Perhaps Scenario No. 3. This means until we see deeper declines and bigger storm clouds in terms of other technicals, growth stock investors are likely to maintain solid positions in their best stocks.


This of course is unusual, but not without precedent.


During the early-to-mid 2010s, after the near total meltdown of Wall Street and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, Countrywide Financial and Wachovia during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the major indexes made a shaky recovery. Many confirmed uptrends got weighed down by multiple distribution days. Easy gains were hard to come by. Yet the Nasdaq and S&P 500 gradually kept hitting higher highs and higher lows. Market volatility finally calmed down in a major way during 2017.


If the Nasdaq summons the strength to reach the 16,700 level, one might expect the distribution count to diminish quickly.


Individual leadership in the stock market, however, is due for a rest.

A Short-Term Sell Rule
----------------------



Take **Celsius** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)), which in the past has already staged a 100-fold gain from its 2019 lows. The top investing play in the energy drink sector and [former Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) did not join Wednesday's rebound.


Instead, the midcap growth stock fell 8.5% to 83.43. Volume jumped only 24% above the stock's 50-day average. But Celsius also pierced its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) for the first time since its breakout past an early buy point of 62.05 within a six-month base.


Don't forget, too, that the [Investors Intelligence weekly survey](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) of market pundits remains far tilted toward heavy optimism. That, by itself, however, is not a primary sell signal.

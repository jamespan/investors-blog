Small-Cap Stocks, Nasdaq Spearhead Gains; Is The Fed's 'Game Of Governors' Hurting Investors?
==============================================================================================

Another day in early 2023, another day of Nasdaq outperformance. But give credit to the bullish movement in small-cap stocks as well.




The Nasdaq's 0.9% gain on Wednesday clearly outshined smaller advances of almost 0.3% by the S&P 500 and 0.1% by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. On the price-weighted Dow industrials, losing health care and medical names weighed. **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **UnitedHealth** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) joined three other blue chip components with losses of 1 point or more.


The only major benchmark to eclipse the Nasdaq's performance? The Russell 2000 lifted 1.1%. At 1960, the legion of small-cap stocks boosted its year-to-date gain to 11.1%.


Year-To-Date Update
-------------------


The Russell 2000's rally pales next to the Nasdaq's 15.3% rise since Jan. 1. The S&P 500 lags with an 8.3% gain, which is nonetheless quite healthy. It shriveled 19.4% last year, excluding dividends. Meanwhile, the Dow is up barely 3% year to date.


Yet another way to view the major indexes' performance? Consider this: Futures activity in the minutes before the 9:30 a.m. ET market bell indicated losses in the 0.6% range across the board.


And if you spy an intraday chart of the Nasdaq, you'll see the start was slippery.



After a gap down at the open, the composite index backtracked as much as 0.7% in the first 45 minutes of regular-session trade. But the intraday chart also highlights the Nasdaq ending the day at session highs. Volume finished roughly flat on Wednesday on both main exchanges.


Beyond Small-Cap Stocks
-----------------------


A hotter-than-expected report on January U.S. retail sales likely thumped premarket futures. A 3% jump in the headline number vs. December strengthened hope that the U.S. economy will avoid a hard landing. Yet it also affirms market participants' thinking that yes, the Federal Reserve will be even more adamant to use higher rates to bring inflation down to a comfortable level.


As the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) showed, even when excluding volatile food and energy components, retail sales still grew at a fast clip in January, up 2.6% vs. the consensus view of a 0.6% rise.


"Warm weather encouraged people to go out and spend after harsh conditions depressed activity in December," James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, wrote in a comment emailed to IBD. "Household incomes remain under pressure and with weather patterns (normalizing), a correction is likely in February."


Knightley added that the January report marked the fourth biggest month-on-month rise in U.S. retail sales over the past 20 years.


More Key Reports Coming
-----------------------


Additional key reports are just over the horizon. Watch for the market's treatment of weekly jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey on Thursday, plus the leading economic indicators index on Friday.


Going back to the market's behavior on Wednesday, you can see the same bullish action beyond large- and small-cap stocks, too. SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ETF ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) turned a lemon of a morning into a refreshing gain, squeezing a first-hour loss of 0.8% into a gain of nearly 0.7%.


So, for those investors intent on making profits on the long side, and not doubting the confirmed uptrend for now, this market refrain of weak start, strong finish bodes well.


Take a close look at the leaders up in volume portion of the accompanying Market Pulse. Not only do you see a lot more names making the table vs. leaders that fell in heavy turnover. You're seeing breakout attempts that are gaining traction.


**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), a 4.2% winner on Wednesday, is crossing an 11-month downtrend that began with the tech stock's 213.61 peak on April 20. The leader in multifaceted cybersecurity defense tools is leaving all of its key moving averages in the rearview mirror.



Watch for January-quarter results to arrive Feb. 21.


**InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) shares on Wednesday punished short sellers with a 10.3% gain in heavy turnover. That move raised the member of top small-cap stocks above a 40.39 entry point within a [three-month consolidation pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/).


The expert in radio frequency technology for skin aesthetic and other treatments [notched a 22% gain in Q4 earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/inmd-stock-inmode-earnings-q4-2022/) to 78 cents a share as sales rose 21% to $133.6 million.


Flexing Leadership
------------------


**Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) followed up on Tuesday's breakaway gap and gain of 7.2% with a 1.6% move to new highs. At 202.26, the large-cap design software firm for the chip and electronics markets has rushed 5.3% past a 192.02 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).



Could Cadence Design pull back and try to shake out newer investors? Surely. After all, the stock has surged more than 30% in the space of six weeks. You can always expect some traders on Wall Street to sell into this strength. In other words, expect pullbacks to occur, yanking stocks to, or even below, their [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).


However, the more stocks hold firmly above their bases and breakout points, the more confidence one can have in deploying capital into new emerging leaders.


Robert Maltbie, president of Las Vegas-based Singular Research, expressed optimism for small-cap stocks in 2023. One reason: Valuations are more attractive in this area vs. the biggest issues that lead the Nasdaq 100. "With the QQQs getting priced at around 28 times earnings, that's where the vulnerability is," he told IBD. "Small-cap stocks and micro caps also really line up to a new supercycle in commodities."



Take **Aehr Test Systems** ([AEHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEHR)), which is both a tech and energy play.


Maltbie notes that when he spotted the chip-equipment gear maker in IBD's key stock lists, trading around 16 or 17 a share last year, he saw practically zero coverage among the main firms on Wall Street. Shares now trade at 35, up 80% after three moves above the 19.53 buy point of a base within a larger structure. Aehr's products have found a niche within the electric vehicle market.

Beyond Small-Cap Stocks: The Fed's Game
---------------------------------------


Following the stronger-than-expected January CPI report on Tuesday, the expectation among futures traders tracked by the CME now shows a 52% probability that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates by a quarter point three more times through its June meeting. This means the fed funds rate, or the cost of overnight loans to Wall Street banks, could hit a peak of 5.25%-5.5% by early summer. That's the highest level since January 2001.


Maltbie criticizes the manner in which the Fed is using relatively old data to make judgments on how far interest rates should rise. For instance, some of the data the central bank looks at involves surveys of prices on apartment rentals across the country that take place every six months. Maltbie likens that to looking at the health of a stock on its chart by taking into account its 200-day moving average, but not its current price.


"I can virtually guarantee that the monthly CPI will come down the next three or four months. You can get data on rents from other data gatherers. And in the last four months they have been downward," he added. "Savvy fund managers are having their analysts adjust the numbers for both CPI and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) indexes."


Meanwhile, Maltbie thinks a desire among monetary policy hawks within the Fed to talk down the stock market amounts to a virtual "game of governors," alluding to the HBO Max megahit series, "Game of Thrones." Why? The Fed's mission is both to maximize full employment and economic growth while keeping inflation and prices stable. "Are they trying to add to the price stability?" Maltbie asked with a hint of irony.


Future Of The Yield Curve
-------------------------


He believes over time the yield curve will resume its normal shape. That is, the hawkish elements of the Fed will recede. Put another way, at some point we could see the 1-year Treasury note, which closed Wednesday at 4.96%, fall back to 3%. The 10-year bond yield, now at 3.81%, may rise to 4%. Finally, the 20-year bond, yielding 3.97%, could eventually return to 5%.

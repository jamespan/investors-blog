The stock market continued its healing Wednesday, when the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose for the third day in a row but the Dow Jones industrial average lagged.




The Nasdaq added 0.2% and the S&P 500 0.1%. The composite had been up as much as 0.5% before gains faded, especially in the final hour of trading.


More important was the fact that both indexes added some space above their 50-day moving averages. Those lines represented potential barriers for the market, and this week's gains past them should give investors a sense of reassurance.


The Dow fell 0.2%. The biggest percentage decliner was **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), which slid 7.5% despite beating profit expectations. Big Blue's drop accounted for a loss of 83 points on the Dow, which closed 38 points lower.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MP041818-258x300.jpg)Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Small caps outperformed slightly, with the Russell 2000 up 0.2% after it too surrendered some gains. The Dow transports raced 1.7% higher, with airline, ship, rail and airfreight stocks in the top 30 Wednesday out of 197 industry groups.


Transports rallied despite oil prices' climb to their highest levels since 2014. U.S. inventories fell while OPEC and Russia appear set to continue with their output cuts.


No sector had better and broader gains than energy. Exploration and production, oilfield services, drilling and other oil groups shined.


More than two weeks have passed since the market made [a follow-through to confirm a new uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-surge-tariff-relief-bullish-shift-market/), and progress remains satisfactory. There's been no distribution so far.


It was prudent to start getting back into stocks after that signal, since the follow-through lacked the vigor of similar signals in the past. The market itself has been moving on headlines, one of the factors that separates today's market from the remarkable advance of 2017.


Now, with indexes and leading stocks gathering momentum, the market is at a stage where it's good to increase exposure. To that end, study industries that have been displaying new leadership. Opportunities are emerging in those areas.

In defense and aerospace, **Textron** ([TXT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXT)) broke out of a base Wednesday in heavy volume. Textron [breezed past first-quarter earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/news/textron-stock-is-buy-strong-earnings-tool-unit-sale-to-emerson/) and also said it is selling its tool business to **Emerson Electric** ([EMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMR)).


**Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) topped the 75.65 buy point of a flat base in volume 28% above average. Missile maker **Raytheon** ([RTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTN)) broke out Monday from a flat base and remains in buy range above the 222.92 entry.


With oil prices trending higher, the energy sector is another to watch. More than a half dozen oil stocks topped buy points Wednesday, but many were in lackluster volume. Quite a few are recovering from protracted price corrections. So stock picking in this sector is more challenging.


But the solar energy group has risen to the top 10, and **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) shined Wednesday with a breakout in heavy volume. The relative strength line also made a new high, reinforcing the breakout. Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded First Solar to buy from neutral and raised the price target to 83 from 75, citing rising demand from China this year. The stock closed at 77.58.


A few cyclical stocks deserve attention. **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) surged past a cup-without-handle base in double its usual volume. The aluminum company's [earnings beat views](https://www.investors.com/news/alcoa-earnings-due-stock-hits-buy-zone/) late Wednesday. Rail operator **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)), which is also part of the transportation rally, cleared a base in triple its normal turnover.


Earnings season is growing in focus on Wall Street. It should be a big quarter again as the benefits of the tax cut work into results. FactSet researchers say the S&P 500's earnings per share are expected to grow 17.3% for the first quarter. Actual earnings have tended to be above estimates at the end of each quarter, and based on that FactSet believes S&P 500 EPS gains will be closer to 20%.


But as banks are showing, beating views doesn't guarantee stock gains. The market can punish companies that don't measure up to the Street's expectations.

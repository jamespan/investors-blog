The S&P 500 marked another all-time closing high Monday in an otherwise lackluster session.

  

Pre-market futures pointed toward a lower open on news that Greece's Parliament failed to elect a new president. Greek stocks slumped 4% on fears the anti-austerity party Syriza will emerge victorious in elections next month.

  

But the selling never intensified in U.S. markets. Major averages ended mixed and mostly unchanged. The S&P 500 added 0.1%, the Dow eased 0.1% and the Nasdaq was flat. NYSE and Nasdaq volume rose from Friday's levels but remained well below average.

  

With volume so light, it's not easy for bulls to open new positions with confidence. But it's not easy for the bears to go short with confidence either.

  

What's known right now is that the market uptrend is up until proven otherwise. IBD's market outlook shifted to a more positive stance last week thanks to a fresh all-time high for the S&P 500. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 joined the new-high party Friday with new highs of their own.

  

Still, multiple distribution days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 earlier in the month can't be ignored. Neither can sluggish action in several recent breakouts.

  

Recent low-volume breakouts from the likes of **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) and **NetSuite** ([N](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=N))have stalled, while other breakouts from **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) haven't gone anywhere. If institutional money were flowing in from the sidelines with conviction, breakouts generally wouldn't be struggling like they are.

  

Utility stocks have been outperforming lately and it was more of the same Monday as four of the day's top-10 performers hailed from the sector. Market bulls can't be all that excited to see money flow into utilities. Strength in utilities is generally a sign of a nervous, defensive market.

  

Still, gas distributor **AGL Resources** ([GAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GAS)) cleared a flat base with a buy point of 55.69. Volume was higher than Friday but still well below average.

  

Meanwhile, some of the day's worst-10 performing industry groups were top-rated groups in IBD's database.

  

The Computer Software-Security group, the No. 1-ranked group in IBD's database headed into Monday, slumped more than 2%. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) weighed on the group, dropping nearly 4% in average volume. Those with a big profit cushion could wait and see how the stock behaves around its 50-day moving average, currently around 113.

Stock indexes showed little concern Thursday over the background noise that tariffs and [the yield curve](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-treasury-bond-yield-curve-stocks/) have been creating for months. Elite stocks were mostly up.




The Nasdaq posted a 1.2% gain, while the small-cap S&P 600 followed with 0.9%. The S&P 500 added 0.5%. The Dow was just under flat.


Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.


The action was good enough to improve the market's condition to resumed uptrend, despite fresh threats on trade. The change means investors can raise their exposure by buying more breakouts or adding shares when stocks reach secondary entries.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MP080218-207x300.jpg)President Trump threatened to increase tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. The stock market shrugged and went about its business.


It's possible that the market has grown weary of fretting over the same situation day after day.


If that's the case, then the market has shifted into the Cal Coolidge zone. "If you see 10 troubles coming down the road, you can be sure that nine will run into the ditch before they reach you," the former president reportedly said.


A good gauge for judging calm in the stock market is the performance of stocks that carry a best possible 99 Composite Rating.


If the elite stocks are keeping their composure, shouldn't investors chill out as well?


The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 99 means the stock is in the top 1%.


Twenty-two stocks hold a 99 rating and are not thinly traded.


On Thursday, only two of the 22 fell, according to preliminary data.


May initial public offering **CLPS** ([CLPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLPS)) fell 6% in soft volume. The China-based financial services provider's three year earnings and revenue growth rates are 31% and 28%, respectively.


Textbook printer **Chegg** ([CHGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHGG)) sagged 1.1% in moderately higher volume. The California-headquartered company recently beat the Street's earnings estimate by 50%.

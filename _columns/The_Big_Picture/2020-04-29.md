Buyers stormed back into the stock market Wednesday, helped by a flurry of positive headlines and a Federal Reserve statement that said it will do anything it takes to support a U.S. economy in dire straits.




Futures pointed toward a strong open after Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) reported better than expected sales. And the stock market strengthened further after **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) said a trial of its [coronavirus treatment remdesivir](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/coronavirus-treatment-gild-stock-halted-positive-test-results/) met a primary goal.


The two-day Federal Reserve meeting concluded Wednesday, and the [Fed pledged to keep interest rates near zero](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-wall-street-expects-yield-curve-control/). Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also said the economy will likely need more stimulus to ensure a healthy recovery. Last month, the Fed slashed interest rates close to zero in two steps, launched unlimited quantitative easing, and bought more than $2.4 trillion in assets, mostly Treasuries and mortgage securities.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MP042920-237x300.jpg)In Tuesday's stock market, small caps continued their recent string of outperformance, with the Russell 2000 up 5.4%. The index was the first to confirm a new uptrend on March 24 when it soared 9.4% in higher volume. The [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) occurred on the fourth day of the rally attempt. But IBD did not change its market outlook to Confirmed Uptrend until the S&P 500 made a follow-through April 2.


Chip Stocks Ramp Higher
-----------------------


The Nasdaq composite continued its march toward the 9000 level after a temporary setback Tuesday that saw leading growth stocks come under serious selling pressure. The Nasdaq jumped 3.6% Wednesday, helped by a rally in semiconductor stocks. Top gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)), **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)), **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)). But they haven't provided much leadership lately.


The chip sector is home to plenty of top performers, including [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stocks **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). AMD shares lagged Wednesday after the company reported earnings and gave lukewarm sales guidance. But [AMD reported its second-straight quarter of stellar growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-earnings-q1-2020-amd-stock/). Adjusted profit soared 200% year over year, with revenue up 40% to $1.79 billion. It's holding support at its 21-day moving average but well below a 58.73 buy point.


Meanwhile, after a breakout over a 275.50 buy point, Nvidia is still trying to clear an alternate handle entry of 299.10.



The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed closer to the 25,000 level, rising 2.2%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, drew closer to the 3000 level, rising 2.7%. Nasdaq volume rose, and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Tuesday.


After the close, strong earnings reports from **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), helped lift Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) to an after-hours gain of more than 1.5%.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) added 2.8%, helped by strong moves for **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) and **SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)). SolarEdge surged 11.5%, helping lift IBD's solar group to a gain of around 10%. **Enphase** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) is also performing well in the group. Shares surged nearly 14%.


Stock Market Faces Near-Term Test
---------------------------------


Higher-volume declines for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 Tuesday resulted in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for each index, but clearly it's not a stock market under distribution. Before Tuesday, the only other distribution day for the Nasdaq was on April 7, one day after the Nasdaq made its own follow-through signal. But that distribution day fell off the count because the index rallied more than 5% from its April 7 closing price.


Indeed, some technical indicators are pointing toward an overbought market. And with indexes approaching round numbers (25,000 for the Dow, 9000 for the Nasdaq and 3000 for the S&P 500), a pullback could be in the cards. Round numbers can often be resistance levels for indexes and individual stocks.

But with a low distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, and leading growth stocks still acting well, there's still plenty to like about the stock market rally.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Several leading growth stocks still have bullish charts and are breakout candidates. **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) rebounded smartly after Tuesday's 4.3% haircut. Shares jumped 4.7% to 349.17. It's forming a cup-with-handle base with a 350.48 buy point. **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) rebounded 6.4% after falling 3.4% Tuesday. It's [near the top of a cup base](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/paypal-stock-claws-back-as-e-commerce-resilient-amid-coronavirus/) with a 124.55 entry. And **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) surged 6% after shedding nearly 3% Tuesday. The software firm is still in buy range from a 182.10 buy point.


Stocks with high [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) near buy points include **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Mercury Systems** ([MRCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRCY)), **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) and **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)).

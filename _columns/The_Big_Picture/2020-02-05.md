Dow Jones Jumps 1.7% As UnitedHealth Flashes Buy Signal; Tesla Takes A Hit
===========================================================================

A 1.1% early gain for the Nasdaq composite Wednesday faded by the close, hurt by a sell-off in software stocks and a 17% drop in **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock. But it was a decidedly bullish session for the Dow Jones industrials and Russell 2000 small-cap index, and the S&P 500 marked a record closing high.




Four of the day's worst performing industry groups hailed from the software sector, but a strong rally in [semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) buoyed the Nasdaq. The composite erased a 1.1% intraday gain but ended higher by 0.4%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.7%, the S&P 500 picked up 1.1% to a record closing high, and the Russell 2000 gained 1.5%. Nasdaq volume rose 1%, while preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.

The Dec. 30 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) for the S&P 500 fell off the count Wednesday because enough time has passed to make it irrelevant.


Sellers finally came into Tesla after a huge run-up, but those who bought at the 361.30 buy point when the stock broke out in December can still afford to sit tight. Tesla closed Wednesday 12% above its 10-day moving average, 59% above its 50-day line and 145% above its 200-day line. All those are possible exit points for investors. Another line in the sand is Tesla's 21-day moving average, currently around 600. Sentiment was negative in Tesla after the company said February Model 3 deliveries in China would be delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak. A Cannacord Genuity analyst downgraded Tesla.


Dow Jones Winners
-----------------


**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) led the Dow Jones industrials.


UnitedHealth gapped above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/), helped by strong earnings from group peer **Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)). Humana also gapped above its 50-day line as did **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)), which reported earnings on Tuesday.


IBM stretched its winning streak to four sessions. Shares jumped another 4.8% to 156.33 after topping a 145.89 buy point Monday. It's been a powerful breakout so far, helped by news that Arvind Krishna will take over the CEO post in April, replacing Ginni Rometty. Krishna currently leads IBM's cloud-computing business.


**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) was another solid gainer in the Dow Jones Wednesday, up 4.6%. After falling in 10 out of the past 11 sessions, U.S. crude oil futures rallied 2.3% to $50.75 a barrel.


Chip Stocks Buoy Nasdaq
-----------------------


After giving up support at its 50-day moving average Friday, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) rallied for the third straight session, up 2%. Several chip stocks outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, including **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)), **Texas Instruments** ([TXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXN)) and **Analog Devices** ([ADI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADI)).


**Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) edged lower in after-hours trading after [reporting earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/qualcomm-earnings-q1-2020-qcom-stock/). The chip bellwether is still trading near a 90.56 buy point.

But iShares Expanded Tech Software ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)) gave back 1.5%. IBD's enterprise software industry group was one of the day's worst performers, down 2.8%, weighed down by weakness in **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) and **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)), which reported earnings.


**Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), one of several leaders in the enterprise software group, slumped 7% in late trading after reporting earnings and [issuing weak sales guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paycom-earnings-payc-stock-q42019/).


Bullish Economic Data
---------------------


ADP data that showed private payrolls increased 291,000 in January, well above expectations of 154,000, also encouraged the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The data comes ahead of Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up 158,000. The unemployment rate is currently at 3.5%.


In other news, stock market bulls liked the latest Investors Intelligence survey of market newsletter writers, which showed another precipitous drop in bullish sentiment. That's actually good news for the bulls because it's a contrarian indicator. Two weeks ago, bullish sentiment was nearing extreme levels at 59.4%. Last week, it fell to 52.8%. This week, it's at 47.6%.


According to Investors Intelligence, readings above 55% calls for defensive measures — tight stops at a minimum and trimming big winners. Bulls above 60% signal more danger, and the need to prepare for a market decline.


In other stock market news, software giant **Cerner** ([CERN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CERN)) broke out over a 76.42 buy point, fueled by strong earnings. Shares jumped nearly 6% to 78.59.

In the retail sector, **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) extended gains after reclaiming its 50-day moving average Tuesday. Support at the 50-day line creates an [alternate buy zone](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/burlington-stores-stock-buy-point-ross-stores-tjx-costco/) after a powerful breakout from a flat base in late November.


**LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) cleared a well-formed [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), rising nearly 7% to 86.84. It's still in the 5% buy zone from the 83.78 buy point.

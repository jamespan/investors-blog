Techs Fall But These Stock Market Signals Offer Positive Tone
==============================================================

It was a lousy Friday for internet and technology stocks, which left the technology-rich Nasdaq composite hobbled. But the rest of the stock market showed little change, indicating the damage was contained.




The Nasdaq fell 0.8% even after reducing some losses. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which gave the composite the first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) of the new stock market uptrend. The main indexes went five days since the Oct. 14 [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-powers-up-these-four-top-growth-stocks-in-or-near-buy-zones/) without even a hint of distribution, until Friday.


The sell-off in social media and related internet stocks was too much to overcome. **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) triggered the selling with [disappointing Q3 sales and a weak outlook](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-how-will-it-react-to-earnings/). The parent of Snapchat plummeted nearly 27%, its largest drop ever, as volume grew to nearly 10 times its average.


Snap said Apple's new privacy rules hurt its ability to target users. Also, labor shortages and supply-chain difficulties hindered some advertisers. The news sent a chill across the industry.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MP102221-260x300.jpg)Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) slid 5% in heavy volume and closed near the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). It was the third-worst performer on the S&P 500 today, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) fell close to 5%. **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) fell 3%. Both closed below their [50-day moving averages.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/)


Alphabet's volume in class A and class C shares plus Facebook's volume accounted for a chunk of the higher Nasdaq volume.


S&P 500 Falls Slightly
----------------------


But the S&P 500 sidestepped most of the damage. It thinned a 0.6% morning loss to just 0.1% at the close. The index managed to make a record high for the second straight day. It held above the 15,000 level.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2%, also notching a new high.


**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) nearly single-handedly kept the Dow positive with a 4% gain. It was the biggest contributor to the Dow's gain, according to Dow Jones Markets Data. American Express solidified a move above the 178.90 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The credit card company beat profit expectations early Friday, citing a recovery in the restaurant industry.


Its move helped compensate for **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), which plunged nearly 12% after the chipmaker's [sales and forecast disappointed Wall Street](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-stock-chipmaker-crushes-third-quarter-targets-but-stock-falls/).


Stock Market Remains In Uptrend
-------------------------------


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 made it three straight weekly gains. In the past week, the Nasdaq added 1.3% and the S&P 500 rose nearly 1.7%. For the month of October, the Nasdaq is up 4.4% and the S&P 500 up 5.5%.


Friday's distribution day was a stumble for the stock market, but nothing to throw it off its new uptrend.



After a solid initial move from the follow-through, the stock market could use a breather. After all, it is in the middle of earnings season. All the while, supply chain problems and rising costs are persistent headwinds. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday [he is more concerned about supply bottlenecks and inflation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-chairman-jerome-powell-says-supply-side-constraints-are-creating-more-inflation-risk-11634917630?mod=hp_lead_pos11).


The IBD 50 slid 0.9% due partly to Snap's collapse but still rose 1.3% for the week. It's above the 50-day moving average as well.


Much of Friday's drop in the IBD 50 owed to some of its most volatile stocks. **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) fell 3.5%. **Dynavax Technologies** ([DVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVAX)) fell less than 4% after paring losses.

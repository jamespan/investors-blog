Stock Market Sees More Rotation, And This Time Small Caps And Cyclicals Get Rocked
===================================================================================

The rotation in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) continued. But this time, investors fled small caps and headed back into safe-haven Treasury bonds on the long end. Oil suffered one of its worst days in months.




On Tuesday, the major equity indexes saw declines ranging from just under 0.8% by the S&P 500 to 1.1% by the Nasdaq composite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9%. The Dow Jones transportation average slumped almost 1.9%.


The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond dropped 6 basis points to 1.63%. The yield falls when bond prices rise. The 10-year bond's yield has now fallen 12 basis points from its March peak of 1.75%, according to data on the Cboe.


Ned Davis Research, in a note sent to clients, forecast that it's possible for the 10-year note's yields to shoot as high as 2.25% this year, or around 50 basis points above what it sees as fair value at 1.7%.


Stock Market Bears Heavy Institutional Selling
----------------------------------------------


Volume climbed on both main exchanges on Tuesday. Thus, these significant drops in heavier turnover vs. Monday added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the overall count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. But the Nasdaq also lost its Feb. 16 distribution day because 25 trading days have passed. So its count of institutional-quality sell-offs stays at five.


![MP032321](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MP032321-210x300.jpg)The Nasdaq initially looked poised to climb back above a key technical level, the 50-day moving average, as a number of FAANG stocks rallied early. But by day's end, even these megacap technology firms reversed into losses.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF halted a two-day winning streak, down 0.4%. As smaller banks and top retail chains fell en masse, the Nasdaq 100 was able to outperform for the day.


Companies such as **Texas Capital Bancshares** ([TCBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCBI)), seen in the Market Pulse table, scored their biggest single-session point declines of the year.


Closing the session at 80.60, Texas Capital is still up 35% year to date. That blows away a 2.6% advance by the Nasdaq composite since Jan. 1.


But three straight declines in heavy turnover indicate that fund managers are locking in gains.


The bank still has a solid cushion above its rising 50-day line.



Stock Market Today: Still Near All-Time Highs
---------------------------------------------


The S&P 500 trades just 2% below an all-time high of 3983. On Tuesday, the large-cap benchmark ended a few points above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


There was no such luck for the iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund. It got stung with a nearly 3.6% sell-off and closed below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) for the first time since Oct. 30.



This technical breach is important to keep watching.


In general, a healthy stock market shows key indexes rising above their 50-day lines and even leading them higher. Certainly, small caps could use some time off after making huge gains in the short term. Even at 217.21, the Russell 2000 ETF still holds a 127% gain from its low marked at the bottom of the 2020 coronavirus stock market crash.


Did This Market Get Too Hot?
----------------------------


Investors no doubt took a cue from a severe pullback in the price of oil. West Texas Intermediate futures sank 6.5% to $57.55 a barrel. A number of reports ranged from fears that oil in tanker ships is getting released into the market, to a story on Oilprice.com highlighting that Kazakhstan is eager to leave a deal among OPEC producers and Russia so it can boost its own production.


Headed into Tuesday's trading, the oil patch has been serving as an area of strength.


Among the [top 20-ranking industry groups](https://services.investors.com/pdf/DailyGMI032221.pdf) for six-month price performance, six hail from the oil and gas sector. The ship transport group, ranked No. 5, is closely tied to the crude oil industry.


Economic data on Tuesday was mixed. While U.S. new home sales in February sharply missed the [Econoday consensus estimate](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/), the Richmond Fed's manufacturing survey highlighted improving factory output. Meanwhile, economists on Wall Street noted a difference in views expressed by members of the Federal Reserve in charge of setting interest-rate policy.


For instance, Robert Kaplan of the Dallas Fed said on CNBC that he forecast a return to interest-rate hikes before the end of 2022, and that three more key officials share the same thinking.


But Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura, noted that Federal Reserve Gov. Lael Brainard "delivered remarks making the case for remaining patient through 2023. In particular, she highlighted uncertainty around the economic outlook despite strengthening data."

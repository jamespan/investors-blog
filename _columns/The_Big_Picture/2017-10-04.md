Dull can be good.


The major indexes posted dull gains on Wednesday, and for stock-position traders and active investors, such action was likely just fine. The Nasdaq composite gained less than 0.1%, but it brushed off a 20-minute sell-off at the session's start to finish high in the day's range.




The S&P 500 was up barely 0.1%. Gains in solar, automaker, homebuilding, water utility, alcoholic beverage and travel booking companies offset a sell-off in RV, hospital, pollution control, ship transport and logistics firms in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/).


The intraday range for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 was narrow: roughly half of one percent for the former, less than 0.4% for the latter. That's generally good for a market that has been rising nicely so far in 2017, and on top of a monster advance that stems all the way back with a market follow-through on March 12, 2009, by the S&P 500.


So is the fact that the market internals remain positive.


IBD's screened list of new highs continues to show hundreds of companies marking 52-week or all-time highs on a combined basis on both the Nasdaq and the Big Board. On [Wednesday's list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-04-2017/) alone, total Nasdaq and NYSE new highs came one stock shy of 500.


Did you see the top sectors in terms of the new highs? They include Finance at 29 stocks, Banks at 22, Business Services and Building at 18 each, and Medical at 17. (*See the entire list, and focus on those with strong EPS Ratings, at "New High" on the [New High List web page](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-04-2017/).*)


Why does IBD subdivide the new highs list in terms of broad industry sectors? Decades of research has found that strong stocks tend to come from strong industry sectors. Remember, one of the most important principles in growth investing is this: Strength begets strength.


A seventh up day in a row also reaffirmed the Nasdaq's dominance in 2017. At 6534, the tech-rich index now sports a 21% year-to-date gain, thumping the 13.4% lift by the S&P 500 and the 9.2% gain by the S&P SmallCap 600.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP_2x_100317-193x300.png)The S&P 600 surrendered 0.4%, ending its eight-day winning streak.


Volume was slightly lower on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


But please check out the large daily chart of the Nasdaq via the "General Market Indicators" page link at the bottom of this story. You'll see that in each of the Nasdaq's seven up sessions, volume came in higher than the 50-day average. When a market is rising in heavy trading, it's a matter-of-fact way of saying that the equity trading desks of large funds across the country are busy scooping up shares.


(The horizontal line running along the tips of the volume bars in the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average charts shows the 50-day moving average for volume.)


Investors seemed to hardly bat an eye on the report of a smaller than expected jump in September payrolls in the private sector (up 135,000, 5,000 jobs short of the [Econoday forecast](http://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)), as collected by the HR outsourcing company ADP. America is still in the middle of a massive recovery effort after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma smashed into the Houston area and South Florida, respectively. But the ISM services index showed a big jump in September at 59.8, well above the consensus view of 55.5 and ahead of 55.3 in August. A reading above 50 means activity is expanding.


Investors and economists are likely to lower their expectations for the government's report on U.S. unemployment and payrolls, set for release on Friday before the market's open.


Gains in the active management arena have been far from dull.


Through Tuesday, the IBD Mutual Fund Index showed a gain of almost 20%.


The index is made up of 20 growth and value-oriented mutual funds judged by IBD and its founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil as having some of the best long-term track records in the business.


When this index is thriving, take it as a sign that breakouts (especially by those in early stage bases and by companies with flat-out wonderful fundamentals) have a higher chance of succeeding.


At the same time, more highly rated stocks are also setting up in bases or are very close to new buy points, including **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Advanced Energy Industries** ([AEIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEIS)), **Kemet** ([KEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEM)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), and certain members of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/).


Ultimately, detecting the signs of a healthy market is actually pretty simple: Follow the action of the leaders.

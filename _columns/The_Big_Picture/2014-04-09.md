======================================================

The major indexes showed some vigor for a second straight session Wednesday as the market continued to recoup some of its near-term heavy losses.

  

Volume, however, fell across the board. Also, the back-to-back rebound was in no way a signal for growth investors to jump back in. With indexes not yet in position for a potential follow-through, IBD's current outlook remains at "Market in correction."

  

The Nasdaq composite led the field, rising 1.7% and finishing at its session peak. Solid gains by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) (up 1.3%), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) (up 7%), **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) (up 1.7%) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) (up 1.6%) helped. Together, the four mega-cap techs make up nearly 17% of the Nasdaq's total market value.

  

The S&P 500 added 1.1% after bouncing off its 50-day moving average and rising 0.4% the prior day. The large-cap gauge sits just 1% below its high of 1890.25.

  

Market breadth was good. On the NYSE, winners beat losers by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. On the Nasdaq, the ratio was closer to 5-to-2.

  

However, the picture is not so rosy when you view the market from a couple of different angles.

  

View the large daily chart of the S&P 500, and you'll see that over the past six weeks, the index has made virtually no headway, even after it jumped to new all-time highs last week.

  

The IBD 50, which shot 3% higher Wednesday, has been slumping for more than five weeks. Although all but five of the components rose on Wednesday, many are trying to repair damage to their charts. Others are extended after already forming multiple bases.

  

Finally, take a look at the Sector Leaders list. As of Wednesday's IBD, it contained just six names. On March 10, it had 16.

  

The minutes of the March 18-19 Federal Reserve meeting, released at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, helped fuel the rally after the notes revealed a lack of consensus on when the U.S. central bank should begin returning interest rates to higher levels. One reason: The Fed fears that there "might be considerably more labor-market slack than indicated by the unemployment rate alone." In its last meeting, the Fed removed the 6.5% jobless target as a prerequisite for taking action to tighten the money supply.

  

Is there still plenty of complacency in the market? Some may point to the low level of bearish market pundits noted by Investors Intelligence, which remained at 18.6%. When the market unleashed a strong rally on Dec. 20, 2011, with a follow-through, bears had climbed to 46.3%.

  

DeVere Group, in its March 18 survey, found that 57% of 756 high-net-worth clients surveyed felt bullish about the investment outlook over the next 12 months â€” just shy of the 59% level seen in March 2007. The CBOE Market Volatility index is well below its 12-month high of 22.3.

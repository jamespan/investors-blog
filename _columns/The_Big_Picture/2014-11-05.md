Market Leaders Cool Off As S&P 500 Leads Upside
================================================

Stocks rallied and the S&P 500 marked a fresh closing high Wednesday, but leading stocks struggled.

  

A convincing election victory by Republicans to win back control of the Senate certainly gave buyers some courage. Yet the day's action also seemed to show some big market winners falling prey to the "buy on the rumor, sell on the news" phenomenon.

  

As a result, some breakouts have faltered for now.

  

Market leaders **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) and **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)), which finished a 10-for-1 share split, have fallen below their 110.74 and 23.05 buy points, respectively.

  

**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), which reported slowing top- and bottom-line growth in the third quarter, slid 12% and clipped its 50-day moving average in heavy trade.

  

The IBD 50, down 0.5%, lagged the market.

  

The S&P 500 was the day's big winner, rising nearly 0.6%. With a record close of 2023.57, the large-cap benchmark is now up 9.5% year-to-date. The S&P 500 gained 29.6% in 2013.

  

The Nasdaq composite surrendered a modest early gain to finish less than 0.1% lower. Losses exceeding 1% by **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) proved burdensome for the index.

  

Volume was virtually flat on both exchanges, slightly up on the Nasdaq.

  

Despite a two-day losing streak for the Nasdaq, there's little to frown about in the market's recent action.

  

Since the Oct. 21 follow-through, the market has clearly moved higher. Distribution, or clear signs of intense selling by fund managers, is still minimal.

  

The advance-decline lines of both exchanges have risen sharply since mid-October. And the new high list is booming. New highs for Nasdaq and NYSE-listed stocks totaled 303 in the Oct. 29 IBD, 323 on Oct. 31 and a whopping 554 in Monday's paper.

  

Disciplined trading still wins, though.

  

A stock that breaks out and strikes a 52-week high is still prone to a sharp pullback, even just days into a new rally. That's why it's crucial to buy near the proper buy point. Grabbing shares when the stock is already up 5%, 10% or more from the correct buy point leaves an investor vulnerable to a stinging loss fast.

  

Certain industry groups, such as chemicals and airlines, are getting a tailwind from the plunge in crude oil prices. But IBD's industry groups table (on Page B2) shows numerous groups in the top 20 that are dynamic leaders with high levels of profit and sales growth.

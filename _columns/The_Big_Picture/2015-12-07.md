Stocks fell Monday, signaling that sellers were not done despite Friday's big comeback. The Nasdaq shaved a 1.1% loss to 0.8%. It returned a little less than half of Friday's move.


The S&P 500 gave up 0.7% after being down as much as 1.2% at Monday's low. Energy stocks were battered as crude oil tumbled nearly 6%, to $37.65 a barrel amid a higher dollar and Friday's lack of action from OPEC. (See [Oil Plunges 6% After OPEC Fails To Cut Output](http://news.investors.com/investing-futures/120715-784160-oil-plunges-6-after-opec-fails-to-cut-output.htm).)


Seven of Monday's 10 worst-performing industry groups were from the oil and gas space. But airlines relished the slide in oil prices. The airline group cruised up 1.2%. **JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)) and **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) rallied 4% each.

But the small-cap Russell 2000 took the worst hit, down 1.6%. Small caps had previously had periods of outperformance in late November, suggesting risk-taking was back on.


The IBD 50 dropped 0.9%, with 36 issues lower. Homebuilder **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) was the biggest decliner, down 11% in nearly triple its average volume. The day's clear violation of support at the 50-day line in huge trade can be used as a sell signal.


Losers swamped winners by about 4-to-1 on the NYSE and more than 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


Volume ended mixed Monday. Trade fell on the NYSE and rose on the Nasdaq from Friday's pace.


The day's loss in higher turnover marked another distribution day for the tech-heavy index. Distribution days signal professional selling. But at the same time, the Oct. 30 distribution day on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 expired due to time.


Note that the level of distribution in the indexes is still high, and lately distribution days are starting to cluster, which is something to watch out for. The Nasdaq has racked up distribution days four of the past six sessions.


With the market under pressure, investors should look to do some portfolio management. Sell stocks that fall 7% or 8% from their buy points. Take sizable profits when you have them. Some leaders have produced big gains and are getting close to 20% from their breakouts. These include **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) and **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) .


There's been no shortage of opportunities in the current uptrend. Gun maker **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) broke out Monday, while **Virgin America** ([VA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VA)) and **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) each tried to break out but closed below their buy points.

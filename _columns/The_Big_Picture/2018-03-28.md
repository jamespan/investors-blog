title: Will Techs Drive Stock Market Into Bear Territory? Time To Ignore This Hold Rule?

Techs have been a dominant force in the stock market since IBD noted a change in trend with a [follow-through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) day on Feb. 17, 2016. (Note, this is the one that took place two years, ago, not the one that took place on Valentine's Day this year.)




It should come as little surprise, then, for most IBD readers to see semiconductor, software, internet and other related issues take more of a pounding as the stock market sees its second intermediate-level correction unfold so far this year.


The Nasdaq composite, which still holds a commanding lead over its index peers in recent years (an 81% climb since that early 2016 follow-through more than two years ago, vs. a 59% gain for the S&P 500 over the same time frame), naturally led the decline. It fell 0.9%, shaving off nearly half of its 1.5% intraday drop. The Nasdaq 100, representing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, slid 1.1% and pierced the 6500 level for the first time since Feb. 8.


Strength in many food, select utility, some cyclical and a sprinkling of retailing corners of the equities market helped the other indexes do relatively better. The Dow Jones industrial average seesawed all day long and spent the bulk of the 6-1/2-hour trading session in mild positive territory before finishing down just 9 points, less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 eased 0.3%.


The S&P 500 hit a session low of 2593, coming within an index finger's length of hitting an intermediate correction, which is a drop of at least 10% from the 52-week peak. Such declines are in fact healthy for stocks as they help curb excess investor enthusiasm.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP032818-250x300.png)Volume ballooned more than 9% on the Nasdaq and edged 4% higher on the NYSE. But with the market already in correction status, a new [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) for the Nasdaq is a moot point.


The S&P SmallCap 600 bucked the overall downdraft, rising nearly 0.2%. The Russell 2000 ended virtually flat. The Dow utility average, a laggard all year, edged 0.2% lower.


With just one trading day left in the first quarter of 2018, the Nasdaq has seen its gain since Jan. 1 shrink fast in recent weeks, from up as much as 10.6% to just 0.7%. The S&P 500, now at 2605, has reversed from a 7% lift year to date to a 2.6% fall.


The IBD Mutual Fund index has encountered similar deflation, up just 0.3% through Thursday's close. (*See the chart in the GMI page, accessible as a PDF link at the bottom of this column.*)


For now, stocks are indeed acting the way they should when the IBD current outlook shifts from "uptrend under pressure" to "market in correction." The biggest winners in recent months and years will tend to fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times as much as the major indexes do. What does this mean? With the Nasdaq at 6949, down 9% from its 7637 all-time peak, expect some of the leaders to fall anywhere from roughly 14% to 23% from their own 52-week or all-time peaks.


Seasoned readers know that declines of that magnitude can lead to short-term pain but future long-term gain.


Why? A [flat-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), in which the decline must not exceed 15%, would be a quiet way of saying mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, sovereign wealth funds and the like are not selling too hard. So would a [cup with handle](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/)Â or which both must last at least seven weeks.

If we see the market continue to gyrate, expect more [double-bottom-base patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) to form. Most of the really successful cup and double bottom bases are going to show corrections of 12% to 30%. The size of the prior uptrend is a factor, too.


This Tech Makes A Round Trip
----------------------------


The round-trip action by innovative new digital payments firm **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) sheds important fresh light on one of IBD's most important sell rules, which really isn't a sell rule. When a stock breaks out and rises 20% or more in the short span of three weeks or less, a rule invented by IBD founder Bill O'Neil is to hold that stock for a full eight weeks, then reassess the chart. After that, decide to hold longer or sell and take the gains.


Such a rule is brilliant during the early stages of a bull run. You don't want to cut your winners short. Give them time to grow into true market leaders.


However, whether you see the current bull market's start as March 2009 or September 2011, the last two times in which any major market fell 20% or more off their peaks, the run has been exceptionally long. This is why in Leaderboard and in IBD's market columns, the emphasis has been to take at least partial gains on the way up, at 20%-25% or possibly more, before a sharp correction takes place.



Square ran up 20% from a recent cup with deep handle at 47.60 in the space of just 12 sessions. That's a strong run. But it came after big gains in 2017 that were punctuated by climax-run-like action in the fourth quarter. Square eventually hit as high as 58.46, up 22.8%, before turning tail.


Back to Wednesday's action, the conviction among institutions in deciding to load up, keep or dump U.S. equities can be monitored this way: Watch to see how the Nasdaq behaves in the next few weeks. Will it fall further, attempting to touch or pierce its long-term 200-day moving average? Will it undercut the Feb. 9 near-term low of 6630? Or will bargain hunters step in and keep the long series of higher highs and higher lows going further?


The 200-day moving average is best viewed on a [MarketSmith daily chart](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF).


Clearly, fear has been rising but not quite at boiling levels. The put-call volume ratio, part of IBD's [collection of key psychological market indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), has not topped its year-to-date twin peaks of 1.26 and 1.27. The [bulls-bears ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) is nowhere near a point in which the ratio of bearish newsletter writers exceeds the bullish ratio. And the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), or the VIX, is miles below its Feb. 6 spike of 50.30.


Strangely enough on Wednesday, winners exceeded losers on the NYSE by around 100 issues, according to early data. Given how much damage the Nasdaq took, the breadth in that market wasn't too bad. Falling stocks beat winners by a roughly 16-13 margin.


In retail land, yogawear pioneer **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) jumped past stubborn resistance near the 83-84 level on outstanding Q4 results.

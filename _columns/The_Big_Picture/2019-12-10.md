  Small Cap Stocks Lead In Anticlimactic Day; Avoid This Big Investing Mistake Now

Hype over hearsay on what the White House will do about Sunday's plan to impose new tariffs on Chinese imports dictated the first few hours of trading. Yet Tuesday's action ultimately proved neither smartly bullish nor bearishly harmful. Small caps gained some ground, but in inches, not feet.




The Nasdaq composite, finishing the day down 5 points, or less than 0.1%, made a sloppy start. It opened a bit weak, but then rebounded as much as 0.5% from the day's low established in the first 10 minutes of trade. The impetus? One news organization reported sources in the Trump administration saying the U.S. president is mulling the idea of postponing new tariffs beyond the scheduled Sunday date.


Then, CNBC reported comments from Larry Kudlow, a key economic advisor to Trump, that all but nixed that intention. Stocks slumped, but not sharply.


The Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF surrendered less than 1 point, helped by a small gain among semiconductor shares. The S&P 500 lost 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 edged less than 1 point lower. The Russell 2000 rose 0.1%.


Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) edged 0.2% lower, following Monday's nearly 0.8% retreat. Yet at 34.66, the growth stock-oriented exchange traded fund is holding on to a nifty Q4 advance of 7.4%.

Exactly a year ago, IBD's current outlook for stocks was worse than it is today, and it went downhill fast.


Beyond Small Cap Stocks: Not Like Last December
-----------------------------------------------


On Dec. 10, 2018, IBD's market outlook of "uptrend under pressure" signaled IBD readers to be cautious in making any new buys. The outlook got downgraded on Dec. 4, just days after a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 raised the outlook to "market in confirmed uptrend," one of the best times to buy leading growth stocks. On Dec. 4, the Nasdaq slid 3.8%, the S&P 500 3.2%. Then on Dec. 17, IBD moved the outlook back to "correction," the weakest outlook, when the Nasdaq undercut a key short-term low set on Nov. 20.


In short, it did not take many big days of effusive selling by mutual funds, banks, insurers and the like for the market trend to change quickly.


Fast forward to today. The Market Pulse shows an elevated count of distribution days, particularly on the Nasdaq.


Yet keep in mind that one of the recent distribution days was a [rare stalling day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/).


Looking at the five other Nasdaq distributions, only one — the 1.1% drop in higher volume Dec. 2 — showed real teeth. The other sell-offs ranged from a decline of 0.3% to 0.5%.


News on a bump up in small business confidence (see the NFIB report in [IBD's economic calendar](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/)) and a revised small drop in Q3 productivity seemed to have little to no impact on stocks. Wednesday's announcement after the Federal Reserve's final meeting this year on interest rates may not have much impact either. On Tuesday, the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond yielded 1.85%, up 2 basis points from the start of the month.


Ultimately, investors want clarity on the next move in a U.S.-China trade war that is closing in on two years.


Don't Commit This Mistake
-------------------------


Many growth stocks are [forming bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), a bullish trend these days. But with the market still sensitive to trade-related headlines, make sure that you avoid an unnecessary loss by buying a stock too early.



**Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) offers a current example, although it's not affected by trade issues. Nearly two weeks ago, it looked like the specialist in products to treat solid tumors completed a lovely handle on its cup pattern. A 96.24 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was set. By Dec. 3, the nearly 12% decline from the handle's high to low and downward slope along its lows met the requirement of a [good handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/).


Yet over the past four days, Novocure has fallen more than 10%. Now it's faced with a test of buying support at the 50-day moving average.


Patience in waiting for a [proper breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/)? Likely just as precious as being patient with your best stocks after they surpass a proper buy point in strong volume and rise like a true market leader.



**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), a stock of particular interest among participants in [today's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live), has now undercut its just-formed 50-day moving average. At Monday's low of 34.10, the new issue and member of IBD's enterprise software group fell as much as 18% from a 41.54 buy point in a sloppy cup base.


**Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) has been stretching its own [handle on a cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).

Stock Market Internals Remain Solid
-----------------------------------


[The homepage of MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) showed a slighter larger number of stocks rising in heavy volume (157) vs. those that fell in above-average turnover (130). That's bullish for growth stock investors. The reason: It indicates that large institutional investors are more anxious to deploy cash to work than to raise cash.


On Tuesday, only a total [168 stocks made a new 52-week or all-time high](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-dec-10-2019/) on either the Nasdaq or on the NYSE. However, that still compares favorably with 57 issues pulling to new lows.


As seen in [the new highs list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-dec-10-2019/), stocks in the bank, real estate, retail and medical sectors dominated the new highs list. Click on "New Highs" and "New Lows" to see the stocks arranged by sector.

  Bears Rip Stocks As The Market Outlook Changes

Bears raised a ruckus Thursday, as the stock market showed more signs of institutional selling.




 The Dow Jones industrial average staggered 4.1% lower, while the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 tumbled 3.9% and 3.8%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 2.9%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and on the NYSE.


Index lows set Tuesday gave way under the bearish onslaught.


The selling in rising volume constituted [distribution](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), the footprint of institutional selling. In another bad sign, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 met resistance at the [50-day moving average](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). The distribution-day count along with weak action in the indexes were enough to tip the market outlook to correction. That's a poorer condition than the previous IBD outlook, which saw the market uptrend under pressure.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MP020818-202x300.png) With the market in correction, individual investors should avoid stock purchases. Raising cash is prudent, and taking at least some profits makes sense.


The question individual investors need to ask now is this:


Are the stocks in the individual's portfolio strong enough that the investor is willing to hold through turbulence or a base building?


The answer comes down to one word: conviction.


Conviction shouldn't be confused with either wishful thinking or how much an investor likes a stock. Only the very best stocks with great fundamentals and institutional support are deserving of high conviction.


In most cases, investors are going to want to take some money off the table, if they haven't already.


Old investors like to say there's always a bullish niche somewhere in a bear market and always a bearish niche within a bull market.


What has the recent sell-off rendered in that regard?


Industry groups that are in a bear market — off at least 20% and continuing south — include: dairy products, down about 55% since May 2015; gold miners, off 29% since August 2016; drugstores, down about 35% since August 2015; and chip equipment makers, off about 23% since November.


Of course, dairy, gold miners and drugstores didn't need the latest sell-off to reach bear territory.


But the chip-equipment makers did.


Other groups have been knocked down at least 20% off their highs recently — homebuilders and RVs come to mind — but the jury is still out on their direction. The two groups could rebound — undoing the 20% plus drop that defines bearish action — or they could fall further south into their own little bear market.


In regard to a bullish niche, there isn't much for bulls to trumpet right now.


In the past five sessions, only two of IBD's 197 industry groups have notched a gain — fiber optics and toys. Everything else has lost ground.


On Thursday, the pullback reached 9.7% on the Nasdaq and 10.2% on the S&P 500. The last time the indexes fell significantly more than that was December 2015 to February 2016 (down almost 19%) and August 2015 (down about 18%). The Nasdaq had a lesser 11.6% decline in June 2016.


A 20% pullback in the Nasdaq would take the index back to the 6000 area and the S&P 500 to the 2300 area.


Before that happens, though, a test around the 200-day moving averages might emerge. The 200-day lines currently represent an 11% to 13% pullback off the recent highs. That's not a long way from where the market is now.


An additional bad sign for this market is the split record among the leaders. The FANG stocks and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) illustrate the irregularity.


Last year, the FANG stocks and Apple marched upward in unity. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) rose 53%; **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), 56%; **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), 55%; and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), 33%. Apple rose 46%.


So far, this year, Facebook is down 3%. Alphabet is off 4% and Apple down 8%. But Netflix is up 30% and Amazon.com is up 15%.


Economic News
-------------

Friday is expected to be a light day for financial news.

The first day of the fourth quarter was more of the same for the major stock indexes Monday with fresh all-time highs for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite.




The Dow added 0.7% as nearly a third of the components rose 1% or more. Leaders included **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)). The S&P 500 added 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite picked up 0.3%.


Meanwhile, after six straight gains, the Russell 2000 small-cap index took out the 1500 level with relative ease, rising more than 1.2%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) also did well, rising 0.7%. Volume edged lower on the Nasdaq and the NYSE in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today).


The Nasdaq 100 was a notable laggard Monday, rising less than 0.1%, as names like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) ended lower.


Advancers led decliners by 9-to-5 on the NYSE and by nearly 11-to-5 on the Nasdaq.


The day's performance was overshadowed by a mass shooting late Sunday in Las Vegas that killed at least 58 people and injured more than 500. [Casino stocks closed mixed](https://www.investors.com/news/casino-stocks-fall-on-mass-shooting-mgm-delays-opening-macau-hotel/). **MGM Resorts** ([MGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MGM)), which owns the Mandalay Bay hotel from where the gunman fired into a crowd, fell 5.6% in heavy trading.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MP100217-170x300.png)The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up 1 basis point to 2.34% on news the ISM manufacturing for September came in better than expected at 60.8 vs the consensus estimate of 58.


With just two distribution days now for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500, the take-away is that it's not a market under meaningful distribution. That wasn't the case starting in late July and going into mid-August when higher-volume declines started to cluster in the Nasdaq. But it was occurring around the Nasdaq's 50-day moving average, which has proved itself a solid support level this year.


Meanwhile, a look at the charts of market-leading growth stocks like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) are not indicative of market where potential trouble is looming.


For these reasons, the market uptrend still must be respected. When it come to new buys, though, it's important not to let small losses spiral out of control. Always follow sell rules, and when it comes to your winners, don't be afraid to let them run, but always be on the lookout for signs of institutional selling. It's OK to take full or partial profits if the market is telling you to do so.


Tech bellwethers like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) look a bit vulnerable, under their 50-day moving averages with Accumulation/Distribution Ratings of E, the worst possible. And don't forget about **Netflix**, which gave up the 50-day moving average Monday, falling 2% in heavy volume. It's softness in large stocks like these that helps explain why the Nasdaq 100 did not make a new high Monday while other indexes, including the Nasdaq composite, did.


In terms of technically healthy stocks, they can be found every day in screens like the IBD 50 and [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), but the question investors need to consider is this: Is institutional buying demand strong enough to fuel the breakouts? There's been no shortage of breakouts lately that have been lacking in volume.


Among the day's gainers, **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) jumped 5% to 44 in heavy volume. It's extended from a prior 39.10 entry, but the stock on Monday cleared a 43.10 buy point from a handle in the pattern. This buy point is worth considering for those who don't own shares yet.


Fellow enterprise software firm **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) picked up nearly 2% in about 30% more volume than average. It closed 3 cents above a 49.75 buy point.


The session yielded a few heavy-volume breakouts. **Insperity** ([NSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSP)) cleared a 90.35 buy point in heavy volume, rising more than 3% to 90.95. It's still well with the 5% buy zone. **Merit Medical** ([MMSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMSI)) popped 4% to 44.10. It's still in range from a 42.70 entry.


**YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) and **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)) turned in solid showings in the IBD 50, rising around 4% each. YY has performed admirably since breaking out of a base with an 83.10 buy point. Alarm.com, meanwhile, is no slouch either. It ended Monday just above an add-on buy point of 46.03 from a four-weeks-tight pattern.


Department store operators were weak again after the New York Post reported that talks to take **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) private have hit some stumbling blocks. Shares of Nordstrom slumped 6%, while group peers **J.C. Penney** ([JCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCP)) gave up 6% and **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) lost 4%.


Benchmark crude oil for November delivery settled at 50.58 a barrel, down $1.09, or 2.1%. Production from the 13 OPEC members participating in an agreement to cut output saw an increase of 60,000 barrels per day last month vs. August, according to a Reuters survey Friday.

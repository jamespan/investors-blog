Stock Market Closes Lower As S&P 500 Makes Key Test; Nasdaq Battles Near 15,000
================================================================================

Technology stocks and small caps faced another round of selling in the stock market Friday as money continued to flow into energy and financial stocks.




The Nasdaq fell 1%, extending its losing streak to four sessions, but volume fell from Thursday's level. The index is still holding above its Dec. 20 low but it's not far from a test of the 200-day moving average. It's testing the 15,000 level.


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) fell for the fourth straight session in above-average volume, hurt by weak performances from top stocks like **Lam Research** ([LRCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LRCX)), **KLA Corp**. ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)).


[Chip stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) bore the brunt of the selling Friday, with IBD's fabless group down around 4% and the chip equipment group down 3.3%. IBD's homebuilding group also fell nearly 5%.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 2.6% and slumped more than 8% for the week. The fund gave back 3.2% in December after a 6% drop in November. With FFTY now 20% off its high, growth stocks have been in a bear market for a while.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MP010722-276x300.jpg)Growth investors should be defensive at this point. Some new buys in the energy and financial sectors are probably working well but aggressively increasing exposure doesn't make sense, particularly in the technology sector. Keep stocks on your watchlist showing relative strength. Some may be finding support at a key level, while others may still be near buy points.


Rising Bond Yields
------------------


The 10-year Treasury yield surged 26 basis points for the week, ending around 1.77%. It hit a high of 1.80% Friday, the highest level in nearly two years. The minutes from the mid-December Federal Reserve meeting, released Wednesday, showed the Fed is getting ready to start reducing its bloated balance sheet, which currently holds more than $8 trillion in bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Selling these bonds could cause rates to spike even higher.


A research report from Truist Securities late Thursday noted that stocks tend to outperform fixed income during Fed tightening cycles. Stocks have risen at an average annualized rate of 9% during 12 Fed rate hike cycles since the 1950s. Stocks showed positive returns in 11 of those instances.

That gives the bulls reason for hope, but the 200-day moving average for both Nasdaq indexes is a key support level to watch.


Muted Selling In Dow, S&P 500
-----------------------------


Selling has been much less pronounced in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 as both indexes hold above their 50-day lines. The Dow was nearly flat Friday, buoyed by better than 2% gains for **Walgreens** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)), **Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)), which topped a buy point.


Cruise line operators and airline stocks outperformed, which eased 0.4% and closed just above its 50-day line. Meanwhile, sellers continued to hit small-cap stocks. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) fell 1.2% and nearly 3% for the week. Look at the ETF's weekly chart and you'll see the converged 10-week and 40-week moving average lines are a resistance level.


NYSE volume was also lower than Thursday, while NYSE decliners only had a slight edge over advancers.



Three mining stocks were among the best gainers in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com). **Alcoa** ([AA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AA)) moved nicely above the 60 level to an all-time high, but it's too far extended after a breakout from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) with a 52.96 entry. **Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) jumped 4.5% to 30.41. It's still near a 30.02 buy point after the stock gave an early buy signal with a breakout over a [trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/). **Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) added 3% as it holds just above a 41.70 entry.

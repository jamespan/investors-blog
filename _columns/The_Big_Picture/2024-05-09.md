  Dow Jones Extends Win Streak; Market Leaders Pinterest, NetApp At Buy Points

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and small caps led the stock market higher Thursday, as the blue-chip index rallied for a seventh straight session. Amid an ongoing rebound, the major stock indexes are closing in on new highs.




The stock market got off to a good start as data pointed to a weaker job market. Prior to Thursday's open, the Labor Department's first-time jobless claims jumped to 231,000. That topped 208,000 in the previous week and was the highest level since August 2023. They were expected to rise modestly to 212,000, per Econoday. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 3 basis points to nearly 4.45%.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9% while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite moved up 0.3%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 also rallied 0.9%.


Volume inched lower on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange vs. Wednesday's session.


Early Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment numbers are due out. The index is expected to fall to 77 for May, down from April's 77.2 reading, per Econoday estimates. Year-ahead inflation expectations for May are expected to hold steady at 3.2%.

Dow Jones: Home Depot, Caterpillar Rally
----------------------------------------


In the Dow Jones index, **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) were the biggest winners, up 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Home Depot remains below its 50-day line, while Caterpillar is trying to retake that benchmark. The two stocks added about 100 points to the Dow's 331-point advance.


On the downside, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) sank more than 2%. The stock closed 17% off its 52-week high.


[Among Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-to-buy-and-and-watch/), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) were the biggest losers, down 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Nvidia remains just above its 50-day line, while Tesla extended a losing streak to three sessions.


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 1.3%. In the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Samsara** ([IOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IOT)) rallied 3.5% Thursday, moving closer to a cup base's 40.54 buy point.

Distribution Days In The Stock Market
-------------------------------------


While there has been no [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) yet, IBD's recommended market exposure sits at 40% to 60% as the market extends its rebound and the main indexes sit about 1% away from new highs.


Readers may be surprised to see distribution-day count suddenly back on the Market Pulse. Normally, distribution days aren't counted until a follow-through occurs.


Yet, the market keeps acting like it's in an uptrend despite the lack of a follow-through, and IBD's recommended market exposure has been increased to reflect that reality.


Thus, it makes sense to take into account the distribution days that have occurred since we moved up the exposure level to 20%-40%, most recently on April 26. Through Thursday, that's a total of two distribution days on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 (April 30 and May 1) plus a stalling day on the S&P 500 on Tuesday.


When the exposure threshold goes down to 0%-20%, IBD will reset the distribution-day count and then start counting them again when the threshold is increased to 20%-40% or greater.


Investors should remember that while the number of distribution days remains pertinent, a clustering of distribution days over a period of several days can be particularly bearish.


Stock Market Resumes Advance
----------------------------


The main indexes briefly paused earlier this week, and Thursday's gains indicated they are resuming what's been so far a solid rebound.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 traded slightly lower on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones industrials climbed. And the Nasdaq closed near highs, indicating that buyers are still going strong. With solid price action holding up, it still makes sense for investors to slowly increase exposure as new opportunities present themselves.


A number of breakouts have provided fresh opportunities to raise exposure. Remember, the best stocks will have strong [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/). RS lines that hit new highs on or before the breakout day could be poised to be market leaders.


In [IBD MarketSurge's](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq) "Breaking Out Today" list Thursday, insurer **Manulife Financial** ([MFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MFC)) rallied past a 25.14 buy point in a flat base. Shares closed in the 5% buy range that runs up to 26.40. Meanwhile, **Cintas** ([CTAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTAS)) is rapidly nearing a 704.84 buy point as it shapes an orderly flat base.

Market Leaders: Ares, NetApp, Pinterest, Star Bulk
--------------------------------------------------



**Ares** **Management** ([ARES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARES)), **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)), along with **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) and **Star Bulk Carriers** ([SBLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBLK)) are among stocks to watch.


[New IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Ares Management closed Thursday in buy range past a flat base's 139.48 buy point amid a four-day win streak.


NetApp is trying to break out past a double-bottom [entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 108.82. Bullishly, its Relative Strength line made a new high on the breakout day, a sign of outperformance.


Pinterest gave up a part of this week's gains Thursday, with a 0.3% loss. The stock remains in the buy zone above a 41.60 buy point in a cup base.


And Star Bulk Carriers finished in the 5% buy area past a 25.16 flat-base buy trigger following [Tuesday's breakout move](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dividend-stock-star-bulk-carriers-stock-breaks-out-earnings/).

Indexes Close Virtually Flat; Nasdaq 100 Holds Decent Year-To-Date Gain

The stock market avoided another sharp loss on Wednesday, but it didn't make much headway, either. Meanwhile, small-cap stocks flexed a bit more strength than their large-cap brethren.

  

The Nasdaq composite spent the day in a relatively narrow trading band before finishing less than 0.1% higher. That hardly put a dent into Tuesday's 0.7% decline. Nasdaq volume fell.

  

Looking at the big daily moves since July 1 by the premier growth index, the Nasdaq has chalked up just one gain of 1% or more, the 1.6% lift on July 18. In contrast, the Nasdaq has suffered three sessions of 1%-plus losses. From May 7 through June 30, no such heavy decline occurred.

  

The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1%, following the prior day's 1% sell-off. NYSE volume rose. Like the Nasdaq, since July 1, the large-cap benchmark has scored merely one day of gains that reached at least 1%.

  

While the major indexes continue to hover fairly close to their 52-week or all-time peaks, it's not a time to be complacent, hopeful, greedy or apathetic. When a market's status is in correction, it means that most stocks tend to fall.

  

New buys and breakout generally won't work out well. Yes, a few exceptions will take place, and indeed, not every industry group or broad sector will whistle the same tune. Yet, it's smart to play the percentages. That's what coaches, hitters and pitchers do at the major-league level.

  

Speaking of exceptions, it's worth noting that some areas of the vast computer sector have been getting on base while the rest of the team strikes out.

  

Check out the current daily rankings of IBD's 197 industry groups, found at the bottom of this page. As of Wednesday's newspaper, four of the top 20 groups hailed from computer hardware and semiconductors. For instance, it's no secret that the chip sector has been enjoying a bountiful harvest productionwise so far this year.

  

The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on that exchange, reflects this sector's strength. The index edged slightly lower Wednesday but remains up nearly 7.9% since Jan. 1.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), a big driver of gains in IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals industry group, is trading as if the market is not in a correction. Since clearing a flat base at 82.26 in April, the stock has rallied as much as 21%. It has yet to touch its rising 50-day moving average.

  

Perhaps in reaction to escalating global tensions stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, strife between Israel and Hamas, the financial mess in Argentina, and the threat of recession in eurozone heavyweight Italy (see today's [International Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing-international-leaders/080614-712113-germany-italy-data-dent-eurozone-markets.htm) column), optimism among market pundits is cooling off. The latest bulls-bears survey by Investors Intelligence shows bullishness at 50.5%, matching a nearly four-month-low. The put-call volume ratio, charted at the bottom of this page, is also elevated.

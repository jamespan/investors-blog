Stocks wavered to a modestly higher finish Monday as attention now turns to earnings. Internet, solar and software stocks helped the Nasdaq to a nearly 0.2% gain and another record high. Monday marked its seventh gain in the past eight sessions.

  

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1% each. But the small-cap Russell 2000 fell for a second straight day, down 0.5%. It again showed divergent action compared to big-cap indexes. **Fitbit** ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)) was one small-cap that was weak Monday. It slumped nearly 6% — its biggest loss since [going public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) June 18.

  

Volume ended lower across the board Monday after a busy session Friday. Despite the small gain in the market, decliners beat winners a little over 2-to-1 on both major exchanges.

  

Still, some leaders had a nice day as the IBD 50 rallied 0.6%. **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) rallied smartly. Horizon reached the 20% to 25% profit-taking level from a 32.25 entry in a flat base.

  

Stocks such as **Medidata Solutions** ([MDSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDSO)), **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) and **Lennox International** ([LII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LII)) cleared bases Monday.

  

The trading environment has improved as worries over Greece are out of the way for now. The market outlook is back to a confirmed rally. But with the main focus now being corporate earnings, investors still need to trend cautiously.

  

Earnings season can bring about volatility and opportunity. A company that reports better-than-expected earnings and sales — and gives a bright outlook — will often see a pop in its stock. But investors can be punished if a company misses any combination or all of the three. So it makes sense to tread cautiously.

  

Report-card time is a key event in the market, but it can be tough to deal with for investors. A short Investor's Corner series on topics ranging from whether one should trade during earnings season to portfolio management to evaluating a company's results will start in Friday's IBD.

  

This week brings a large number of reports (see B2 in Monday's IBD). **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Hasbro** ([HAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAS)) and **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) were among a few firms that posted better-than-expected results Monday.

  

**IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) delivered mixed results after Monday's close (see the Internet & Technology section on A4). **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)), **Polaris Industries** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)), **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and more are on tap to report this week.

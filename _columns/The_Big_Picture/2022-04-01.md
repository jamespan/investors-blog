Stock Market Shows Resilience As Bond Yields Surge; Transports Whacked Amid Growth Concerns
============================================================================================

Major stock indexes kicked off the second quarter with modest gains and a close near highs after a rough first quarter for the stock market saw the Nasdaq composite plunge 9%.




Small caps led the way, with the Russell 2000 up 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite added 0.3%. each. Preliminary data showed lower volume on both exchanges. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1.


A late-session rally was impressive even as bond yields spiked after the [March jobs report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-unemployment-rate-slides-amid-solid-hiring-dow-jones/). The 2-year yield jumped 17 basis points to 2.46%, inverting with the 10-year yield, which rose 5 basis points to 2.38%.

While inverted yield curves have signaled economic slowdowns and recessions in the past, it doesn't mean that a slowdown is right around the corner. Research from Deutsche Bank earlier this week called an inverted yield curve a "poor indicator of timing," noting that while five of the past six inversions preceded a recession, it took seven to 34 months from the inversion to each recession's onset.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Nonfarm payrolls rose 431,000 in March, below the 490,000 consensus. But the unemployment rate fell slightly more than expected to 3.6%, while job growth in January and February was revised higher by a combined 95,000. The report raised the chances even more of a half-point hike by the Federal Reserve at the May meeting. Half-point hikes at the June and July are also a possibility, according to the [CME Group FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) tool.


Much of the leadership in the S&P 500 Friday came from health care stocks like **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)). Defensive stocks like **Clorox** ([CLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLX)) and **Philip Morris International** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)) also outperformed.


But the bigger story was broad-based selling in transportation stocks like **J.B.** **Hunt Transport Services** ([JBHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBHT)) and **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)). The iShares Transportation ETF ([IYT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IYT)) plunged nearly 4% in heavy volume.


Semiconductor stocks and regional banks also lagged.

Patience Is A Virtue
--------------------


Oil and gas stocks dominated the upside again in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com), but it's hard to find actionable stocks because they've been running higher for a while. The sector is filled with extended stocks. The same holds true for mining, steel, fertilizer and shipping stocks, which continue to show relative strength.


The main challenge for investors at this point is finding good setups. Don't force the issue by buying laggard stocks in an industry group.


The technology sector remains scant with prospects, although [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) continues to trade well. It's less than 7% off its high as it forms a cup base.Â Security software stocks like **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) are also showing relative strength.

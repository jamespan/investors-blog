Stock Market Cheers Coronavirus Vaccine News, But Leading Groups Hit Again
===========================================================================

The stock market started off in a great mood Wednesday with gains of 1.1% to 1.6% for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Positive coronavirus vaccine news from **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and a strong earnings report from **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) fueled morning gains.




Sellers came into the Nasdaq in late-morning trade, and a 1.1% gain turned into a loss. But it didn't take long for the stock market to find its footing, and major stock indexes closed solidly higher, ending in the top half of the day's price ranges.


The Russell 2000 small-cap index was the star of the day, up 3.5%, helped by strength in casino operators, movie theaters and restaurants.


The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) gapped up and closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 9.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP071420-1-226x300.jpg)Financial stocks also outperformed, but a 5% early gain for Goldman Sachs faded to 1.3% by the close. Goldman briefly topped a 223.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) but closed well off highs.


Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) closed near its high, up 2%.


The Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 added around 0.9% each, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 0.6%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Tuesday.


Stock Market Today: Chip Stocks Lag
-----------------------------------


The Nasdaq 100 could only muster a gain of 0.1%, weighed down by weakness in [semiconductor stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), chip gear makers **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), and e-commerce giant **Amazon.com** ([ANZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANZN)).


Beaten down stocks like hotel operators, airlines and cruise line operators led the stock market Wednesday, helped by the Moderna news. But several top-rated industry groups came under pressure again. Internet retailers like **Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)), Amazon and China-based **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) ended with losses of around 2%. Software stocks also lagged.


The [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) count for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remains relatively light. Of the S&P 500's four distribution days, the worst percentage decline in higher volume was on Monday, when the index fell 0.9%. Granted, it was a nasty reversal, but the S&P 500 once again is flirting with a breakout over its June 8 high of 3233. The other three distribution days in the S&P 500 show modest declines of 0.5% to 0.6%.

Still, with growth stocks under moderate selling pressure, it's not a bad time to consider trimming some of your big winners. The [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) portfolio has been lowering exposure by taking partial profits in some winners.


Bullish Sentiment Increases
---------------------------


The latest Investors Intelligence weekly survey of stock market newsletter writers showed a small rise in bullish sentiment to 58.1% after jumping to 57.7% the prior week. The latest reading is near the mid-January high of 59.4%. The S&P 500 pulled back 8.4% in January and another 12.5% in February.


According to Investors Intelligence, readings above 55% call for defensive measures, including tighter stops and trimming some of your big winners. Readings above 60% increase the chances for a market decline. In September 2018, the bulls hit 61.8% just ahead of sharp pullback for the S&P 500 in the first half of October.


IBD 50 Can't Keep Up
--------------------


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) lagged again, down less than 0.1%. It's down 2.7% so far this week, compared to a 1.3% weekly gain for the S&P 500 and a 0.6% decline for the Nasdaq composite.


**Zynex** ([ZYXI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZYXI)), **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) and **GSX Techedu** ([GSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSX)) took the biggest hits. Zynex slumped 14% to 22.48 after the company priced a 2.5 million-share offering at 22 each. The stock is testing support at its 50-day moving average for the first time after a breakout from a base in April.


[Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) trimmed Fortinet to a half position from full on June 29. Another quarter was trimmed on Monday and the remaining quarter position exited Wednesday. Fortinet had the look of a leader when it [gapped up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) powerfully in early May on earnings. But the narrative changed when Fortinet dived below its 50-day moving average Monday.


GSX Techedu fell for the fourth straight session and is testing support at the 10-day moving average.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


Leading growth stocks, meanwhile, continue to hold up well, with **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and Nvidia still holding above their 10-day lines. Biotech stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) and enterprise software leader **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) still look good after a solid test of their 50-day lines Tuesday. **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) bounced nicely off its 21-day moving average Tuesday.



The medical sector delivered three breakouts, and all three got discussion on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) during the first hour of trading. **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) topped a 601.31 entry, rising nearly 4% to 607.80.


**Catalent** ([CTLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTLT)), a member of the MarketSmith Growth 250, jumped 5.5% to 83.71. It's still in the 5% buy zone from the 80.62 entry. Group peer **Charles River Labs** ([CRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRL)) cleared a 189.95 entry, rising 3% to 193.45.

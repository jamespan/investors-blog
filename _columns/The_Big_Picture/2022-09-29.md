The stock market's fledgling rally attempt broke down as the stock market dived Thursday. The S&P 500 hit a new 2022 low, while the Nasdaq finished just above its June 16 low. Large-cap technology stocks were hit hard, with **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) all dropping.




Amid a stock market that continues to fall precipitously, new [IBD Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) is a stock market leader to watch.


Economic Data, Treasury Yields, Micron Earnings
-----------------------------------------------


The third estimate of second-quarter GDP showed second-quarter gross domestic product falling at a 0.6% annual rate. That is unchanged from the second estimate.


Meanwhile, the Labor Department's initial jobless claims fell to 193,000, lower than estimates that called for them to rise to 218,000, vs. 213,000 in the previous week, per Econoday. First-time unemployment claims remain sharply lower than the summer's 250,000 trend. The signs of continued strength in the [labor market](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/the-job-market-was-already-cooling-when-the-fed-panicked-heres-the-proof/) increase the chance of higher interest rates going into 2023.


The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up to 3.74% Thursday. On Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield briefly topped 4% before reversing sharply lower to close at 3.7%. The 10-year Treasury yield is tracking toward its ninth straight weekly advance, marking its longest rally since 2004.


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) and Dow Jones stock **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) reported their quarterly results after the close Thursday.


Micron shares fell about 1% in extended trade after [the company missed Wall Street's](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mu-stock-micron-posts-sales-miss-guides-low/) already lowered expectations for sales in its fiscal fourth quarter and guided much lower for the current quarter.

Stock Market Today: S&P 500 Hits New 2022 Lows
----------------------------------------------


On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sold off 1.5%, while the S&P 500 closed down 2.1%. The Nasdaq composite dived 2.8%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost nearly 2.4%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq undercut their recent lows, ending the young rally attempt.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MP092922-300x297.jpg)Volume fell on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session and also appeared to be lower on the NYSE.


Top growth stocks showed some resilience Thursday, as Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) fell 1.2%. The ETF is still holding above its recent 52-week low.


Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), energy stocks held up the best, as embattled oil names **Devon Energy** ([DVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVN)) and **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) gained 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively.


Chip giants Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia tumbled 6.2% and 4.1%. Apple sold off 4.9% on a Bank of America downgrade. BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan downgraded the stock from buy to neutral with a lowered price target of 160, saying he expects "material negative estimate revisions to be driven by weaker consumer demand."


Tesla skidded nearly 7% to fall further below its 50-day line.


Stock Market Rally Attempt Fails
--------------------------------


With the Nasdaq undercutting its Sept. 23 lows, the tech-heavy composite's two-day rally attempt fizzled out. Investors are now looking for another rally attempt. Amid the continued selling, investors should remain mostly, if not entirely, on the sidelines.


To prepare for a new stock market rally, investors should be waiting for two events: a rally attempt, then a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


After hitting a new low, look for a day when one of the major indexes closes higher. That might mean the index has stopped its decline, established a new "bottom" and is on its way to a rebound. But one up day isn't enough to tell if the market trend has truly changed. So we count that as Day 1 of an attempted rally. From there, as long as the index stays above the previous low, the attempted rally remains in place.


On Day 4 and later, you are looking for the Nasdaq or S&P 500 to rise sharply in higher volume than the previous session. That's a follow-through day. It gives investors the green light to start buying leading stocks breaking out past correct [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Nevertheless, it is important for investors to put this downtime to good use. Now is an ideal opportunity to [study market bottoms](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) and to [build a strong watchlist](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) of top-performing stocks. Many long-term leaders tend to break out at or near the follow-through day, the market-bottoming signal. Missing that early opportunity can be a costly mistake.

Vertex Is A Stock Market Leader
-------------------------------



Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a stock market leader to watch.


The new addition to [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) regained its 50-day line Wednesday and is still above it despite Thursday's market dive. In fact, the stock rose 0.1%. Shares are building a base-on-base pattern with a 306.05 buy point, according to [IBD MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. An early entry at 296.24 is also in play.


Per Leaderboard commentary, Vertex's June 8 breakout attempt from a cup with handle failed immediately when the stock plunged below its 50-day moving average the very next session. But higher volume in two up weeks in June indicates the possibility it remains a leader in 2022.


With a relative strength line at new highs, it is definitely a stock to watch right now. An [RS line at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) during a stock market correction is a key indicator of technical strength.


[In early August](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vrtx-stock-company-moving-into-new-field/), Vertex reported second-quarter earnings of $3.60 a share vs. expectations for $3.47, minus some items. In the year earlier period, Vertex earned only 17 cents a share. Second-quarter sales jumped 22% to $2.2 billion, topping estimates of $2.13 billion.


Trikafta, Vertex's biggest moneymaker, generated $1.89 billion in sales, rocketing 51% on a year-over-year basis. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that can treat 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis.


Meanwhile, **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)) and Vertex are working on a gene-editing drug for two blood diseases — beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.

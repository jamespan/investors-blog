Indexes Bounce As Some Leaders Find Support
============================================

The stock market bounced back Tuesday in a session that provided some encouraging signs.


The Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.7%, closing near session highs.


Small caps continued to lag by comparison as the Russell 2000 picked up 0.4%.


The Nasdaq's advance was not as well-rounded as the S&P 500's. Volume on the Nasdaq was lower, and advancing stocks topped decliners by a modest margin. On the NYSE, by comparison, winners topped losers by about 2 to 1 and volume increased.


But a lot of Nasdaq leading stocks found support at the 50-day moving average.


For chart readers, those price bounces indicated that there are institutions buying on the price dips, and shares should at least hold above those support levels.


**YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)),**Gentherm** ([THRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THRM)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) were some of the IBD 50 stocks that found support.


The IBD 50 on the whole was up a robust 1.6% â€” the best day since Aug. 4. The index also is finding support at its 50-day moving average.


While the indexes and leaders left a good aftertaste, one day's savory performance does not repair the broad market's sourness.


The uptrend is under pressure, having come under frequent distribution the past couple of weeks. The sum of the market's increases and declines in higher volume favors the bears.


Some leaders are still struggling or are rangebound, such as **Arris Group** ([ARRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARRS)), **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) and **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)).


A murky market makes it hard to trade some of the leaders like Gilead and **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)). Their charts have been wild lately, producing big shakeouts that at a minimum would test shareholders' nerves.


If the S&P 500 looks a bit sturdier, it's at least partly because of strength in sectors weighted more heavily in the index than on the Nasdaq.


Cyclicals such as mining, steel and transportation are leading the market. The Dow transportation average is up more than 15% this year, one of the best performances by a sector index.


Oil prices rebounded Tuesday, which helped energy stocks recover some of their losses.


For its part, the Nasdaq can count on strength from semiconductors and biotechs. The chip sector was No. 5 out of 33 sectors in Tuesday's IBD, up more than 14% since the start of the year.


Positive news from the FDA for **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ' ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) Eylea drug helped the stock rally 3% and gave the industry group a respite from more than a week of selling.


With its convincing gains, the market didn't seem apprehensive about Wednesday's policy statement from the Fed.


The worry on Wall Street is that the central bank may back away from its plan to keep interest rates near zero for a "considerable time."


In the past, any indication that a rate hike is on the horizon has spooked the market. That's what makes the Fed afternoon statement and Chairwoman Janet Yellen's press conference an anxious time.

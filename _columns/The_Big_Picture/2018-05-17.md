  Small Caps Sail Ahead, As Rest Of Market Hesitates

Small caps led the major indexes Thursday for a third straight session, continuing a trend that began in early April.




The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average each dropped 0.2% Thursday, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 gained 0.7%, up for the ninth time in the past 10 sessions.


Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq.


The stock market has seen a shift in leadership since the indexes pegged short-term lows April 2.


Since then, the S&P 600 is up 9%; the Nasdaq, 7%; the S&P 500, 5%; and the Dow, 4%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MP051718-245x300.jpg)News continued to be a force in the stock market, and a news-driven market is generally an unsure market.


Bulls much prefer to see earnings and stock fundamentals drive the market action.


On Thursday, President Trump supplied the news. Trump dampened hopes surrounding the trade talks with China.Â Trump told reporters that he doubted the trade talks would be successful.


"The reason I doubt it is because China has become very spoiled," Trump said. "Other countries have become very spoiled, because they always got 100% of whatever they wanted from the United States. But we can't allow that to happen anymore."


As usual, Trump's comments made for a hard read. With Trump, there's always the question: Did he mean what he said, or is it just another maneuver in the deal making he's known for?


Trump's remarks didn't do much damage to the stock indexes. The indexes kept their moves within a fairly narrow range.

Help For Banks
--------------


The stock market itself is a hard read right now, offering few clues on its next move.


One item that will come up for a vote next week in the House of Representatives is the Dodd-Frank legislation.


The House is expected to approve legislation trimming the government regulations on banks.


Superregional banks are expected to benefit, and the stocks have been rising. Stocks in the superregional group have risen almost 15% since the April 2 lows.


Superregionals that are basing and could eventually break out include **PNC Financial** ([PNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNC)), **Northern Trust** ([NTRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTRS)), **Comerica** ([CMA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMA)) and **SunTrust Banks** ([STI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STI)).


All are second stage, according to [MarketSmith's](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF) pattern-recognition technology.


A first- or second-stage breakout is more likely to work than a later stage breakout.


Few Stocks Break Out
--------------------


Breakouts were scarce Thursday. Some appeared to be head fakes.


For instance, **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) cleared a 199.98 buy point in the first half-hour of trade but then closed under the entry. Volume was average.


China-based e-commerce services provider **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) broke out in strong volume. The stock closed above a 52.43 buy point. The pattern, though, is third stage.


Franchise hotel operator **GreenTree Hospitality** ([GHG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GHG)), a late March initial public offering, broke out of an IPO base in strong volume.

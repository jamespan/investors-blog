Top-rated growth stocks rebounded Friday after recent bouts of selling, and stock market bulls got another day of picture-perfect price action in the major stock indexes. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 traded in orderly fashion all day, not moving much in either direction.




The Nasdaq added 0.3% Friday, ending the week just above its 10-day moving average. After Monday's nasty reversal and 2% haircut, the index fell 1.1% for the week. That's on the heels of an 8.8% gain the prior two weeks. The Nasdaq got turned away at an upper channel line Monday, but it would need to rally up to the 10,800 area to threaten the upper channel line again.


The S&P 500 also rose 0.3%. It's still poised to break above a June high at 3233. The Dow Jones fell 0.2% but marked its fourth straight close above its 200-day moving average. The Dow is also setting up for a possible breakout.


![MP071720](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP071720-252x300.jpg)Options expired Friday, and Nasdaq volume rose slightly. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in higher than Thursday.


Stock Market Leaders
--------------------


[Coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) stocks led the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). **Novavax** ([NVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVAX)), **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and **Innovio Pharmaceuticals** ([INO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INO)) ended with gains of 9.8% to 16.8%.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) ETF outperformed, rising 0.8%. Nearly half of the IBD 50 components rose at least 1%. But the ETF still had a tough week, down nearly 3%.



Five top-rated medical subgroups in IBD's database, including the [biotech group](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/biotech-and-pharma-industry-and-stock-news-merk-bristol-myers-amgn-gilead/), rose at least 2% and were among the day's best performers.


After a solid week of earnings, highlighted by strong reports from **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)), **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) and **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), the coming week is even busier.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) reports Tuesday after the close. The stock led the medical equipment group to a 3.6% gain. Intuitive followed through bullishly Friday after a breakout over a 601.30 buy point Wednesday.

Results from **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), featured in the latest [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/chipotle-stock-weathers-coronavirus-pandemic-holds-near-highs/) column, are due Wednesday after the close. Chipotle stock broke out powerfully over a 1,087.10 buy point on July 6 and has been moving sideways since then.


Top Software Stocks
-------------------


Leading software stocks have come under pressure of late. But new opportunities in the sector could arise if group leaders come down to their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) and find support. That's why enterprise software leaders like **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)), **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) and **Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)) should be put on a watchlist.


**ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) gave alternate entries this week with support at their 10-week lines. Support for Dynatrace was solidified by a close in the upper half of its weekly range.

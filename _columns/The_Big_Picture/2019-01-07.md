Investors apparently did not get enough in stocks after Friday's huge rally, adding broadly to the major stock indexes just one day after a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) signified a new market uptrend may be underway. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), meanwhile, rebounded sharply enough to become the largest company on U.S. exchanges in market value.




The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.3% on Monday while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.4%. Small caps led the way, as the Russell 2000 jumped 1.8%. Market volume eased, but barely so. Advancing stocks led decliners by 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE.


The Nasdaq has climbed as much as 10.7% from the Christmas Eve low, and the S&P 500 as much as 9.4% from the Dec. 26 low. That's already better than the rebounds from late October to early December. So for now, investors can regard the current rebound as a good sign.


The downside is that it leaves indexes vulnerable to a normal pullback. That's something to keep in mind as investors seek to increase exposure.


Note These Price Levels
-----------------------


Looking at the index charts, the 2600 level stands as a key level for the S&P 500 to beat. For the Nasdaq, the 6900 to 7000 level appears to be a major marker. Indexes found support around those prices in the last few months of 2018 and they now represent potential resistance ceilings.


While indexes are steaming higher, there are still few [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) among top-rated stocks. To borrow a military term, it's not a target-rich environment.


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) provided one [successful breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) Monday after the collaboration software company made a solid move back above a 89.92 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Atlassian is somewhat of a bellwether for the new market rally because it was the one standout stock with a [properly crafted cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) during the late-2018 bear market.


**Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) and new issue **I3 Verticals** ([IIIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIIV)) also broke out Monday. Volume in Dollar General was below average, however. Discount chains that rival Dollar General also rose on news that [an activist fund owns a stake in **Dollar Tree**](https://www.investors.com/news/starboard-dollar-tree-urges-family-dollar-sale-raise-prices/) ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and is urging a strategic shift. It's the main reason the discount and variety store industry group was Monday's second best, up more than 5%.


A shortage of breakouts doesn't necessarily mean leading stocks are acting badly. The IBD 50 jumped 2.2% on Monday, with three stocks up 7% or more and 13 others up 3% to 7%.


The [average IBD 50 stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) remains more than 16% below a 52-week high. Yet, several are approaching [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), including **Five9** ([FIVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVN)), **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)).


Morgan Stanley on Monday raised Five9 and Five Below to overweight from equal weight. The investment bank lifted Five9's price target to 54 from 37 and Five Below's target to 118 from 113.


Leading Sectors And Laggards Since Christmas
--------------------------------------------


The market rally that began around Christmas is enjoying broad participation. All major S&P sector are up, to varying degrees. ETFs tracking retail, consumer discretionary and energy sectors are up more than 10%. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)), which bucked much of the bear market, is up only 3%.


Energy stocks were one of Monday's best performers after the Wall Street Journal said [Saudi Arabia plans to make deeper cuts to oil exports](https://www.investors.com/news/crude-oil-prices-us-china-trade-talks-china-trade-war/). U.S. crude was up 1.6% to $48.72 a barrel late Monday.


Retail was the day's top sector, thanks in part to the strength in discount stores. But Amazon.com also contributed, rising more than 3% as it climbed back above the 50-day moving average. It is still 20% below a new high.


Pivotal Research initiated coverage on Amazon.com with a [price target of 1,920 and a buy rating](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-stock-analyst-report/). Amazon.com closed at 1,629.51, which gave the stock a market capitalization of $796.78 billion, according to IBD's database. That makes Amazon the largest company by market cap, dethroning **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)).


Trade Talks And Q4 Earnings Results Loom
----------------------------------------


On Monday, U.S. and Chinese negotiators began talks on trade tariffs. The meetings are aimed at ending an impasse on trade that has undermined China's economy and has hurt certain U.S. industries. Trade is one of the [main issues clouding the stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-forecast-for-2019/) in the new year.


Earnings season is on the horizon, and it looms as a key period for all investors. On an aggregate basis, the S&P 500 is expected to report earnings growth of 11.4% for the fourth quarter, according to FactSet. That would be the fifth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth. But it also would be a sharp slowdown from the past three quarters, when S&P 500 earnings gains topped 20%.

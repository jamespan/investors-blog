Nasdaq, Dow Go Separate Ways; Stock Rotation Underway

U.S. stock indexes posted mixed results Thursday, as tech stocks yanked down the Nasdaq and infrastructure and bank plays lifted the NYSE.


The Nasdaq fell 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2% and 1.2%, respectively. The small-cap S&P 600 rushed ahead 1.9%. The IBD 50 lagged with a 1.1% loss.


![mp110416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MP110416-1-132x300.png)Volume in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) rose on both major exchanges.


The action in the Nasdaq was bad enough to slap a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735759&sourceid=735764) on the composite. Although the uptrend resumed Wednesday, the indexes are carrying a heavy load of distribution.


This means the market is vulnerable to a sudden switch. Megacap internet tech stocks were the force behind the Nasdaq's dent Thursday. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) each dropped sharply in fast trade. Those stocks alone account for 31% of the weighting in the Nasdaq, including the Alphabet Class C shares.


Meanwhile, the Dow got a concentrated boost from a few stocks: **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) popped 5%; **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) gained 4.5%; **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) leapt 4%; and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)), poppedÂ 3.5%.


Together, the exit from the internet and tech stocks, along with the shift to banks and other plays, point to sector rotation. Yes, IBM is a tech stock, but currently [it's more of a turnaround play](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/what-would-it-take-to-wake-up-ibms-slumping-stock/) than a growth stock.


The beneficiaries of the Trump rotation are bank and infrastructure stocks, so far. Individual investors should get exposure to the strengthening niches, if they haven't already. Do not be tempted to argue with the trend.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *The toughest part of investing intelligently is [following the rules when the pressure is on](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-sticking-to-rules-is-true-challenge/).*

Bank stocks are benefiting from the likelihood of a rate hike in December, which CME Group's FedWatch Tool puts at 71%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield is above 2% for the first time since January as yields have leapt since the election results.


Another factor also could help banks. President-elect Donald Trump said on the campaign trail that he favors dismantling the Dodd-Frank law, which many see as an unnecessary drag on bank performance.


The stock market's Trump effect is being credited with a surge in copper prices, though that suggests that copper traders predicted Trumps' electoral victory. Copper began rising Oct. 24 and then picked up price momentum. Barclays iPath Copper ([JJC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JJC)) exchange traded fund rose in 13 of the past 14 sessions.


Copper is regarded as a general economic indicator because of its uses in many industrial applications. The recent rise could be either anticipatory or related to infrastructure or both. The heavy volume in iPath Copper argues against a merely technical bounce.


The individual investor can play this current uptrend, if he or she follows two rules: Don't buy stocks that are extended more than 5% beyond the ideal buy point, and be aware that the market uptrend could unravel quickly. Ideally, bulls would like to see a [follow-through-like](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735761&sourceid=735764) day in the Nasdaq or the S&P 500. Such a move would act as a confirmation signal as indexes seek new highs.

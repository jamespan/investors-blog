Nasdaq Sells Off Again, But Dow Jones Up; Will Value Stocks Beat Growth?

Is Nasdaq 12,000 the new Dow 10,000?




Way back in March 1999, when central banks across the world fretted over the potential Y2K computer glitch issue and investors large and small chased dot.com startups that had wimpy sales and no earnings, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied past the 10,000 mark for the first time in history. Floor traders on the NYSE celebrated the milestone with hats and goofy spectacles. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average kept going higher.


Yet after peaking at 11,750 in January of 2000, the blue-chip index fell together with other major indexes after the mighty Nasdaq tech bubble burst. By late 2002, the Dow 30 did not collapse in the same way that the Nasdaq went from a peak of 5132 at the time to a low of 1108, down 78%. But the Dow did fall to as low as 7197, down 39% from its 2000 peak. It took a couple years before the Dow industrials rallied back above 10,000 â€” and stayed above it for good.


In 2020, the Nasdaq reached a small milestone of its own. After the coronavirus bear market bottom in March, the tech-fortified composite index made a stunning move. Months after its own [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on April 6, the Nasdaq climbed all the way to new all-time highs. On Sept. 2, it closed above 12,000 for the first time.



MP111020_2The Nasdaq's Nasty Reversal
-------------------------------------


Yet as a daily chart shows, 12,000 has served as a harsh resistance level. IBD-style investors certainly felt it on Monday, when the index climbed as much as 1.8% early, headed for a sixth straight advance. But a 1.5% drop in higher volume and Tuesday's 1.4% sell-off in above-average turnover made it clear that large fund managers sold into the rally.


In terms of market internals, the Nasdaq's session wasn't totally awful.


Winning issues actually outmatched losers by a nearly 3-2 margin on Tuesday.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 bounced nicely off session lows, turning a 1.1% early slide into a 0.1% blemish.


Volume fell sharply on the NYSE vs. the prior session, when volume surged. But make no mistake: Turnover was heavy on both main exchanges.


The Nasdaq is not necessarily going to repeat today what U.S. equities did nearly two decades ago. In the short term, the Nasdaq remains above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). And the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) offered buying support on Tuesday.


But the past two sessions indicate institutional investors may be showing less of a hunger for high-priced technology companies and more of a thirst for beaten-down industrial, financial, old-school energy and retail firms.


Beyond Nasdaq: Growth Taking Back Seat To Value?
------------------------------------------------


Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management, told IBD in an interview that he's advised clients to boost exposure in financial and industrial companies. When the economy is coming out of a recession, value stocks tend to do better than growth for a several reasons. Cyclical companies tend to benefit from the economic expansion. They're also trading more cheaply.


"Banks put a ton of money into loan loss provisions. We think they've hit the max," Goldman said. "We're seeing it everywhere, in large banks, superregionals. From a valuation standpoint, they trade more cheaply than during the Great Recession (of 2008). And the Federal Reserve's stress tests have shown the banks are in better shape."


On Tuesday, the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) exchange traded fund skidded 1.5% lower, cutting gains for the fourth quarter to nearly 2.4%. But iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) rose almost 1.2% to a nine-month high. IWD has advanced 9.7% since Oct. 1.

Boeing Stock Comeback
---------------------


Among transport-related stocks, **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)), which stormed nearly 14% higher in the heaviest turnover in months on Monday, added an additional 5% on Tuesday. [Regulators may soon approve the 737 Max for a return to service](https://www.investors.com/news/boeing-737-faa-return-to-service-boeing-orders-deliveries-october-2020/). For at least a day, the struggling jet, satellite and missile maker closed above its steadily falling 200-day moving average. Its two-day rise helped the Dow industrials add nearly 3% over the past two sessions and mark the highest close since Feb. 13.



On Tuesday, [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) showed that at least three dozen industry groups among the 197 covered each day jumped 3% or more. They ranged from gas distribution, tobacco, water supply and oil and gas transport to RVs, Midwest banks, mortgage REITs, cement, paints and drugstore chains. (See the daily performance of all 197 industry groups at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Is GM A New Stock Market Leader?
--------------------------------



**General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) is trying to engineer a big turnaround, and investors seem to favor its recent efforts to expand its offerings in the EV (electric vehicle) space. GM stock has risen more than 22% since clearing a 33.43 buy point.


More money appears to be rotating into **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Booking Holdings** ([BNKG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNKG)), **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)), **Hyatt** ([H](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=H)) and **Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)). A few more turnaround plays got covered in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A). Keep in mind that turnarounds typically do not feature excellent IBD ratings all around at the start of their new rallies. But their [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) should be shooting higher.



**Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)), a fast-growing expert in testing systems for integrated circuits, ended its six-day win streak. Shares fell 3% to 98.15 in light trade. That left the large cap just beyond the 5% buy zone after it broke out of a [classic cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 93.27 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


**Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) fell 9% in accelerating volume. A two-session slide sent the videoconferencing platform down nearly 20% below its still-rising 50-day moving average.

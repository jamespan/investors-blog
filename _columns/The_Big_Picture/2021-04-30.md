After Big Week Of Earnings, Stock Market Eases; Why Indexes Are Moderating
===========================================================================

After the most important week of first-quarter earnings reports, the stock market came through with little change. For now, this is a market investors can live with, if not fully embrace.




Broad losses Friday eroded moderate gains from earlier in the week. That left the Nasdaq and S&P 500 nearly flat for the week.


On Friday, the Nasdaq fell 0.9% and the S&P 500 lost 0.7%. Small caps reversed lower for the week, with the Russell 2000 off 1.3% on Friday.


Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume fell, so the indexes avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


![MP043021](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MP043021-268x300.jpg)There was no clear explanation for the selling. Institutional investors tend to make portfolio adjustments at the end of the month, and perhaps they took the occasion to lock in some profits.


At any rate, indexes have been moderating the past couple of weeks. This, after the S&P 500 climbed four straight weeks and the Nasdaq mounted its own April rally.


Curiously, the Nasdaq peaked as it tested the Feb. 16 record high of 14,175. That makes it the Nasdaq's next key crossing. The S&P 500 was as much as 6% above its 50-day moving average when it started to slow on April 16. The index continues to have a wide gap above its 50-day average.


Certainly, the stock market had reason to be nervous, with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) reporting quarterly results all in the same week.


In The Stock Market: Megacap Techs Mixed After Earnings
-------------------------------------------------------


The six largest Nasdaq companies beat expectations, although the stock market treated their results differently. Facebook and Alphabet gapped up. Amazon.com neared new highs but reversed lower Friday. Tesla faded from a potential [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 780.89, though it bounced near the 50-day line. Microsoft gapped down.


Apple was primed to break out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) when it [soundly beat profit and sales expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-hits-buy-point-but-cautious-outlook-softens-gains/) late Wednesday. But after a cautious outlook, Apple wasn't able to hold above the 135.63 buy point of its cup with handle. The stock fell more Friday on news that [the EU filed antitrust charges](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-news-eu-watchdog-files-antitrust-charges/).


April [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in many other leading stocks also struggled, including **Veeco Instruments** ([VECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VECO)), **Azek** ([AZEK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZEK)), **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), **Vizio** ([VZIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZIO)) and **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)). That goes with the stock market's moderation. But until more signs of deterioration appear, investors have no reason to flee stocks.


Finding immediate winners is harder. **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) and **Staar Surgical** ([STAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STAA)) are doing better from their breakouts.


Day's Biggest Movers
--------------------


Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by 2-1 on the Nasdaq and NYSE Friday. While losses were broad, defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate closed modestly higher. Consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors also closed higher.


Energy was the poorest sector after the price of U.S. crude oil fell more than 2% to $63.53 late Friday. Solar stocks were near the bottom of Friday's 197 industry groups. In technology, semiconductors were the weakest part of the sector.

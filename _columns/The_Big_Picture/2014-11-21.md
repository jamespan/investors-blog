Stocks staged a negative reversal Friday, a day after doing the exact opposite.

  

The Nasdaq settled for a 0.2% gain after being up 1.1% early. The S&P 500 pocketed 0.5% of its early 0.9% pop.

  

The IBD 50 ended flat.

  

Volume ran higher across the board. Friday was an expirations day, which tends to lift volume.

  

Friday's bearish chart action contradicted Thursday's bullish pattern. On Thursday, the indexes opened down and then wiped out the losses. On Friday, the indexes started with a jump and then bled much of the gains away throughout the session.

  

Together, the two days might have left the technical-oriented investor scratching his or her head.

  

Is the action bullish or bearish?

  

For IBD-style investors, the answer isn't blowing in the contradictory winds of two sessions. It's found in the distribution-day count.

  

The count remains relatively low, despite Friday's negative action. The Nasdaq showed stalling Friday; but the stalling formula, which is complicated, didn't lead to a change in the distribution day count.

  

Overall, conditions remain bullish, and IBD-style investors should look for buy opportunities if they aren't fully invested.

  

News and economic data gave a lift to stocks, but the broad gains narrowed to a more selective lift as the session wore on.

  

China's central bank provided the early fuel. The central bank cut interest rates. Meanwhile, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi hinted at more stimulus.

  

Stocks rallied but later gave back most of their easy gains. The issues that kept the early gains were mostly in the construction, mining, steel and oil industry groups â€” in other words, commodity-tied stocks.

  

China is trying to become more of a consumer-based economy, but the market apparently still slaps a commodity and heavy-industry label on the nation.

  

**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) broke out of a double-bottom-with-handle base in strong volume and kept most of its early gains.

  

Most stocks that benefited Friday from the China interest-rate card were stocks far off their highs, low rated and in laggard groups.

  

Among top-rated stocks, the action was more mixed, though it too had a China tilt.

  

On the upside, the breakouts included China-based wealth manager **Noah Holdings** ([NOAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOAH)); Brazil meat and foods provider **BRF** ([BRFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRFS)) (China is Brazil's top trading partner); and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) (store count in China was 823 as of September, up 34% from the year-earlier period).

  

Starbucks' chart reflects a delayed-volume breakout. The stock showed no volume when it cleared the 77.77 buy point Nov. 7 or in any of the following sessions. However, big volume kicked in Friday as the stock gapped up 1.56 to 79.76 in volume 57% above average.

  

On the downside, home-furnishing retailers **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) and **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) fell 3% and 5% respectively in heavy volume.

  

The negative action came a day after Restoration's break above an alternative buy point and Williams-Sonoma's intraday breakout.

  

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.2%, the Nasdaq 0.5% and the IBD 50 0.4%.

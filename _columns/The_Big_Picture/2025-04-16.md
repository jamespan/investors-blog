Pick virtually any stock market gauge. Even before Wednesday's bear-style mauling, investors would have been justified to hold a heavy dose of skepticism regarding the fledgling rebound. Yet for now, the potential for a tradable rally still hasn't died.


The Nasdaq composite slumped nearly 3.1% lower to 16,307, 19.3% below its all-time summit of 20,204. Remarkably, the index notched its seventh day of 2% losses or more for the seventh time since March 26. At its recent April 7 low of 14,784, the tech-driven index slid nearly 27% from its 20,204 all-time peak set on Dec. 16.




The S&P 500 slumped 2.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7%. Stock market breadth tilted negatively, with losers outweighing winners by more than 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq and 9-to-5 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Russell 2000 lost 1%. Volume rose mildly vs. Tuesday on both main exchanges.


Stock Market Today: The Sitting Strategy
----------------------------------------


For those who prefer to make money going long on stocks, it would seem rational to want to try to get into a budding stock market rally as quickly as possible. But until the stock market receives a true confirmation, almost always in the form of a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/), the discipline for investors to sit on their hands really pays off.


So, naturally, the current outlook still calls for minimal exposure to the stock market at 0%-20%. This red flag for active investors has remained in place since March 26, when IBD's recommended exposure got cut to the current level from 20%-40%.


Before Wednesday's lurch lower, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500, New York Stock Exchange composite, Russell 2000 and S&P SmallCap 600 all lay beneath their falling [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). Investors seeking an edge while going long in stocks tend to perform much better when the exact opposite occurs.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MP041625.jpg)That is, the 21-day line — typically drawn in green on the Investor's Business Daily  [MarketSurge daily charts](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) that are presented on ["IBD Live"](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?_gl=1*t1n365*_gcl_au*NDAzMjM1NjE4LjE3NDE2MzUwMDAuNzQ1OTMwOTcwLjE3NDQ2NTM0MjUuMTc0NDY1MzQyNQ..*_ga*NjQwNzY3OTk3LjE3MzQ2MTc4Mzc.*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0NDgzMjE4NC41NDAuMS4xNzQ0ODM3MjkyLjYwLjAuMA..&id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) each day — should be rising, not sinking. And at least one or two stock market indexes, ideally more, should be trading above their 21-day lines and even lifting them skyward.


Until such a positive technical trend emerges, investors who keep their powder dry will likely feel like winners. When the trend is not a friend, fighting against it can turn quite costly.


The White House gave techs a black eye on Wednesday with [additional measures to hamper China's buildup of its tech economy](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-falls-trump-curbs-china-ai-chip-sales/).


The iShares Semiconductor ([SOXX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXX)) exchange traded fund fell 3.9%, even though it closed well off its session lows. From here, the iShares fund would need to rally at least 7% just to test a potential overhead supply of sellers near the exchange traded fund's 21-day line. Further, the fund bears a weak 22 Relative Strength Rating on a scale of 1 to 99.


Later in the day, stocks saw their sell-off deepen as traders listened closely to a Q&A with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of Chicago. Powell acknowledged that the persistent rise in the level of federal debt is "on an unsustainable path."


Still, that comment did not stop investors from rushing back into Treasury bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note sank 4 basis points to 4.27%.

As Wednesday's stock market action illustrated, even fundamental leaders within relatively unscathed sectors danced on banana peels.


**Abbott Laboratories** ([ABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABT)), a focal point of discussion on Wednesday's "IBD Live" show, gained more than 1%. But as a daily chart shows, the medical device and products titan finished well off its session high of 134.16.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) for Abbott Labs looks fine and has been rising for months. A double-bottom base is taking shape, as with so many other highly rated growth stocks. Abbott tried to clear a 133.64 entry on Wednesday, but the breakout attempt looked premature. Only six weeks have passed since the megacap health care play began etching the base on its chart.


So, do Abbott and other current leaders need more time to post a genuine breakout? Very likely so.


Elsewhere, investor psychology remains depressed.

Bulls remained in the shadow of the bears, at least from the vantage point of the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers and other stock market pundits. Bullishness last week plunged to 23.6% of all stock market experts surveyed.


That marked the lowest level since at least March 2018. This week, the bulls edged up to 25.9% Yet so did bearishness, rising to 35.2% from 34.6%. Only four months ago, back in December, bullish views commanded the stock market at 62.9%.


Typically, when the bull ratio spikes above 60%, it flags the potential for a top in the overall stock market. Yet not all sectors fall at once. They take their turns, helping to make it more difficult to spot a stock market top.


One Hot Sector
--------------


Gold mining plays don't want to seem to take their turn in the sell-off.


While the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) is now up 3.2% for the week, the slope of its rise seems to be kicking it up a notch. While that's great news for gold investors, the technical action hints at optimism reaching frothy levels. When everyone has bought something and setting bullish emojis to their friends and family members, what's left to buy?



Certainly, gold mining stocks have given IBD readers multiple opportunities to cash in on gold fever.


Just a week ago, **AngloGold Ashanti** ([AU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AU)) already turned a tidy 25% profit when shares surpassed a [large double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) that revealed a 31.46 proper entry. In both February and March, the U.K.-based miner weathered pullbacks to the 10-week moving average with class. But on top of last week's strong gains, the rally is starting to look a bit parabolic. Selling at least some shares into strength is an important sell rule.


Will These Sector Improve?
--------------------------


Looking at the daily performance of IBD's 197 industry groups, another sector stood out on the plus side: oil and gas. Crude futures enjoyed a firm 2% gain, and on the Nymex, prices reached as high as $62.31 a barrel. However, most oil stocks still look broken and need time to repair.


For instance, the international oil and gas exploration group rallied 1.7% on a price-weighted basis. But members such as **Hess** ([HES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HES)) and **ConocoPhillips** ([COP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COP)) have tumbled recently. Both stocks recently crashed below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

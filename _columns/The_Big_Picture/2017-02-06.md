Stocks Post Meager Losses; Facebook, Amazon Breakouts Still In Peril
=====================================================================

The stock market eased Monday, a minor step back that kept the market on a mildly positive path.


The S&P 500 retreatedÂ 0.2% while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%. Small caps, though, were hammered for a 0.8% loss in the Russell 2000. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and NYSE.


All indexes are trading near highs, and conditions remain proper for increasing exposure to stocks. Yet, there's a sense of unease as investors watch breakout after breakout but relatively little profit from those entries.


![mp020617](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MP020617-230x300.png)Stocks up 5% or a bit more from entries are centered in the tech sector. Those include **KLA Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)), **Silicon Laboratories** ([SLAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLAB)), **Logitech** ([LOGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGI)), **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) and mortgage insurer **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)). In today's market, that's considered a success. Runaway winners are rare.


While indexes are near records, they haven't reached those shores the same way. The S&P 500 has met resistance at the 2300 level for more than a week and its trajectory since mid-December has been more or less sideways. The same can be said of the Dow. The Russell 2000 is still in a consolidation pattern.


But the Nasdaq has been trending moderately higher. It has emerged as the leading index by about doubling the S&P's gain in 2017 thus far.


The Nasdaq is winning despite that many of its flagship stocks such as **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), Alphabet, Intel and Amazon.com are floundering from breakouts. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), however, are other major components that are doing well from their most recent buy points.


If not from its heavyweights, where is the tech-heavy Nasdaq getting its strength?


Semiconductor, data storage, software and some medical industry groups are up roughly 6% to 12% so far this year. To be sure, groups with small representation in the Nasdaq such as mining, steel and oil have done even better.


In the new highs list, the Nasdaq's advantage also shows up. Regional banks and chip stocks continue to account for large numbers.


But in general, financials did not follow through on Friday's rally. Banking, insurance and other groups in the sector were flat or down as much as 1%.


The sector seemed to be hurt by uncertainty emerging in Europe. In France, center-right front-runner Francois Fillon is slipping while candidate Marine Le Pen, who wants to break from the euro, is gaining momentum. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's re-election bid now seems like a tough contest.


Domestically, Goldman Sachs expressed reservations about President Trump's ability to carry out key policies, including the repeal of ObamaCare, and trade and immigration moves that may disrupt financial markets and the economy.


The Energy sector was one of the weakest despite a meager drop of 0.1% in U.S. crude to $53.77 a barrel. Retail and some medical industry groups also were among the weakest. The IBD 50 was flat.

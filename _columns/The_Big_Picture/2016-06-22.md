The major U.S. indexes frittered away moderate early gains to end mildly lower Wednesday. That perhaps surprised nobody on the eve of Britain's referendum on its status within the EU.


The Nasdaq's early gain of 0.7% crumbled into a loss of just more than 0.2%. The S&P 500 lost slightly less than 0.2%. Small caps sank a little more, with the S&P SmallCap 600 down more than 0.4%. Volume fell on both major exchanges.


![MP062216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MP062216.jpg)Despite the unsavory reversal, overall market conditions hardly changed.


Consider the Nasdaq composite. For the seventh time in eight sessions, the index finished the day in between its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. While that may sound like an overly technical factoid, the point is clear: Large equity investors are sitting on the sidelines. When these players are not taking big positions long or short, the market's trend gets cloudy fast.


The May 17 distribution day fell off the count due to time. As seen in the Market Pulse table, the lower distribution count points to a pause in heavy institutional selling. However, the uptrend still has the feel of being under pressure, so an investor still benefits by having an ample amount of cash in the portfolio to shield against any further price downside.


The message from leading stocks continues to be murky.


While newer companies such as **Dave & Buster's** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)) have performed well in recent months, solid breakouts to new highs are still wafer-thin. If it weren't for defensive sectors such as real estate investment trusts, food and beverage, and utilities, the new high list may be a lot smaller than it is today.


Lately, IBD's [screen](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-june-21-2016-2/) showed 120 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange hitting 52-week or all-time highs, the first triple-digit figure since June 10. On the Nasdaq, the number of stocks making new highs has hung in the range of 30 to 60 in most of the past nine sessions.


Despite the declines among the key indexes, bargain hunters propped up drug and biotech stocks. Hospital, drugstore, investment banking, gaming, travel booking, railroad and ship stocks also landed gains of 0.5% or higher as a group.


Polling places across Britain are slated to close at 5 p.m. ET Thursday, with the first actual results not expected to begin until 7:30 p.m. While it's true that in the short term some industries would get an immediate hit on their business if the U.K. exited the EU, trade agreements could be later signed between the two sides in much the same way it's done between Switzerland and the region.


Meanwhile, Edison Group investment strategist Alastair George of the U.K. perhaps said it best about the media frenzy surrounding "Brexit," calling it an "alarming demonstration of the fragility of the current global economic system that a nation accounting for 2.4% of world GDP with perhaps 10% of that volume at risk from Brexit -- or 0.24% of world GDP -- can trigger such large gyrations in global markets."


Ironically, some of the biggest British corporations -- from **BP** ([BP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BP)) to **GlaxoSmithKline** ([GSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSK)) to **HSBC Holdings** ([HSBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSBC)) -- have rebounded sharply so far this week. But the average [IBD Composite Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-h-s-b-c-holdings-plc-adr-hsbc.aspx) for this trio is a wretched 39. True stock market leaders tend to show a composite rank of 95 or better. Investors should perhaps be most concerned about what steps Britain's government will take to boost its economy. GDP growth slowed in 2015, and stocks in London reflect a slowing expansion.


The O'Neil All United Kingdom index has been in a funk since its July 4, 2014, peak. Today it lies 16.4% below that high. The S&P 500 is 2% below its peak of 2,134.

Stock Market Shows More Strength After Inflation Data; Cadence Design, Arista Networks, GFS Join Breakout Ranks
================================================================================================================

The prospect of more interest rates hikes — and rates staying higher for longer — rattled the stock market for a while Tuesday as Wall Street weighed the latest report on inflation. But the market uptrend showed strength once again as major stock indexes pared early losses or reversed higher, and closed near session highs.




[Consumer prices](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-comes-in-hot-keeping-fed-on-guard-sp-500/) increased 0.5% in January, up from a revised 0.1% in December. Year over year, prices rose 6.4%. That was slightly above the 6.2% consensus but below December's reading of 6.5%.


Core prices rose 0.4%, flat from December but a little above the 0.3% consensus. Year over year, core prices increased 5.6%, just above the 5.5% consensus but also below December's reading of 5.7%.


The 10-year Treasury yield rallied nearly 8 basis points to 3.80% after the data, but the yield cooled down by the close. Just after 4 p.m. ET, the 10-year yield was trading around 3.75%.


Higher interest rates weighed on the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ([ITB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITB)). But the fund rallied off lows and closed in the top half of its intraday range.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The stock market didn't quite know how to react to the inflation data at first as stock indexes opened lower but rebounded during the first 45 minutes of trading. The Nasdaq composite rallied as much as 0.9%, stopping just short of the 12,000 level. Sellers knocked the Nasdaq lower from there, but buyers soon regained the upper hand. The Nasdaq closed with a gain of 0.6% in higher volume, although declining stocks had a slight edge over advancers.

The S&P 500 pared a 1% midday loss to less than 0.1%. Volume also rose on the NYSE, with losers having a slight edge over winners.


S&P 500 component **Cadence Design Systems** ([CDNS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDNS)) gapped out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 192.02 entry, fueled by a strong earnings report and bullish guidance. With semiconductor stocks outperforming, it makes sense that Cadence is also doing well. The company's design tools are used in the design and simulation of integrated circuits. CDNS is an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/).


Group peer **Synopsys** ([SNPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNPS)) cleared an alternative buy point of 374.75 ahead of Wednesday's earnings report after the close.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) also outperformed in the S&P 500, up 5.4%. But after six straight weekly gains, and another taking shape this week, it's best to wait for a low-volume pullback. Also, the company will report earnings Feb. 22. If a handle forms, it could easily yield a new entry. After several higher-volume price gains, Nvidia is making the case it still has the potential to be a stock market leader.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged lower by 0.5%. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) was a top gainer in the blue-chip index. BA stock reclaimed a 216.74 entry after the company said it delivered 38 planes in January, most of them 737 Max jets. Boeing also won a massive order from Air India for at least 220 planes worth $34 billion.


Rate-Hike Expectations
----------------------


The new report on inflation didn't do much to sway the outlook for Fed policy. Quarter-point rate hikes in March in May are pretty much baked in. But the odds of a third quarter-point hike in June are now close to 55% from just below 50% before the CPI data.


With the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) still light, and the market tide still flowing positive, stock market exposure between 60% and 80% still makes sense. [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) is just over 80% invested, including the **Allegro Microsystems** ([ALGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGM)) call option with a 35 strike price that expires Friday. Along with **Axcelis Technologies** ([ACLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACLS)) and **Aehr Test Systems** ([AEHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEHR)), ALGM has emerged as a big leader in the semiconductor sector.


When it comes to new buys, look for stocks breaking out of bases — like ALGM did on Jan. 26. But be careful buying stocks that have run up a lot without much consolidation. And don't be afraid to buy pullbacks. **MercadoLibre**'s ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) first buy signal was on Jan. 12. After a shallow pullback, MELI gave another buy signal Tuesday when it pulled back to the top of a prior consolidation with a 1095.44 entry.


Tuesday's session delivered plenty of strong movers.



Chipmaker **GlobalFoundries** ([GFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFS)) jumped out of a cup base with a 69.40 entry after [earnings and revenue](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/gfs-stock-globalfoundries-exceeds-q4-goals/) topped expectations. GFS guided Q1 profit and revenue mostly in line with expectations, but the midpoint for the bottom line and the top line was above estimates.

After giving an early buy signal Monday, **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) extended gains and cleared a cup-with-handle base. Shares jumped 4.6%, closing just above a 169.04 entry ahead of next week's earnings report.


**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), meanwhile, surged out of a cup base after delivering another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth. The provider of cloud networking solutions counts **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) among its top customers.


After a three-session pullback, **Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) reversed higher and marked an outside day, rising just over 5%. It reclaimed a 34.43 buy point.

Bears swatted the stock indexes hard Friday, as the market reacted badly to Britain's looming exit from the European Union.


The Nasdaq collapsed 4.1%, its biggest one-day dent in five years. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average slumped 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. The IBD 50 lost 3.4%.


Volume rose, boosted in part by the annual Russell index rebalancing.


The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both slashed under their 50-day moving averages, and the Nasdaq took out the 200-day line as well.

IBD's market outlook is right back to uptrend under pressure, which requires investors to take a defensive stance.


What can the individual investor make of this market?


-- Relative strength: Domestic stocks generally did better Friday than those with international exposure. Also, U.S. indexes didn't lose as much as key indexes in Europe and Japan. The Euro Stoxx 50, which reflects Europe's largest and most liquid stocks, plunged 8.6%. Japan's Nikkei 225 dived 7.9%.


-- A boxed-in Fed? The Federal Reserve is expected to delay a rate hike in light of global uncertainty. If this is so, look for utilities to do well. **Consolidated Edison** ([ED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ED)) jumped 2% Friday in heavy volume, clearing a consolidation. **Southern Co.** ([SO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SO)) topped the 51.50 buy point of its base but closed under the entry.


-- Is it almost over? The put/call volume ratio is signaling a bottom. The ratio closed at 1.17, above the 1.15 level often reached near a short-term bottom.


-- Precedents for severe declines exist, but will the market follow them? In the past two years, the Nasdaq lost 3% to 3.8% six times. The Nasdaq often pegged a low one to seven sessions later. But Friday's loss was 4.1%, a bit sharper.


The last time the Nasdaq sank at least 4% was August 2011: On Aug. 4, the Nasdaq slid 5.1%, then 6.9% on Aug. 8 and 5.2% on Aug. 18. Yet those losses were bigger than Friday's fall.


The precedent of the past two years would suggest the market is near at least a short-term bottom. The precedent of 2011 would suggest this could get uglier.


-- A bad bet: The bookies insisted Britain would vote to stay in the EU. They said voters would back away from the bold move at the last minute, which normally happens. The overlooked factor: These aren't normal times.


Last word: Focus on weekly charts to make less frenetic decisions. And stick to sell rules.


For the week, the Nasdaq carved off 1.9%; the S&P 500, 1.6%; and the IBD 50, 1.3%.

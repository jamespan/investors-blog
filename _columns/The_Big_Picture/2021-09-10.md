Stock Market Extends Its Slow Descent; These Signs Point To Weakening Market
=============================================================================

The stock market closed lower Friday and at session lows, adding to a weakening trend slowly building in the major indexes.




The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9% and the S&P 500 lost 0.8%, the latter's fifth straight loss. Both indexes closed at session lows for a second day in a row, a symptom of the flabby action in the stock market since it hit record highs.


The size of Friday's losses grew from prior days, when the indexes had fallen only 0.1% to 0.6%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, which gave the composite a fourth [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/). With that, the indexes saw distribution each day of the holiday-shortened week. It's a fast buildup of institutional selling that requires investors to be guarded.

After two weeks of gains, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 1.6% and 1.7% for the past week. In all, the losses did not knock indexes out of their longer-term uptrend. But that uptrend has seen its share of pullbacks, and another downward phase appears to be unfolding.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a second week in a row and lost 0.8% Friday. **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) was the biggest drag on the Dow Friday after sliding 2.6% in a [clear break of its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) slid 3.3% after a [federal ruling found App Store policies are anti-competitive](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-falls-after-epic-games-wins-court-case/).


Dow Falls Below 50-Day Line
---------------------------


The Dow's 2.2% weekly loss was larger than the other two indexes', and the Dow is the weaker index in another sense: It's now trading below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). The Nasdaq and S&P 500 remain above their 50-day lines.


While the Dow is mainly made up of mature companies with modest growth, it is a selective list that acts as a proxy for quality. That makes it a significant index to track.


The IBD 50 reversed lower and ended down 1.3%. It would have performed better had it not been for several glaring drops.


**Maravai LifeSciences** ([MRVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVI)) plunged nearly 12% and [closed below its 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), adding to an awful week for the biotech. The company started selling off Wednesday, when it announced an offering of 20 million shares. On Friday, Maravai priced the offering at $50 a share, or 6% below Thursday's 53.35 closing price.



**SentinelOne** ([S](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=S)) extended a sell-off with a 3.5% drop. **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) and **Dynavax Technologies** ([DVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVAX)) lost about 5% and 7%, respectively. Both had risen sharply from August [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) and now face the inevitable drawdown. **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) gave back 6.6%.


Some Leaders Buck Stock Market Selling
--------------------------------------


**Celsius Holdings** ([CELH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELH)) and **TaskUs** ([TASK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASK)) helped offset some of the IBD 50's weakness. Celsius jumped 4.4% to a new high and is now extended from an 80.10 buy point. TaskUs bounced 3.5% on Friday from a pullback to the 10-day moving average.


**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) rose 3% and continues to build on support at its 10-week moving average.


Outside the IBD 50, **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) broke out past the 128.60 buy point of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/), although volume was only 10% above average. **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) tried to break out of a cup-with-handle but faded.


A week after [the jobs report disappointed](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-hiring-miss-could-delay-fed-tapering-futures-volatile/), inflation alarms went off after the producer price index rose 0.7% in July and 8.3% from July 2020.


"Although the increase itself was smaller than June and July's pair of 1.0% gains, it is still significant. Before 2021, the average headline increase was 0.1%. The average so far for 2021 â€” 0.85%," said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets Economic Research. Excluding food and energy, prices were up 0.6%.

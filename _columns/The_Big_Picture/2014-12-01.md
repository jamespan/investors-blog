There was no holiday cheer for the stock market Monday, as sellers whacked the major indexes and leading stocks.


The Nasdaq snapped a six-session win streak, tumbling 1.3%. That marked its biggest loss since the Oct. 21 follow-through signal. Biotechs, chips and Internet stocks were hit hard. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which makes up about 8% of the Nasdaq, dropped 3%.


The S&P 500 fell 0.7%. Despite a rebound in crude prices, many energy stocks were again under pressure.


The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.6%. Thanks to gains in **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)), **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), the Dow Jones industrial average lost a milder 0.3%.


Lackluster manufacturing data out of China and the eurozone weighed on the stock market, as did news of weak holiday sales. Weekend sales from Thursday to Sunday tumbled 11% from a year ago, according to the National Retail Federation. (See story on Page A1.) Stocks did get some respite from the November ISM figure, which slipped from October but still came in better than expected.


Volume, as expected, increased on both major exchanges from Friday's half-session totals. Volume also was higher on the Nasdaq and the NYSE against Wednesday's figures.


Monday's action marked a distribution day on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Distribution days signal heavy institutional selling.


Even with the day's poor action, the level of distribution is not yet at alarming levels. But the Nasdaq's distribution count doesn't reflect stall days on Nov. 21 and Nov. 25. These could come into play later under certain circumstances â€” basically more distribution days in a short period.


During the recent market uptrend, leaders showed good action, with a small number getting smacked every once in a while. But that was different Monday. The IBD 50 slumped 1.7%, with 46 of its issues lower.


**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) and **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) were the IBD 50's biggest decliners. They lost 5% to 8% in heavy trading. But trade was below average in many other of the components.


**Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) and **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) tripped sell signals. The former erased a 45% gain past a 41.60 buy point. The latter wiped out a 14% advance from an 85.76 entry from a cup with handle and fell as much as 9% from the buy point. But BitAuto found support at its 50-day moving average.

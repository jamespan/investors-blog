An early rebound attempt quickly deflated into another day of losses for [stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). The weakening action, not just among key indexes but also vital sectors this year, prompts a more cautious stance.




The Nasdaq composite gapped higher at the open, but the party ended just 10 minutes into Friday's session. Initially up 0.5% after the open, the tech-centered index fell the rest of the way and closed down 0.8%. It finished at session lows. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and was virtually flat on the NYSE.


Other indexes echoed the bearish move.


The S&P 500 turned a measly 0.3% initial advance into a 0.8% slump. Small caps and certain sector indexes did even worse. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) slid 1.2%; the Dow Jones transportation average tanked 1.9%. These two indexes have now fallen as much as 8.5% and 10.5% from their 52-week highs, respectively.


Stocks Today: Top IPOs Highlight Weakness

Throughout the past week, Big Picture columns have given a bearish tone. Recent breakouts by [CAN SLIM-quality stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/)? Disappointing on the whole, as gains rolled over into losses. Highflying IPOs? The air looks completely out of the balloon in some highfliers such as **Roblox** ([RBLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBLX)) and autonomous truck driving tech firm **TuSimple** ([TSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSP)).


Even oil and gas stocks are triggering key sell signals — think a [big cut below the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) or a [plunge through the 10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) on a weekly chart. Highflying oil stocks got hammered, including **Laredo Petroleum** ([LPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LPI)) (it fell 25% for the week), **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) (off 24%) and related ship transport firm **Danaos** ([DAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAC)) (-14%). All three stocks departed a special watchlist for [IBD Live show subscribers](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live).


The highly contagious delta variant of Covid-19 still wreaks havoc globally. So, brick-and-mortar retailers got pinched hard too. Just look mall-related stocks **Children's Place** ([PLCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLCE)) and **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)). Both stocks floundered, undercutting recent lows.



Market Internals Deteriorate
----------------------------


While the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have not actually dropped much from their all-time highs, a survey of growth stocks today gives you the sense that most leading stocks are tired. That's totally sensible, given that the S&P 500 has more than doubled from its 2020 bear-market low of 2191. Meanwhile, IBD research finds that a slim majority — almost 54% — of stocks in the IBD database are now trading at least 10% below their 52-week highs.


With the market weaker, IBD downgraded its outlook to "uptrend under pressure" from "confirmed uptrend."


Although appropriate, this change and does not necessarily mean it's time to go 100% cash. Rather, [keep your losses small](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-growth-stock-golden-sell-rule-when-take-losses-fast/). Be extra judicious about new buys. And don't forget to tidy up your watchlist. In 2021 so far, the outlook has gone back to a confirmed uptrend from "pressure" no fewer than five times since March. Meanwhile, many names on the [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) actually look quite sturdy.


Finally, consider these three easy ways to tame the market's volatility. One, establish smaller-size positions in new buys. Two, be extra cautious on buying small caps and new IPOs. And three, use much tighter stops to cut losses (at 3% to 5% below your purchase price, rather than 7% to 8%) and take profits (perhaps 10% to 15% instead of 20% to 25%).

Stocks Ease; Square Breaks A Channel; Can These 5 Risks Derail The Bull Run?
=============================================================================

Stocks followed a mostly bullish script on Wednesday, even though trading was light and the major indexes seemed to move with the force of a feather.




 The major indexes staged small moves, with the Nasdaq composite up a hair, the S&P 500 down a fraction, and the lagging Dow Jones industrials giving up less than 0.3%. Volume shrank dramatically vs. Tuesday's levels on the Nasdaq, as expected for a session right before Thanksgiving. Early data also showed lower NYSE volume.


The U.S. financial markets are closed on Thursday, and stocks will wrap up trading early on Friday, with both main exchanges closing at 1 p.m. ET.


With the Nasdaq composite losing the Oct. 18 stalling session on time, the [distribution-day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) count goes to six.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MP112217-207x300.png)For the S&P 500, distribution is still light with just two instances of pronounced institutional selling.


For those new to IBD, all it takes is just [four or five days of significant distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) to transform a bull market into a bearish one. Why? Distribution is the clearest and purest form of information that says the smartest institutional investors in the house are seeing something dark over the horizon and are eagerly taking profits off the table.


Since Wall Street is, in one form, a herd of fund managers, they react with the same emotions of fear, greed and hope as individuals do. But one thing they cannot do is to cover their tracks. That's why IBD pays so much attention to the daily change in both price and volume.


Although the distribution count is still numerically high, the intensity of selling has remained muted. Among the six remaining distribution days that count over the trailing 25 trading sessions, the biggest sell-off was a pair of 0.6% declines on Oct. 23 and Nov. 6. That's hardly a Mike Tyson-like punch (at least during his prime years).


The average drop for those six distributions? A mild 0.4%. No wonder the Nasdaq has not fallen much off its all-time peaks. Since the November 2016 elections, the most that the composite index has dropped is a 4.4% slide in late July to mid-August.


The fourth quarter of this year has been blistering for the Nasdaq, up 5.7% so far with more than five trading weeks left. In contrast, the fourth quarter of 2016 was volatile and choppy; Donald Trump's presidential victory helped hoist the Nasdaq to a 1.3% gain in that three-month period.


The Current Risks
-----------------


Today, market participants seem cheered by a big step by Congress last week to pass a wide-sweeping tax reform bill in the House of Representative. It's now being tinkered in the Senate, but many officials are hopeful that a comprehensive package can be signed, sealed and delivered at the White House before Christmas.


Failure to get this legislation done would certainly be a big enough blow to push the rally off its tracks. Would it be enough to end the eight-year-long bull run? Likely not. The U.S. economy is strengthening. The early read on third-quarter U.S. GDP growth of 3% is a nice step up from paltry annualized gains of 1.2% and 2.6% in the first two quarters of the year.


What are some other risks to the current market uptrend? Here are at least four more to monitor:


* The Federal Reserve gets overly hawkish. Wage inflation and some commodity prices are rising enough to meet the U.S. central bank's target for 2% annual inflation before continuing to raise short-term interest rates. Some observers say the Fed cannot raise rates quickly because of the country's huge debt load. However, the Fed has signaled multiple rate hikes through 2018. In the most recent meeting, the Fed [favored more rate hikes](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-signals-december-hike-even-as-debate-on-inflation-persists/) even if inflation remains tame. A flattening or inversion of the yield curve could dent the economy and affect investors' expectations for corporate growth.
* Wall Street earnings estimates get overzealous. That fortunately did not happen in the third quarter. But if analysts' price targets and profit forecasts get too optimistic, it sets up the possibility of major disappointments in future quarterly results.
* An exogenous shock. 9/11 is the latest example. However, the market had already shown evidence of heavy institutional selling before terrorists destroyed New York's World Trade Center.
* A Chinese economic freeze. Again, highly unlikely right now. Consumer spending and industrial output are humming. But when Chinese authorities sought to clamp down on excessive speculation and lending in 2015, it helped spark a massive bear market for mainland Chinese equities in the summer that year.
* U.S. market leaders showing key topping action en masse. We're not there yet at all. As seen in the IBD 50 and Big Cap 20, the top growth plays are mostly showing healthy action. Yet **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), one of the best performing new IPOs lately, has gotten a little hot. While the current action is not quite a classic climax run, the point of sale and financial technology firm has rallied 35% in just 10 sessions. That's on top of big gains since the Silicon Valley stock gapped out of a base at 15.59 on Feb. 23. Since then, shares have climbed 217%.



As seen in a weekly chart, Square has violated an upper channel that starts with the 18.17 high made in early March. However, keep in mind that Square is still a relatively young market leader. And a break of an upper channel is no guarantee of a major top.


Investors not only have positive market technicals to be thankful for. At least one expert in growth and income investing has been impressed with the turnaround in cash payouts among large U.S. companies.


Alex Crooke, London-based head of global equity income strategies at Janus Henderson and manager of the 129-year-old Bankers Investment Trust fund, publishes a global quarterly report on the value of cash dividends. He notes that the U.S. has become "a poster child for a return to health in global dividends. During the 2016 election year, U.S. companies had deliberately put the brakes on increasing payouts. But in the past two quarters, U.S. firms have rebounded with year-over-year dividend growth of 10%.


"The growth has been stunning," Crooke told IBD. He notes that big and megacap technology companies have been notable new providers of dividends vs. 10 years ago.

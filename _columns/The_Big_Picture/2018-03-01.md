  Trump Tariff Sell-Off Triggers New Stock Market Outlook

U.S. stock indexes turned further south Thursday on news that President Trump will impose tariffs on aluminum and steel imports.




 The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each lopped off 1.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 did best, losing 0.3%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


The Nasdaq just barely closed above its 50-day moving average, a line the other indexes have already lost. This is not the way bulls had hoped the current uptrend would develop.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MP_4x4_030118-242x300.png)The market uptrend is now under pressure, which means investors must be more cautious. Taking some profits makes sense, and new stock purchases should be limited.


In some ways, the rough progress after the follow-through day was to be expected. The market moved into correction in early February with sharp vertical spikes. Bulls would rather see a more controlled descent. When indexes knife below the 50-day line so sharply, [follow-throughs](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) have a tendency to not work so well.


Earlier in the session, the Nasdaq fell modestly on nervousness surrounding Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell's looming testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.


Powell's testimony Tuesday to a House panel rattled the stock market, and the Fed chief appeared to walk back some of his remarks Thursday.


"Nothing ... suggests to me that wage inflation is at a point of acceleration," Powell said.


Stock indexes erased their early losses on Powell's comments. The stock market then wavered but looked like it had a shot at a modestly positive finish.

Then along came the tariffs announcement.


Trump's move on tariffs brought trouble to the stock market from a fresh angle. The president said the U.S. would slap a 10% tariff on aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on steel imports as early as next week.


Tariffs seldom play out in isolation.


Other countries could respond by sticking tariffs on U.S. exports such as agricultural products.


The tariff on steel imports is expected to most hurt China, Canada, South Korea, Brazil and Russia.


Steel Stocks Rise
-----------------


Steel stocks rose Thursday. **United States Steel** ([X](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=X)) jumped almost 6% in volume 240% above average. **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) posted a 4% thrust in volume 62% above normal. **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) popped 3% in volume 65% faster than usual.


The broader picture held less hope. The gains in steel stocks were not widely shared. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, losers led winners by a 9-2 ratio.


If the stock indexes were showing a distaste for protectionism, they had economists on their side. Polls have shown that 93% of economists believe tariffs have an overall negative effect on the economy. And economists aren't known for reaching a consensus among themselves.


The bottom line for the stock market is that trade wars create uncertainty, as countries slap and punch at each other. And the market hates uncertainty.


Reagan And Tariffs
------------------


One thing to consider is that other U.S. presidents have taken protectionist measures without killing the stock market — at least not immediately.


President Reagan, for example, announced a 100% tariff on certain Japan electronics in late March 1987. The stock market then moved sideways for about six months before the crash took it down in October 1987. No one, though, has blamed the 1987 crash on tariffs.


Among other stocks, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) remained positive much of the morning but closed down 1.8%.


Two companies that could be hurt by either higher steel prices or retaliatory measures from other nations dived Thursday. **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) slashed 3.5% lower in volume 64% above average. **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) tripped almost 3% in volume 56% faster than usual.


Technicals Worsen
-----------------


Meanwhile, the technical picture for the stock market crumbled. Thursday marked the third [distribution day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in a row for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.


Distribution involves a price loss in rising volume and points to institutional selling.


The put-call volume ratio provided the day's lone bright spot. The ratio closed at 1.17. Readings of 1.15 or higher often coincide with short-term market bottoms.

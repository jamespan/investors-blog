The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 closed near session highs in the stock market Tuesday as blue chips and small caps came under mild selling pressure. **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) and **Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)) joined the breakout ranks, but homebuilders sold off sharply, fueling widespread weakness in the building sector.




The Russell 2000 small-cap index reversed lower after briefly topping the 2000 level. An opening gain of 0.9% faded to a loss of nearly 0.4% by the close.


The 10-year Treasury yield, which got turned away at its 50-day line Friday, was up 4 basis points to 4.14% just after the stock market close. The 50-day moving average for the yield, currently around 4.16%, is still a potential resistance level to watch.


Stock Market Today
------------------


After topping the 38,000 level Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back nearly 0.3% as a weak earnings report and outlook from **3M** ([MMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MMM)) was offset by strong results at **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)).

Verizon gapped above an alternate entry of 40.37 and is still inside the 5% buy zone after [wireless subscriber adds](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/verizon-earnings-vz-stock-wireless-subscriber-adds/) topped expectations. Not only is Verizon showing improved relative strength, but the company also boasts a lofty annualized dividend yield of 6.3%.


PG stock is also in a buy zone based on a 153.63 entry. It's near the top of a long consolidation that started in August.


The S&P 500 marked its fourth straight gain and rose 0.3% to another record closing high despite broad selling in the homebuilder group. **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) missed earnings expectations. Shares plunged 9% but held above the 50-day line.


Weakness in DHI stock spread into other homebuilders in the S&P 500, including **PulteGroup** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)), **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)). All three stocks ended with losses ranging from 5% to 6.5% in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/).


Several other S&P components in the building sector came under pressure. In the heavy construction group, **Quanta Services** ([PWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PWR)) plunged down to its 200-day line but held above it, falling nearly 4%, while group peer **Sterling Infrastructure** ([STRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STRL)) breached its 50-day line in heavy volume.


Stocks On The Move
------------------


Separately, **Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) shed 6% but held support at its 21-day exponential moving average.


Declining stocks on the NYSE had a slight edge over advancers.


Volume on the NYSE fell slightly from Monday after the S&P 500 suffered a [stalling session](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stalling-signals-an-early-warning-for-stock-market-heres-how-to-find-this-insidious-signal/) Monday. On the surface, six distribution days for the index since Dec. 20 might seem like a lot. But only two of those days — a 1.5% drop on Dec. 20 and a 0.8% drop Jan. 3 — really had the feel of institutional selling.

The Nasdaq composite stretched its winning streak to four sessions, rising 0.4% in lower volume. Breadth was slightly negative on the Nasdaq as well.


After gapping up Monday, Snowflake added an additional 3% and topped a 202.83 entry. It's still in the 5% buy zone.


Also in the enterprise software group, **Monday.com** ([MNDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNDY)) cleared a 199.68 buy point Monday but closed well off highs. To the stock's credit, it followed through Tuesday and closed near session highs, rising more than 6%.


Truck maker **Paccar** ([PCAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCAR)) rallied for the sixth straight session and topped a 98.47 entry in heavy trading. It's still in a buy zone, but after several up days in a row, PCAR could be ready to take a breather.



Even though the big stock market leaders started breaking out of bases in late October and early November, recent base breakouts are still working OK. Just remember that if you're watching a stock poised to break out of a base, make sure it's one of the leaders in its industry group — not a second- or third-tier stock.


In many cases, buying a big leader on a pullback makes more sense than buying a second-rate stock trying to break out of a base.


A couple of other stocks near buy points in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com) outperformed.


**East West Bancorp** ([EWBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWBC)) rose 1% and is near the top of a flat base with a 74.61 buy point.


Among online travel firms, **Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) is showing good technical action. After a low-volume pullback, EXPE is holding support at its 10-week line and is almost five weeks into a new base.

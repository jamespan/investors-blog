Stocks Cut Much Of Day's Loss, But Battle At 50-Day Persists
=============================================================

Stocks struggled Thursday as the major indexes tested their 50-day moving average lines.


The Nasdaq cut an early 1% loss to 0.3%. The S&P 500 and the IBD 50 each ended off 0.2%.


Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq.


Both major indexes opened lower and then staged positive reversals.


The Nasdaq bounced off its 50-day line in a successful test, but the S&P 500 closed under its 50-day for a second straight day.


While the overall action could've been worse, the uptrend looks increasingly iffy. Thursday's action slapped the S&P 500 with a distribution day. The distribution count is now at 7 for both indexes, which doesn't leave the uptrend much elbow room.


Uncertain action from the indexes is nothing new. Take a look at the Nasdaq's chart on B2, although the daily chart at Investors.com is clearer.


In July, the Nasdaq twice touched the 4485 level and found resistance both times. The resistance was broken in August on the third try.


In September, the index twice touched the 4610 level and found resistance both times. The resistance was broken at the end of October on the third try.


In November-December, the Nasdaq twice touched the 4810 level and found resistance both times. The resistance was broken in February on the third try.


Each case involved a pullback of roughly 4% to 11% after the second try before the third effort undid resistance.


Where is the market now?


The Nasdaq has twice found resistance after crossing above 5,000. If the market follows the same script that it did in 2014, then a pullback is likely now. It would set the indexes up for a third charge.


At some point, it's reasonable to expect the market to break sharply up or down. Until then, individual investors must play the game with a light touch.


Leaders took some hard shots Thursday.


**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) fell 8% below recent entries, triggering a sell rule. Still, they rebounded to finish up for the day.


Many stocks selling off hard might be reflecting profit-taking. For example, **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) all were carrying a "could take profits" label in the IBD charts.


On Friday, the final estimate on fourth quarter GDP will be released before the market opens. The Street's consensus figure is 2.4%, with the range running from 2.1% to 2.6%.

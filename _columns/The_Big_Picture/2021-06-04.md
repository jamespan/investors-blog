The stock market liked the look of a weaker-than-expected jobs report and falling interest rates Friday. The Nasdaq 100 fared the best, up 1.8%, but the Nasdaq composite wasn't far behind, up 1.5%. There wasn't much conviction behind the buying, though, as volume fell sharply from Thursday's levels.




After closing just below its 50-day moving average Thursday, the Nasdaq composite gapped up and came close to taking out Monday's high of 13,836. The S&P 500 rallied 0.9%. While it closed less than three points from an all-time closing high, the SPDR 500 ETF ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) marked an all-time closing high, resulting in an improved change in IBD's [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/).


The stock market uptrend resumed Friday. The outlook had been changed to uptrend under pressure on May 12, when the Nasdaq fell 2.7%. The Nasdaq rallied from there. After gapping down Thursday and closing just below its 50-day line, the index bounced back above it. The Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) also showed bullish action Friday, closing above its May 28 and June 1 closing highs.

Stock Market Today
------------------


![MP060421](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MP060421-260x300.jpg)The Dow Jones industrials rallied 0.5%, helped by strength in technology components like **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Microsoft climbed above its 50-day line, but it needs to get above its May 26 high of 252.94 to fully break out of its downtrend.


While the stock market is now more positive and risk has decreased, investors should raise exposure carefully.


The Nasdaq's outperformance was helped by a big drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, which fell 7 basis points to 1.56%.


The [economy created 559,000 jobs in May](https://www.investors.com/news/jobs-report-hiring-recovery-still-sluggish-in-may-dow-jones/), a bit below the Econoday consensus of 650,000. The unemployment rate fell to 5.8% from 6.1%, and April job growth was revised slightly higher to 278,000 from 266,000. The lukewarm report didn't do much to fan fears that the Federal Reserve might be close to tapering its monthly asset purchases or raising interest rates earlier than expected. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for June 15-16.


Stock Market Movers
-------------------


The Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) had a solid day, up 1.3%, helped by strength in **360 DigiTech** ([QFIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QFIN)). The Chinese stock cleared a cup base with a 35.25 buy point. It ended the week still in the 5% buy zone, but after 12 gains in 15 sessions, it's a riskier buy at current levels. IBD 50 component **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) soared to a new high early, but reversed slightly lower.

Earnings season sometimes leaves its mark on the stock market, and Thursday was a perfect example, especially for the Nasdaq composite.




The Nasdaq sold off nearly 2.1%, its worst day since March 9.


It's been no secret that the Nasdaq's fortunes this year rest largely on seven megacaps. So when one of those stocks breaks down, the whole index feels it. On Thursday, it was **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) that took the blame and, to a lesser extent, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Investors were rattled about both companies' outlooks.


To be sure, stock market selling spread far beyond Big Tech. Nasdaq decliners topped advancers by a nearly 2-to-1 ratio. A note on breadth: While the Nasdaq 100 slid 2.3%, First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ETF ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)) lost only half that much.


The S&P 500's loss was moderate for much of the day but grew into the afternoon, ending with a 0.7% drop. The Russell 2000 lost 0.9%. The IBD 50 index was routed 3.2%, the worst beating since March 10.


But it was a different story for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It rose 0.5% after three of its components jumped on earnings.


**Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) rallied 6.1% in big volume. J&J beat Q2 estimates and [raised its profit guidance](https://www.barrons.com/articles/johnson-and-johnson-jnj-stock-price-earnings-talc-a1d2f5aa?mod=md_stockoverview_news). **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) rose 1.8% and **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) rallied 2.1% after its Q2 earnings report late Wednesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MP_4x2_072023-213x300.jpg)That helped the Dow rise for a ninth consecutive session. That's the longest winning streak since Sept. 20, 2017, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Volume fell on the NYSE and rose slightly on the Nasdaq, resulting in a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) for the composite.


Dow Leading Stock Market Indexes
--------------------------------


The Dow outperformed the Nasdaq by 2.52 percentage points Thursday — the widest performance gap since March 18, 2021.


It wasn't just a one-off event.


The Dow is still lagging the Nasdaq (which is up 34.4% year to date), S&P 500 (18.1%) and Russell 2000 (11.7%). The Dow is up 6.3% so far this year.


But since the Dow found support after a pull back to the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/) on July 10, it has outperformed the other main stock market indexes with a 4.4% gain. The Nasdaq is up 3% and the S&P 3.1% in the same time.


A rebound in the 10-year Treasury yield Thursday also didn't do tech stocks any favors. The benchmark yield rose 11 basis points to 3.85%, the largest gain since June 29.


The latest [jobless claims fell to 228,000](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=556151&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top) from a revised 237,000 the previous week. The data was below forecasts for 241,000.


In other economic data, the  Index of Leading Economic Indicators fell 0.7% in June, and has dropped for 15 consecutive months. Existing home sales fell to an annual rate 4.16 million in June from 4.3 million the previous month. The number was [down 18.9% year over year](https://ibd.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.aspx?fid=562155&cust=ibd&year=2023&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top), according to Econoday.

Tesla, Chip Stocks Impact Market
--------------------------------



Tesla's rout was the main reason the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)) tumbled 3.4%, wiping out more than six days of gains. The ETF ended a remarkable run in which it rose nine straight days and 14 of the past 15 sessions. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)), **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) and **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) helped the fund's torrid July run.


Chip stocks were broadly lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index off 3.6%. **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) beat Q2 expectations but [cut its sales outlook for the full year](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tsm-stock-taiwan-semiconductor-cuts-2023-sales-outlook/). TSMC is now forecasting a 10% decline, up from its earlier view for a mid-single-digit decline. Shares fell more than 5%.


**ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) tumbled more than 5% in heavy volume. The stock gapped below the 50-day line in heavy volume and dropped more than 7% below last week's breakout at 747.13. That [triggered a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

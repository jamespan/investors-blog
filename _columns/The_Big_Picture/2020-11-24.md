The bull market adores certainty.




As highlighted in IBD's coverage of the [stock market Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-breaks-key-barrier-trump-agrees-power-transfer-tesla-stock-fedex-stock-top-performers/),Â [President Donald Trump signaled](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-breaks-key-barrier-trump-agrees-power-transfer-tesla-stock-fedex-stock-top-performers/) he was a step closer to conceding defeat to President-elect Joe Biden.


Meanwhile, Biden's pick of Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve chair, squashed any concern that the powerful central bank would radically turn away from its policy of almost-free money.


Combine that with [more progress on the Covid-19 vaccine front](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/azn-stock-dips-coronavirus-vaccine-70-effective-average/) and fresh economic data pointing to an ongoing recovery, and the veteran IBD reader likely would not at all be surprised by how well stocks acted on Tuesday.


"We see Janet Yellen as a strong choice and reinforces our view the loss of 10 House seats in the election gave the former Vice President cover to pull back to the center vs. moving hard left," Tony Dwyer, a veteran market watcher and equity strategist at Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a note Tuesday. "Janet Yellen has exceptional experience, knows how to print money, and should be instrumental in being able to negotiate a near-term fiscal package."


Dow Jones Participates In The Bull Market
-----------------------------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1.5% gain to 30,046 didn't simply make history as the first close above a key psychological price level. The action affirms that the Dow's [follow-through day on Nov. 4](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/) was no head-fake of a rally.


Since that noteworthy session, the Dow industrials have climbed nearly 7.9%.


Meanwhile, gold continued to dive while Bitcoin kept its surge going.


SPDR Gold Shares ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) dropped 1.5%, almost testing its 200-day moving average.


Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)) gained 1%, although it gave back most of the day's gains. The ETF has moved as much as 62% past a 14.88 buy point in its nine-week [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/).

MP112420Don't Ignore The Mighty Mites
-------------------------------------


Small caps excelled yet again. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)), up 1.9% on Tuesday, has extended its fourth-quarter gain to nearly 23%.


The S&P 500 rose 1.6% Tuesday. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, cleared several days of tight, sideways action to finish up 1.3% and end above 12,000 for only the second time in history.


Heavier volume on both main exchanges gave an unmistakable sign that equity trading desks across the land energetically put more capital to work.


The Nasdaq stretched its streak of above-average turnover for a seventh straight session.


Are More Value Stocks Breaking Out?
-----------------------------------


Turnaround stocks making new and recent breakouts from [first-stage bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) are increasing. Check out **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)), **Cheniere Energy** ([LNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNG)), **Cactus** ([WHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WHD)) and **Zions Bancorp** ([ZION](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZION)).


[MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) has flagged these and other new breakouts through its [pattern recognition technology](https://marketsmith.investors.com/patternrecognition/).



Meanwhile, genuine growth stocks such as **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) are refusing to retreat after strong breakouts past a correct buy point. Palo Alto has risen 14% in seven days after clearing its 260.25 pivot point in a [well-formed double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/).


[On Monday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A#team), panelists noted how the PMI Composite flash index for November, at 57.9, beat every economist's forecast surveyed by [Econoday](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/). A figure above 50 points to expanding activity in this survey of private-sector manufacturing and service firms. On Tuesday, Case-Shiller data highlighted strong price growth for housing across 20 major metropolitan areas in September.


The yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged up 2 basis points to 0.88%. Yet the yield has come off sharply from this month's peak of 0.98%. Meanwhile, the yield curve has maintained a healthy ascent from short-term notes to long-term bonds. While three-month T-bills give a paltry 0.09% in yield, the 30-year bond offers a 1.6% return.


Yardeni Research has found that the average yield since the "QE4ever" monetary policy shift on March 23 is 0.70%. Treasury notes and bonds held by the public fell by $613 billion. Federal Reserve holdings rose by $1.63 trillion.


Bull Market Internals Improve
-----------------------------


More than 800 stocks and ETFs hit new 52-week or all-time highs, while fewer than 100 struck new lows, early data showed.


Meanwhile, advancers beat decliners by more than a 3-1 margin on the NYSE and by 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.


On Monday, IBD counted [380 issues making new highs and just 10 hitting 52-week lows](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-nov-23-2020/). You can track the daily totals and see which sectors boasted the largest number of stocks at new highs at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).


Yet lately, stocks from the automobile, retail, software, chip, medical and finance sectors have led the drive to new highs. The Market Pulse table showcases stocks that have done well since breaking out and are surpassing a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Of course, uncertainty over Covid-19 and the pace of economic recovery could smack stocks. One out of every 1,250 Americans have succumbed to the coronavirus, data from Johns Hopkins University shows.


In a recent note to clients, wealth manager Glenmede said that the U.S. economy has returned to roughly 70% of its pre-Covid-19 level of activity.

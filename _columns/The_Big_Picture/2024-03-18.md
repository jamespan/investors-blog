  Stock Market Rallies Evenly Among Large Caps But Small Caps Dip; Could This Sector Break Out Amid Fed News?

The [stock market](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/) seemingly has adjusted to a few major changes in investors' thinking in recent weeks. One change: The pace of inflation isn't falling as quickly as many thought. Two, the Federal Reserve, which holds a new meeting on interest rates over the next two days, has been right to tread cautiously on opening back up the money spigot.




Nonetheless, despite Monday's general rebound, the unevenness of the day's rise perhaps persuaded individual investors to stay very picky about taking on new positions.


The "general rebound" refers to large-cap issues regaining their footing on Monday. But small caps suffered more losses after yielding significant ground in the prior week.


Stock Market Today
------------------


While the Nasdaq composite advanced 0.8%, edging a 0.6% lift by the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 sank 0.7%. That came on top of a 2.1% slide by the small-cap index last week.


Meanwhile, the yield on the prevailing U.S. Treasury 10-year bond ticked up 3 basis points to 4.34%, the highest close since Nov. 30. In general, stock market sectors that show particular sensitivity to higher lending rates fell on Monday.


SPDR Sector Select Utilities ([XLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLU)) declined nearly 0.4%. The exchange traded fund, down fractionally for the year, is making a key test of support at its gently falling 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones transportation average lost 0.5% and fell for the fourth straight session.



Notice on a daily chart how the Dow transports took out the 50-day moving average. That's not what you want to see in a healthy, broad-based bull market.

This Is Not 2023 All Over Again, For Now
----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MP031824-1-199x300.jpg)Midcaps fell much more softly than the small caps. The SPDR S&P Mid Cap 400 ([MDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDY)) ETF eased 0.2%.


A close examination of the stock market indexes reveals the year-to-date performance between the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 has really evened out thus far in 2024.


At 5,149, the S&P 500 holds a year-to-date gain of almost 8%. Annualized, that's solid. Plus, that actually surpasses a 7.3% rise for the Nasdaq.


One also cannot ignore the fact that the S&P 500 on Monday easily wiped out its prior two weeks of mild losses.


That's more than a crumb of comfort for IBD readers justifiably fretting about the unusually high count of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) over the past 25 trading sessions for both the S&P's large-cap gauge and for the Nasdaq. Please see the Market Pulse each day to keep track of the current count.


As this column has noted, a sudden rush of big sell-offs in heavy volume can derail a stock market uptrend and force IBD readers to head to cash. But as of right now, the average loss for those six distributions on the S&P is still relatively palatable at less than 0.7%.


Professional selling has been a little more intense on the Nasdaq. The recent six sell-offs in higher turnover have averaged just under 0.9%.


Here Comes The Fed Decision
---------------------------


Volume slid sharply, early data showed. On the Nasdaq, turnover fell more than 39% vs. Friday's session, which got a boost from expiring monthly and weekly options. The New York Stock Exchange saw 47% fewer shares exchange hands compared with the prior session.


Did you spot another clue that institutional investors — think mutual funds, pensions, insurers, large investment advisors and the like — preferred to sit on their hands ahead of the two-day Federal Reserve meeting? You might have spotted it on IBD's various stock lists.


On the IBD 50, [as seen in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) and on the [Stock Lists section of Investors.com](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), only 13 companies saw trading go above their average levels over the past 50 days. That's roughly a quarter of the stock list.


Breakout Potential?
-------------------


In other markets, crude oil jumped sharply.


West Texas Intermediate oil futures rose 2% to $82.21 a barrel. That marked the highest daily close since Oct. 30.


Could a continued rally in black gold spur a real rotation into the companies that explore, refine or market the critical energy source? It may be a little too early to tell. However, a few names, including oil services firm **Weatherford International** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)), have gotten a little more airplay on [IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A).


**TechnipFCN** ([FTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTI)), a NYSE-listed firm in IBD's oil and gas machinery industry group, has proved to be one of the better-glowing breakout stocks lately.


The midcap growth stock broke out of a four-month [cup without a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) showing a 22.78 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on March 1. An immediate pullback to the 10-day moving average failed to thwart the rally. At 24.58, Technip has now risen nearly 8% past the pivotal entry price.


The stock joined [SwingTrader on March 7](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).

Small Caps Vs. The Stock Market
-------------------------------


Ironically, two of the stocks making the upside section of [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) hail from small-cap land. **Turtle Beach** ([HEAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEAR)) and **Vital Farms** ([VITL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VITL)) both rallied sharply in heavy turnover. So did **QuickLogic** ([QUIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QUIK)), an emerging new leader and microcap stock within the highly ranked fabless semiconductor industry group. That group ranks No. 4 out of 197 industries for six-month price performance.


Of course, this is just a subtle note about the small caps. What's truly notable about the stock market now? A dearth of really powerful breakouts by stocks that hold true leadership credentials.


[MarketSurge](https://marketsurge.investors.com/?src=A012BF) gives an easy-to-use barometer on that end. Right on the homepage, after Monday's close, you'll see that it lists zero stocks making the criteria for a built-in screen called "Breaking Out Today."


In fact, the past two weeks have shown few, if any, sessions in which at least three stocks or more made the "Breaking Out Today" screen. Quite a contrast from, say, the Week of Feb. 5. During that week, three stocks qualified on Feb. 5 and Feb. 7. On Feb. 8 and 9, a total of 17 companies made the cut.


Such statistics make sense, however, when considering that the stock market has been in rally mode since a strong follow-through day on Nov. 1 kicked the bulls into higher gear.

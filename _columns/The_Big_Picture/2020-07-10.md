Stock market bulls headed into the weekend feeling pretty good about things after a 1% early loss for the Nasdaq composite morphed into a 0.7% gain by the close.




The index is still trading near the top of an upper channel, which has flagged a few pullbacks since the April 6 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), but each pullback stopped at the index's 21-day moving average. The Nasdaq on Friday closed 5% above its 21-day line.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 small-cap index outperformed with gains of 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) led the Dow, although big gains did little to improve their technical health. In the coming week, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan headline a busy week of [financial earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/dominos-stock-will-strong-earnings-fuel-a-bullish-breakout/).


Beaten-down financials rallied sharply Friday along with airline stocks. Top-performing groups like enterprise software and biotech lagged.


![MP071020](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/MP071020-252x300.jpg)The S&P 500 rallied just over 1%. After finding support at its 10-week moving average, the index is getting into a position for a breakout try over its recent high of 3233.


Nasdaq Surges 4% For Week
-------------------------


For the week, the Nasdaq surged 4%, the S&P rallied nearly 1.8% and the Dow Jones picked up close to 1%. Nasdaq volume fell and preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than Thursday.


The S&P 500's June 4 [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) fell off the count due to the 25-day rule. In other words, enough time has passed to make it irrelevant. The S&P 500 suffered a mild distribution day Thursday, falling 0.6% in higher volume. The index now shows four distribution days, but only one had the feeling of meaningful institutional selling. That was on June 24, when the index slumped 2.6% in higher volume.


Stock Market Today
------------------


Thirty-five stocks in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) ended lower Friday, but Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) eked out a gain of 0.2%. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) stock **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) was a bright spot, up 8%. Shares were strong after after Goldman Sachs maintained a buy rating but raised its price target to 670 from 540. Netflix is among a growing group of growth stocks that are well extended from proper buy areas. Netflix reports earnings on July 16 along with **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), which marked a new high Friday.

If you got a nice gain in a stock market leader like **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), there's nothing wrong with trimming the position. Or, you could wait and see what a test of the [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) looks like for both stocks. Datadog bounced nicely off its 21-day line on June 29. So did Tesla in late June soon after a breakout over a 869.92 buy point.


But several growth stocks are still near buy points with healthy charts, including **BJ's Wholesale Club** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)), **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) and **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)).

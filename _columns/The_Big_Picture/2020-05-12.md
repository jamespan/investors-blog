title: Stock Market Bears Rule Session, But Here's Why The Uptrend Is Still Intact

If you had been thinking that the U.S. stock market was long due for a pullback, you can pat yourself on the back now. Indexes fell broadly, accelerating their declines in the last 45 minutes of Tuesday's trade.




After six straight up sessions that totaled 6.8% upside, the Nasdaq composite gave back less than a third of that advance, falling almost 2.1%. The S&P 500 virtually matched that drop.


Small caps fell even harder. The Russell 2000 slid more than 4%, coming close to exceeding a 4.3% shellacking on April 15. Yet for the second quarter, at 1275 the popular gauge for equities with a market value of around $3 billion or less still shows a hearty 10.5% advance.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) snapped a three-day win streak, losing 2.9%. After losing 16.8% in 2018, the ETF rebounded 25.4% last year.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MP_2x1_051220_-217x300.jpg)Volume rose more than 11% on the Nasdaq vs. the prior session, and grew 6% on the NYSE. So, make no mistake; the noteworthy decline in heavier trading clearly pointed at Tuesday as a session of heavy institutional profit-taking, known as a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/).


When you get a clump of serious distribution days over a narrow time frame — think within a week or two — such unusually intense selling can spell the end of a bull run.


The Last Time Stock Market Bears Were Grinning
----------------------------------------------


That was certainly the case back in February.


On Feb. 11, the Nasdaq rose 0.1% but reversed off session highs, marking a rare stalling session. Then it got hit with real distribution. It fell 0.7% on Feb. 20, 1.8% on Feb. 21, then lopped off 3.7% and 2.8% in the next two sessions, respectively. On that final sell-off, Feb. 25, the Big Picture changed the outlook for stocks to "market in correction" from "uptrend under pressure." All bets were off. (Please read more about this type of negative market action, called a vertical violation, in [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/).)


Are we going back to that dark corner on Wall Street again?


Of course, no one knows. Taking the price-and-volume action one day at a time favors the assiduous individual investor.


However, surveying both the top guns in your portfolio and the army of new market leaders is always an excellent daily exercise. And Tuesday's narrative, at least among the true market leaders, wasn't so bearish. Numerous stocks have been running sharply higher for weeks. So did you see pullbacks in lighter trade? Totally normal.


[On IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), just three names dropped in above-average turnover. They include **Axon Enterprise** ([AAXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAXN)) and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)), the leader in GCM (glucose continuous monitoring) devices for diabetic care.


So, What Caused The Late-Hour Selling?
--------------------------------------


People are often curious about why the market did what it did. Was it the bigger than expected drop in consumer prices for April, excluding volatile food and energy items? (The core CPI fell 0.4% vs. the prior month, a much bigger drop than the [Econoday forecast](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/).) Did testimony from Anthony Fauci, a top federal health official, on Covid-19 boost pessimism over how well the U.S. will reopen while avoiding or minimizing a second wave of coronavirus cases? Maybe the possible decision by Los Angeles County officials to extend stay-at-home orders for a few more months offered the perfect excuse for fund managers to dump shares?


Whatever the reason, pullbacks following such a hot rebound always benefit nascent uptrends.


Mike Webster, IBD's head market strategist and an [IBD Live panelist](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958), notes that 9000 serves as a key test of support for the Nasdaq composite. A further decline would mean the next technical level to test is at or around the April 29 high of 8957. He added that a 50% retracement from the gains since May 4 "would be a logical place to stop." In other words, a pullback to 8893 on the Nasdaq would be perfectly normal.

Currently, the action remains bullish.


On Tap Wednesday: "Bazooka Jay" Speech
--------------------------------------


More economic data, including weekly U.S. oil and gas inventories, plus April producer price levels, will get attention. So too will a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for 9 a.m. ET. ([The latest Inside Big Cap 20 column](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/fed-and-ballooning-us-debt-how-to-pick-growth-stocks-today/) explains why Powell has gotten the moniker "Bazooka Jay.")


Ken Berman, Gorilla Trades strategist, noted that the "implied fed funds rate fell below zero for the first time ever amid the global economic gloom, and although the market normalized since then, negative rates have been firmly opposed by the FOMC and Mr. Powell in the past."


"Should the chairman be more flexible towards sub-zero rates, we could see tectonic moves in bond markets and the dollar, even though there is little evidence on the effectiveness of such policies," Berman added.


On Tuesday, the yield on the key U.S. Treasury 10-year bond slid 4 basis points to 0.69% — still sharply above a 0.13% yield for three-month T-bills and 0.17% for two-year notes.


In a separate note, Joe Kalish at Ned Davis Research said they do not expect the U.S. central bank to implement a negative interest rate policy (NIRP) in the U.S. But he also pointed out a "non-zero probability" of a depression scenario. If price deflation takes hold, the Fed could cut rates into negative territory to avoid rising real interest rates.


On March 15, the Fed slashed the cost of overnight loans to money-center banks (the fed funds rate) to a 0%-0.25% target range. According to Bloomberg data, the yield on German 10-year bunds has dropped to 0.51%; Japanese government 10-year bonds yield -0.02%. In other words, investors pay these countries' central banks to store their cash.


Stock Market Bears Flood Options Exchanges Too
----------------------------------------------


Fear among options traders jumped. The [Cboe Market Volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), or the VIX, pole-vaulted 16.7% to 32.18. That set the biggest single-session jump since the major indexes bottomed out on March 23. Updated every day in the [IBD Psychological Market Indicators section](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), the VIX is now back to the same level as late February.

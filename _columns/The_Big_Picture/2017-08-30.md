The bulls were hoping for some follow through Wednesday for the Nasdaq composite after Tuesday's bullish reversal in higher volume, and that's exactly what they got as the index jumped 1.1% in higher volume.


Overall, it was a constructive session, with several top-rated growth names making solid moves higher.




The S&P 500 closed above its 50-day moving average, rising 0.5%, the Russell 2000 small-cap index added nearly 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% higher.


Volume on the NYSE came in lower than Tuesday. The Nasdaq's July 26 stalling session fell of the distribution-day count due to time. Winners led losers by about 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.

Biogen is close to clearing a long consolidation with a conventional entry at 312.50. Shares of Incyte were strong on news it and Eli Lilly play to reapply for approval of a rheumatoid arthritis drug in early 2018.


Cement, concrete and aggregate producers like **Eagle Materials** ([EXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXP)), **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) and **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) outperformed with gains of 5% to 7% in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.


The stock market has always been known as counterintuitive, doing what's least expected more often than not. Signs of institutional selling first started to show in the Nasdaq in late July and started to cluster after that. The Nasdaq slid below the 50-day moving average two times in higher volume: once on Aug. 10 and again on Aug. 17. The bears were licking their chops at the time, but the Nasdaq is back above the 50-day moving average, only 1% off its high.


With the market in a confirmed uptrend, it's OK to nibble at select, high-quality names, but also realize it still remains a challenging environment for chart breakouts. Breakouts need consistent institutional buying to really work, and that's a tall order, not only in the summertime, but also in the later stages of a bull market.


In [economic news](https://www.investors.com/category/news/economy/), the second estimate to Q2 gross domestic product came in at 3%, above the initial estimate of 2.6%. That good news was followed up by more good news from ADP that showed private payroll growth of 237,000 in August, well above the consensus estimate of 185,000. The market on Friday is expecting nonfarm payrolls to increase by 180,000, a little below July's increase of 209,000.


The 10-year Treasury yield didn't move much on the positive economic data, rising 1 basis point to 2.13%.


Big movers Wednesday included [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) name **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)). Shares surged 12% to 124.45 as they approach a double-bottom entry of 127.88. The strength was fueled by positive comments from Deutsche Bank, which initiated coverage with a buy rating and set a 135 price target.


Other big gainers in the IBD 50 included [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) names **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), up nearly 3% each. Headed into Wednesday, the IBD 50 was up 18.5% year-to-date, nearly doubling the S&P 500's gain of 9.8%. The IBD outperformed again Wednesday, rising 1.5%.


**AeroVironment** ([AVAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVAV)) was another big gainer, but it's on the thin side with an average daily dollar volume of just over $13 million. Still, the stock broke out powerfully from a flat base, surging 18% to 46.52, after the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss and a 21% rise in sales to $43.8 million.


AeroVironment's buy point was 40.20, but the stock gapped up over the buy point. In this case, buying as close to the open price is sound strategy. AeroVironment opened at 42.77, but it's too extended now.

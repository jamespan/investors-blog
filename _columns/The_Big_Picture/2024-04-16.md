  Stock Market Holds Up Despite Powell Admission; Why This Industry Group Bears Watching Now

An oversold stock market didn't move much Tuesday after some sharp selling Monday.




The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2%, helped by a strong earnings report from **UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)). The health insurer gapped up and rallied 5%, but the stock is still on a downtrend, with an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-accumulation-distribution-rating-shows-professionals-moves/) of E. Several weekly declines in above-average volume since late January, a sign of unequivocal institutional selling, hurt the rating.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 small-cap index ended with losses ranging from 0.1%. to 0.4%. The Nasdaq avoided a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), falling 0.1% in higher volume. But it was another distribution day for the S&P 500, which eased 0.2% in slightly higher volume.

The Nasdaq composite on Monday marked its seventh distribution day since March 14, prompting IBD to lower stock market exposure to 20%-40% invested. Besides an elevated distribution-day count, the stock market is also dealing with weak breadth and higher interest rates. All three factors are considerable headwinds for the stock market, along with tensions in the Middle East.


Breadth stayed weak, with decliners beating advancers on the NYSE and Nasdaq by nearly 2-to-1.


Stocks wobbled a bit around 1:30 p.m. ET after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that recent data has shown a lack of further progress on inflation. He's right about that. Last week, core consumer prices on a year-over-year basis came in above expectations for the fourth straight month.

The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up an additional 3 basis points to 4.66% as Wall Street ponders the prospects of interest rates staying higher for longer. The Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting interest rates this year, but the timing and number of cuts are still in question.


In late-afternoon trading Tuesday, [CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) showed a 70% chance that the first rate cut would come at the September meeting. By the end of the year, federal funds futures traders think there's a 56% chance that the fed funds rate will be at 4.75%-5%. That implies two quarter-point rate cuts between now and the end of the year.


Stocks To Watch
---------------


Earnings from **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)), one of several leaders in the chip equipment group, are due Wednesday before the open. What ASML says about future demand will likely move other top performers in the group like **KLA** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) and **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)). All three stocks are showing tight trading near their 10-week lines.


Lesser-known names in the group are in good setups as well, including **Onto Innovation** ([ONTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONTO)), **ACM Research** ([ACMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACMR)) and **Veeco Instruments** ([VECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VECO)).


Earnings from **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) early Thursday could also move chip stocks.


In the aerospace and defense group, **Heico** ([HEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HEI)) rallied to the top of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) and closed just below a 200.64 entry. Group peer **Howmet Aerospace** ([HWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HWM)) joined the [Leaderboard Watchlist](https://leaderboard.investors.com) Tuesday as it sets up in a flat base.


In the data storage group, **Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) is trading tightly and holding above its 10-week moving average after its earnings surge during the week ended March 1.



It's encouraging to see a number of good setups among leading growth stocks. It's also encouraging to see big stock market leaders like **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) holding above their 10-week lines.


While several stock market leaders are testing support at their 10-week lines for the first time, be careful not to buy stocks that have made multiple tests already.


**Celestica** ([CLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLS)) is a good example. The electronics contract manufacturer cleared a base in mid-June and has already found support at its 10-week line several times. At this point, it's best to wait for a new [base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) to form.

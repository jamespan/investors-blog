Capping a week of key news on the [economic](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) and [monetary policy front](https://www.investors.com/research/gold-stocks-investing-price/), further bloodletting in [Bitcoin](https://www.investors.com/research/coinbase-coin-stock-buy-now/), and signs of budding compromise inside the Beltway, major stock market indexes didn't move much on Friday. That could be a good sign.




For starters, consider the S&P 500. Amid Friday's mixed session, the large-cap index's drop of less than 0.1% capped a mild 0.4% drop for the week. But the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) offered a floor of support for a second week in a row. The S&P 500 finished well in the upper half of its weekly price range.


For a market uptrend currently under pressure, this is the kind of pullback to favor.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average and iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) pulled back from session highs but still ended mildly higher, up 0.3% to 0.4%. Their weekly chart action mirrored the S&P 500.


Stock Market Today: A Silver Lining?
------------------------------------


![MP052121](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MP052121-273x300.jpg)The Nasdaq fell nearly 0.5% on Friday. But volume fell, even as monthly and weekly options expired. This indicated a lack of heavy institutional selling pressure. Plus, the tech-fortified composite scraped up a 0.3% weekly gain. In recent weeks, the 8.5% drop from a February all-time high of 14,211 has helped serve to remove some speculative froth.


[Bullishness among newsletter writers](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) polled by Investors Intelligence fell to 54.5% this week, the lowest since early April.


At this point, what can you do to help determine if the uptrend will resume or if another leg down is around the corner? And what stocks or indexes may help you gain the conviction to deploy more or less capital?


Nine Charts To Watch
--------------------


* Nasdaq 100: Can megacap techs keep this current pullback milder than the one that began in February? Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) narrowly avoided a fifth straight weekly drop. A 0.8% gain would hoist the ETF back above its 10-week line.
* Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ([GBTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GBTC)): The Bitcoin-tracking fund got smashed again, down 24% the past week in heavy volume. Money flowed back into gold. Will gold miners turn into new leaders? **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) jumped 4% for the week, clearing a big saucer at 72.32.
* The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF: This index is broadly diversified, even if financial, health care, industrial and tech sectors dominate it. But growing confidence in the general economy should lead to additional buying in small-cap land.
* Europe: The iShares MSCI Germany ([EWG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWG)) is up nearly 12% year to date. That even beats the IBD Mutual Fund index, up 2.3% since Jan. 1 headed into Friday's trading. France equities are doing well too, with iShares MSCI France ([EWQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWQ)) up almost 16%. The market is embracing further signs of economic healing in the EU.
* Top growth stocks: Keep an eye on **LGI Homes** ([LGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGI)), a new bellwether for the homebuilding industry. This top stock is testing its 10-week line for the first time since breaking out. Software stocks are stabilizing; **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) cruised 7.6% higher for the week. **Snowflake** ([SNOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNOW)) is no leader today. But its 11% gain pushed shares above the 10-week moving average for the first time since December.

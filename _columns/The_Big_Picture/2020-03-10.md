Stock Market Correction Continues, But New Rally Attempt Kicks Off; Costco, Walmart Outperform
===============================================================================================

The major stock indexes snapped back from Monday's heavy losses in a volatile trading session, as the coronavirus stock market correction tried to find a floor. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite closed with a nearly 5% gain, kicking off a new rally attempt after President Donald Trump proposed a fiscal stimulus package to combat an economic slowdown.




Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rallied 4.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also ascended 4.9%, or 1,167 points. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.9%. Leading growth stocks also showed more modest gains: The IBD 50 rose 1.5%. Volume on both main exchanges was lower than Monday's session.


New Rally Attempt In Stock Market Correction
--------------------------------------------


On Feb. 25, IBD [downgraded the stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) to a market in correction. On Monday, the major indexes plunged to new correction lows, ending the previous rally attempt. On Tuesday, major stock indexes [gave up sharp gains](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-trump-coronavirus-stock-market-correction-continues-apple-stock/) in morning trade, underscoring the inherent volatility of the stock market correction.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MP031020-285x300.jpg)But the stock market strengthened through the latter part of the day, ending with strong gains at the day's highs. Indexes rallied in the final hour as news broke that the White House proposed a 0% payroll tax through the end of the year.


Tuesday serves as Day 1 of a new rally attempt. [Follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) typically occur on Day 4 or later, so the confirmation of a new uptrend could start as soon as Friday.


Until a follow-through happens, investors should be on the sidelines and in cash. But don't tune out. Instead, focus on updating your watchlists of potential stock market leaders. Currently, there aren't very many constructive formations among top growth stocks due to the sharp market weakness.


[Monday's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-correction-worsens-oil-prices-adds-problems/) noted the [put-call volume ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall) surged to 1.44. That's the highest since a 1.48 reading in December 2018 that marked the bottom of that year's brief bear market. On Tuesday, the ratio was a still-elevated 1.15.

Discount warehouse chain Costco is trading back above its 50-day line after falling as much as 16.6% from its 52-week high on Feb. 28. Costco stock moved up 2.5%.


[Dow Jones stock](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) Walmart continues to work on a consolidation with a 125.48 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The blue-chip stock was [Monday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/walmart-stock-hits-high-key-gauge-coronavirus-infects-stock-market/) as it shrugged off the stock market rout. Shares rallied 2.2% Tuesday.


Vipshop, a breakout stock last week, continues to hold up well amid the recent stock market weakness, as indicated by the strong relative strength line. The RS line hit a new high Monday, as the stock shrugged off the stock market sell-off to rise nearly 4%.


The Chinese discount retailer [was featured](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/vipshop-stock-breaks-out-buy-range/) as the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) last week, when the stock powered above a 15.07 buy point in a double bottom. On Tuesday, shares dropped nearly 2% but remained out of buy range.


Remember, all new buys are considered very risky during stock market corrections, but these leaders are exhibiting tremendous strength in a dismal market environment.

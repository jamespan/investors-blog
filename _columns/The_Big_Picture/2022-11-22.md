The stock market closed with strong gains and near session highs Tuesday as oil and gas stocks continued a recent stretch of outperformance. Meanwhile, earnings reports from **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) and **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)) fueled positive sentiment in the retail sector and eased concerns about a slowdown in holiday spending.




Best Buy gapped up despite reporting its fourth straight quarter of declining earnings and revenue. But the [results beat expectations](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/bby-stock-best-buy-beats-fiscal-q3-goals/), along with same-store sales, which fell less than expected. BBY stock jumped nearly 13% and closed just below the 200-day moving average.


Earnings growth declined again at Dick's Sporting Goods, but revenue increased 8% to $2.96 billion. The company also [raised its full-year earnings guidanc](https://www.investors.com/news/retail-stocks-dicks-dollar-tree-nordstrom-earnings-q3-2022/)e. DKS stock surged above its 50-day moving average, rising 10%. It's near the top of an 11-week consolidation.


**American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)), **Abercrombie & Fitch** ([ANF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANF)) and **Burlington Stores** ([BURL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BURL)) also rallied sharply on earnings.


Stock Market Today
------------------


The Dow Jones Industrial Average topped the 34,000 level, rising 1.2%, helped by strong performances from [retail stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/retail-and-e-commerce-stocks-and-industry-news) like **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Walgreens** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)). Dow Jones stock **Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) also outperformed in the stock market today, up 2.6%. CVX moved back into a buy zone from a 182.50 entry. It's the newest member of the [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) model portfolio.

At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures settled at $8o.95 a barrel, up 1.1%, after a volatile session Monday that saw oil hit its lowest level since the start of the year.


Oil fell sharply early Monday after published reports said that OPEC+ was considering boosting output by up to 500,000 barrels a day at the Dec. 4 meeting. But oil pared losses Monday after Saudi Arabia's energy minister denied the reports.


The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF ([XLE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLE)) jumped 3.1%. It's on the verge of retaking a 93.41 buy point. The Vanguard Energy ETF ([VDE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDE)) added 3.4%, closing just above a 130.45 entry.


The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite each rallied 1.4%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index gained 1.2%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq, while preliminary data showed slightly lower volume on the NYSE.


The S&P 500 looks ready to make another bid for the 4,000 level after getting turned away at the round number last week. Even if the index moves above 4,000, the 200-day moving average still looms large as a potential resistance level. The S&P 500 got turned away at its 200-day line in mid-August.


Advancing stocks beat decliners on the Nasdaq by less than 2-to-1. Breadth was better on the NYSE, with winners beating losers by nearly 3-to-1.


The good news for now is that indexes are still in [confirmed uptrends](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), with the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 holding above short-term support levels. After a low-volume pullback, the Nasdaq composite is just above the 11,000 level and its 50-day moving average.


Market Movers
-------------


A stock market tide flowing positively is usually good news for growth investors, but it's still a challenging environment for top-rated growth stocks.

[IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stock **Catalyst Pharmaceuticals** ([CPRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRX)) cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) with a 16.76 buy point. But then there's **Immunocore** ([IMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMCR)), which made some progress from a 62.92 entry. But shares reversed hard Monday and extended losses Tuesday before finding support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


**Acadia Healthcare** ([ACHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACHC)) tried to clear a 10-week consolidation Tuesday, but sellers knocked the stock off highs by the close. And **Mobileye**'s ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) breakout attempt from an IPO base was short-lived.


Make no mistake, though. There are plenty of stocks acting well as indexes aim for a strong finish to a challenging year.



Steel stocks outperformed. After Monday's breakout, **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) followed through, rising more than 2% Tuesday. Group peer **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)) jumped 4.3% and reclaimed a 34.19 buy point after finding support at its 21-day line Monday. IBD's steel producer group rallied about 3%.


**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) broke out from a big cup-with-handle base Tuesday, rising 1.6% to 81.26. It's still in the 5% buy zone from an 81.18 entry, but volume was very light.


While it's fine putting money to work in the current stock market, keep your exposure on the conservative side with small positions to start. Just because the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend doesn't mean you have to be 100% invested. And don't be afraid to take a 10% gain if you have it, given the choppy nature of the market.


As more institutional money comes in from the sidelines, the crop of successful breakouts and bullish moves from top-rated growth stocks should improve. But with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 still below their 200-day lines, it's best to proceed cautiously.

The stock market ended sharply lower Friday after the Centers for Disease Control confirmed the second U.S. case of the Chinese coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 317 points before trimming the loss by the close.




The Nasdaq composite closed with a 0.9% loss after rising as much as 0.5% earlier in the session. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also ended with a 0.9% decrease and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, or 170 points, closing just below the 29,000 price level. An [8.1% advance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/intel-earnings-q4-2019-intc-stock/) in **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) shares propped up the blue chip index. The IBD 50 — a computerized list of leading growth stocks — lost 0.75%. Volume was solidly higher on the Nasdaq, and a touch lower on the NYSE.

Stock Market Ends Week On Down Note
-----------------------------------


The Nasdaq added a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/), raising its count to two. The S&P 500 barely avoided one. The Nasdaq's price action was particularly bearish given the outside reversal day. The Nasdaq traded above Thursday's high price (into record territory), while closing below Thursday's low.

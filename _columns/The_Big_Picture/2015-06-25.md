Stocks' Apathy Could Be Tied To Buyback Silent Period
======================================================

A flurry of economic data and news Thursday failed to excite an apathetic market. The Nasdaq slipped less than 0.2%, while the S&P 500 sagged 0.3%. The IBD 50 outperformed, rising 0.5%. Volume was higher on both major exchanges.

  

Although health-related stocks popped higher on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in favor of ObamaCare, few stock groups followed the medical sector's lead. Apart from the medical groups, only seven out of 197 industry groups rose 1% or more.

  

Economic data were mostly positive but also failed to trigger a broad reaction. Jobless claims were slightly fewer than feared. Personal income and consumer spending in May were stronger than expected. The Kansas City Fed's manufacturing index improved in June, yet only by posting a less negative number.

  

On the negative side, the PMI's services flash reading for June was below the consensus view.

  

Technically, the S&P 500 suffered another quiet distribution day, while the Nasdaq shed the May 20 stalling day because of time. Yet, for all the distribution since the uptrend was confirmed on May 14, the indexes are only 1% to 1.5% off their highs.

  

What accounts for the recent sluggishness? Greece is an easy scapegoat, but there might be something more routine at work.

  

As Goldman Sachs has pointed out in the past, corporate buybacks are suspended during the five weeks before a company reports results. Quarterly results will begin rolling in during the first full week of July, which means many companies are in the inactive period now.

  

The pause in corporate buying could be leaving the market without one of its key props. Fortunately, that's temporary.

  

Two other factors are worth noting in [the current stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today).

  

Some rotation is evident, as reflected by the sectors with the most new highs. The banking sector has been the chief leader since early June. Previously, the medical sector had dominated the new highs list.

  

Also, a secondary gauge seems to favor the bulls. The percentage of NYSE stocks above their 200-day moving average hit a year-to-date low of 43% on Jan. 15. A rally followed. On June 9, the gauge again sank to the 2015 low of 43%. A similar rebound appears to be under way.

  

On Friday, the annual rebalancing of the Russell stock indexes will take place. The rebalancing normally leads to heavy volume for the affected stocks.

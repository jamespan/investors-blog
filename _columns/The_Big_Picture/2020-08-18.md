[Stocks today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) illustrated again how the market always seeks to look forward, not backward.




Two major indexes struck new all-time highs Tuesday, while FAANG firms and other seemingly indomitable megacap techs attracted more fund-manager money. Yet, overall market leadership continues to indicate that it's broadening, not narrowing.


While the S&P 500 topped news headlines as it rose 0.2% to 3389, posting a new all-time closing high, in reality the Nasdaq continued to take charge.


The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.7% to mark its fourth gain in five sessions. A new all-time high of 11,230 on Tuesday also represents a 14% climb from the tech-powered index's February peak of 9838. That was right before coronavirus-induced institutional selling tackled the market and purged gains accumulated since the beginning of 2019.


Now, how does this contrast with the S&P 500's Tuesday achievement? While making a historic recovery from the nearly six-week, 35.4% trampling that ended on March 23, the large-cap benchmark has merely gotten a few ticks above its own February peak of 3393.


Volume rose on the NYSE and ended virtually flat on the Nasdaq.


The Nasdaq, meanwhile, knocked out a July 21 distribution day based on the 5% rule: That is, the index had to rise 5% from that distribution day's closing price, or 11,214. Thus, the [distribution-day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) remains at a manageable level, as the Market Pulse shows.

Indeed, the Nasdaq's outperformance shines even brighter when you assess the action of additional equity indexes.


Unlike the S&P 500's new high day, NYSE Composite still trades nearly 9% off its 52-week peak. Midcaps, as narrated by the S&P MidCap 400, in general still trade around 8% below all-time highs. The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) exchange traded fund slid 1% on Tuesday. The ETF boasts a 9.2% lift since July 1. But it also needs to rally another 10.9% to reach its all-time high going back to August of 2018.


Innovator IBD 50 ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) saw its rally stall Tuesday. Yet the growth stock-focused ETF is stealthily clawing back near its 52-week high of 38.41, seen on Aug. 7. It's now just a 2% rise away from taking out its all-time peak of 38.79, set on Oct. 1, 2018.


Stocks Today: Feeding Off Bullish New Data
------------------------------------------


Terrific July housing starts data seems to affirm the smart moves in building and construction products stocks lately. And Tuesday's report was no small beat. A jump in starts to almost 1.5 million homes on an annualized rate pounded the [Econoday consensus view](https://research.investors.com/economic-calendar/) of 1.24 million. It also easily topped the most bullish view of 1.32 million.


This huge beat is not a one-off event.


Do you recall when the market got energized by the shocking rebound in May payrolls? Plus, some portfolio managers have noted that the 17-year-old Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (CESI) made record highs by the end of the second quarter.


"Essentially, the market's swift rebound has been commensurate with the degree of economic outperformance, as measured by the CESI," Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Life Wealth Management, wrote in a recent note to clients.


Yet here's a curious divergence: Losers beat winners on the Nasdaq on Tuesday by more than a 3-2 margin. On the NYSE, the ratio was nearly 5 to 4. Cyclical, energy and banking names got bruised on Tuesday.


But many more stocks continue to ratchet new highs vs. new lows. (Keep track of the daily totals at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).)


Plus, breakouts are working, for the most part â€” even in the non-tech sectors.



**Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)), highlighted in a recent [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A), shows a 4% gain since clearing a 182.65 [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). So, it's still [in buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/). **T-Mobile U.S.** ([TMUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMUS)) fell 0.7% on Tuesday, but it too is holding within the [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) after a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) past 111.68 in a six-week flat base. The stock belongs to the No. 8-ranked [Telecom sector](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-aug-17-2020/) headed into Tuesday's trading.


**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) fell 1% but the discount retailing and e-commerce titan (revenue jumped 11% in the April-ended fiscal first quarter to $19.6 billion) still stands extended outside the 5% buy zone after a breakout from a saucer with handle at 126.07. The 5% buy zone goes up to 132.37.


Is This Going To Remain A Global Rally?
---------------------------------------



Tuesday also showcased, in a quiet way, emerging new leaders in emerging markets: from silicon wafer supplier **Daqo New Solar** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) to China online shopping giant **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) to Singapore's video game innovator **Sea Ltd.** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)). Don't ignore **StoneCo** ([STNE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STNE)), either. A breakout past 42.98 in a [large, deep cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/) is bearing fruit. The payments technology firm in Brazil has been rising since its decision to merge with **Linx** ([LINX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LINX)).


Both Sea and the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 ([ASHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASHR)) ETF got the early limelight in [Tuesday's IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A).


No doubt, China remains in sharp focus, and it's vital to understand how its economy is changing too.


Despite threats by the White House to expand sanctions on major Chinese firms, investors seem to yawn on such "news." **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) remains above several buy points in a cup with handle, and is now forming a flat base with a 268.10 buy point. **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)), the owner of Wechat, is having a tougher time bouncing off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


The latest front-cover story in The Economist, titled "Xi's New Economy: Don't Underestimate It," notes exports are making a smaller portion of China's economy. The magazine also wrote, "the days of supersized fiscal and lending binges are over. Banks have been forced to recognize off-balance-sheet activity and build up buffers."


Be Wary Of Complacency
----------------------


The VIX, or the [Cboe market volatility index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), rallied nearly 1.6% after falling 3% on Monday. The contrarian indicator's Monday close of 21.35 registered the lowest since 17.08 on Feb. 21, just before the market went into "uptrend under pressure" on Feb. 24.

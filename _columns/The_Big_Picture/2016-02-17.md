Stocks shot higher Wednesday and the major indexes posted hefty gains for a third straight session, delivering a follow-through in the process.


But the stock market paled in the areas of outstanding breakouts and the number of highly rated stocks running to new highs. For those reasons, it would appear that caution and patience are still two very good cards to hold in your hand.


The Nasdaq composite gapped up for a second straight day. Wednesday's 2.2% gain in sharply higher volume marked a follow-through -- the earliest signal that an important market bottom may be in the works.


![MP021816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MP021816-266x300.jpg)It was a follow-through on the fourth day of a rally attempt, not Day 3: IBD Market School rules point to the Feb. 11 session as the start of the new rally. While the Nasdaq fell 0.4% that day, it bounced sharply off the day's low and finished well in the upper half of its intraday range. Such unusual action can count as the start of a new market rally attempt. That's significant, because a follow-through should occur starting with the fourth day of a rally attempt, no sooner.


The S&P 500 rallied nearly 1.7% in heavier turnover. It too staged a follow-through of its own, although it did not see as vigorous a rebound during its decline on Feb. 11.


Careful readers of this column know that over the past two years, numerous follow-through days did not lead to long-lasting uptrends. The poor action that followed the Jan. 26 session and a rare Day 3 follow-through on Dec. 16 testify to the challenges of making money lately. The S&P 500's follow-through on Oct. 2 lasted much longer.


Heart valve replacement maker **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) and Mexico's low-cost airline **Volaris** ([VLRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLRS)) stood out. Both stocks broke out past their 83.53 and 19.22 buy points, respectively, in heavy trade. They both notched new highs (see the entire list, still looking like a raisin in the sun, in IBD on B5). But a true rally is going to need a lot more stocks like these two.


**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) helped the cause, gapping up 11% in triple normal trade and grabbing hold of its 200-day moving average. But the longtime leader is nowhere close to completing a decent base. IBD 50 names **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)), **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)) and **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) as well as IBD Global Leaders standout **Genpact** ([G](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=G)) are acting right as they build the right side of their respective bases.


Another big rally in crude oil past $30 a barrel, a bigger than expected uptick in January U.S. wholesale prices, and a 0.9% jump in U.S. industrial production in January helped breathe life into the bulls.


At the same time, the Federal Reserve hinted it would be highly cautious about making any future hikes in short-term borrowing rates. In the minutes released from the Jan. 26-27 meeting on interest rates, the U.S. central bank noted that domestic financial conditions had "tightened" during the start of the new year and judged the vulnerability of the U.S. financial system as "moderate on balance."

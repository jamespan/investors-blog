Commodities, Thrashed All Year, Lead Broad Advance
===================================================

IBD readers would not be surprised to see the phrase "Santa Claus rally" used to describe strong gains this time of year. Yet the reindeer pulling the market up Wednesday were perhaps not the ones you would have hoped for or expected.


The Nasdaq rose 0.9% in higher trade. The S&P 500 posted a 1.2% gain for its biggest up day since Dec. 16's rare Day 3 follow-through. NYSE turnover fell.


These gains were not driven by the Internets, chipmakers, airlines, specialty consumer firms or even small banking names that have helped the market make several tradeable upswings in 2015.


Rather, think of industry groups that have been thrown under the bus all year: oil and gas, metals and other commodity-driven issues. They stole the spotlight for the day on news of a surprise drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.


The U.S. exploration and production industry group jumped 8.2% on Wednesday. Care to guess how many stocks in the 95-member group feature an IBD Composite Rating of 90 or higher? Zero. How about 50 or higher? Zilch.

The stock is still languishing below both its 50- and 200-day moving averages and is 54% off a 52-week peak of 53.65.


One of the day's positive features was the S&P 500's quickly snapping back following the harsh sell-offs on Thursday and Friday of last week. It's recouped much of its 4.1% drop in the prior two weeks. The S&P 500 also stepped above its 200-day moving average, which continues to inch lower.


Yet the environment for CAN SLIM practitioners remains challenging. Investors who have ridden solid gains in megacap techs, including **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), deserve a warm pat on the back. All three hold a spot in IBD's [Leaderboard](http://news.investors.com/products/premium-investing-tools/leaderboard/).


The reversal by **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) ($110 billion market cap) shares following solid fiscal Q2 results was disappointing but not surprising. The leading sports apparel company has made a big run since its Sept. 5, 2014, breakout near 80. The stock has made more than seven pullbacks to the 50-day line since then.


Investor sentiment remains pessimistic. That's a long-term positive. The latest survey of newsletter writers by Investors Intelligence shows bulls dropping to 36.7%. (See Page B11.) So nearly two-thirds of market pundits still expect a significant correction or say that a bear market is nigh.

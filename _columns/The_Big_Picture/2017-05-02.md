 The stock market eked out small gains Tuesday in another constructive session for the bulls, as major stock indexes continue to trade tightly and hold near highs.  

The Dow Jones industrial average led the way, rising 0.2%, as it sits just below the 21,000 level. It's been a tough nut to crack so far for the blue-chip index. **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) outperformed with gains of more than 1%. Visa benefited from strong earnings from **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) that were reported early Tuesday.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MP0050217-177x300.png)The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 picked up 0.1% each as the Nasdaq touched another all-time high. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.6%. The [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/) ended mostly flat.  Volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE rose about 20% from Monday's levels.


While the Nasdaq composite continues to hold comfortably above the 6000 level, the 2400 level for the S&P 500 is posting resistance. The Russell 2000, meanwhile, gave up the 1400 level after five straight closes above it.


Declining stocks and advancing stocks were equally matched on the NYSE, while decliners had a tiny edge over advancers on the Nasdaq.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) didn't stir much excitement in Tuesday's after-house session as [earnings topped expectations while revenue missed slightly](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-beats-views-on-earnings-comes-up-short-on-sales/). Shares slipped around 1.5% in after-hours trading after rising 0.6% during regular trading. Apple ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash.


The two-day Fed meeting got underway today and a decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. There's not much of a chance of a rate hike at this meeting, but odds have been increasing for a rate hike at the June meeting — even amid sluggish first-quarter GDP growth reported last week and recent disappointing readings on monthly retail sales.


Judging by the way the stock market has been acting lately, a dovish tone from the Fed on Wednesday seems more likely than a hawkish one at this point.


Tuesday's session served up some breakouts, including one from **Coach** ([COH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COH)). It gapped up over a 41.80 cup-with-handle buy point after reporting earnings. Coach's technical picture is strong but fundamentals at this point don't quite pass muster, which hurts the stock's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 34.


Another big gainer was **Martin Marietta** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)). Shares gapped up and surged nearly 8% after earnings smashed expectations. The stock tried for a breakout over a 244.08 buy point but came up just short. Group peer **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) also did well, rising 4%.


In other news, after soaring nearly 13% last week, shares of **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) jumped 4%, bringing this week's gain to nearly 11%, after Mark Cuban said in a CNBC interview that he's been buying the stock as an artificial-intelligence play. With Twitter still about 27% off its high, a buy point isn't exactly straightforward, although aggressive traders might have opted to buy when Twitter broke out over a trend line last week.


With the market in a confirmed uptrend, there's nothing wrong with nibbling at high-quality names near buy points. If they quickly become profitable, that's the market's way of saying that the buy was well-timed. If you're sitting on a loss soon after buying, though, always be careful not to let a manageable loss get worse. One of the key traits of all successful growth-stock investors is keeping losses small.


On the other hand, investors with a profit in **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) have a decision to make before its earnings report Wednesday after the close: Take full profits, take partial profit or let the position ride through earnings. The most conservative move would be to lock in a gain. Taking half-profits isn't bad strategy, either. For those who bought when Tesla cleared a cup-shaped base with a 287.49 buy point in early April, the gain is now around 11% — not a huge profit but a decent short-term gain.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded Monday in a bit of relief from its worst week so far this year. Still, the stock market has some repairing  to do.




Indexes pared gains in the final hour of trading, but still booked a solid advance. The Nasdaq composite led a broad bounce with a 1.1% gain. The index broke a six-day losing streak, its longest since December 2022.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 climbed 0.9%, ending its longest losing streak since October 2022. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%. Volume fell on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.


Monday's gains were broad, an encouraging sign if the stock market rebound continues. Advancing stocks led decliners by a 7-to-4 ratio on the Nasdaq and by 8-to-5 on the NYSE. All 11 S&P sector indexes rose.


To illustrate the market's broad haul, the Russell 2000 small-cap index — along with exchange traded funds First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight ([QQEW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQEW)), Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ([RSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSP)), Roundhill Magnificent Seven ([MAGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAGS)), iShares Russell 1000 Growth ([IWF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWF)) and iShares Russell 1000 Value ([IWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWD)) — joined the major indexes with gains of 0.8% to 1%.


Meanwhile, the IBD 50 index outperformed with a 1.6% jump.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MP042224.jpg)While the rebound was welcome, it wasn't much of a surprise. Indexes were oversold by some measures. [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)'s short-term overbought-oversold oscillator, for example, had reached its most oversold level since the late-October market bottom.


Investors looking for a bottoming area on index charts will notice that Monday's rebound didn't line up with any clear support levels. Yet, the S&P 500 rebounded above the 5,000 level after falling below it Friday. And for what it's worth, the Dow is finding some support around the 38,000 level.


The rest of this week's action in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq will offer clues on the market's ultimate direction.


Best Stock Market Move: Cash
----------------------------


On Friday, [IBD cut its recommended market exposure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-sell-off-nasdaq-sp500-pce-inflation-data-netflix-tesla-nvidia-super-micro/) to the lowest rung of 0% to 20%. That means investors should avoid buying stocks and raise cash. That's the best move investors can make right now.


Be sure to sell any stock that falls more than 7% below your purchase price, and perhaps even less. Watch out for stocks that break the 10-week moving average, and [other sell signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/). Taking profits is a smart move, as is a move to get off margin trades.


Monday's rebound was the start of a rally attempt, at least in theory. As long as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq stay above Monday's lows, investors can start looking for [a rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) as early as Thursday.


That happens to be the day **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) report earnings, so bullish results could see the market rally Friday. In fact, this is the [biggest week for first-quarter tech earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/meta-stock-holds-strong-earnings-dexcom-earnings/).


But remember that cash is the best investment now that trades in artificial intelligence stocks and the market's backbone were torn to shreds last week. Magnificent Seven stocks lost $950 billion in market cap, their largest weekly loss ever, according to Dow Jones Market Data.


Mag 7 players **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)), Microsoft and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) — along with **Super Micro Computer** ([SMCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMCI)) — remain below their 50-day moving averages. **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), the nation's largest bank, is trying to regain its 50-day line.


But in another hopeful sign, some institutional-quality stocks are finding support at their 50-day averages, including drilling-equipment maker **Weatherford International** ([WFRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFRD)), **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)). All those stocks are in the IBD 50.


Market Was Overdue For A Break
------------------------------


Ned Davis Research seemed to confirm the change in trend was almost inevitable.


In a report from the investment research firm last week, Chief U.S. Strategist Ed Clissold and Senior Quantitative Analyst Thanh Nguyen said the S&P 500 had not endured a 3% decline since last October. That was the longest stretch since a 308-day streak that ended Jan. 26, 2018.


The S&P 500's surge of 25.3% in the five months through March 31 was only the seventh time the index has gained more than 25% over a five-month span since World War II. That usually bodes well for the stock market. On average, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 6.1% three months later and 7% six months later. Notably, all previous 25% five-month runs followed a cyclical bear market, except this year.


Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, offered some data on the unusually long losing streak in the stock market.


Historically, the S&P 500 climbs an average 1.1% one month after the six-day losing streak, and 3.7% three months later. The average 12-month returns after the S&P 500 goes through six straight declines are around 13%, with 79% of occurrences yielding positive results.

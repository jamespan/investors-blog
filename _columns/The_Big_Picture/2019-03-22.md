After Bears Maul Stocks, Here's What To Do Now
===============================================

Stock indexes suffered a savage beating Friday, as defensive groups were among the day's only winners.




The Nasdaq careened 2.5% lower, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 dived 3.6%.


Volume rose on both major exchanges vs. the previous session.


The action was nasty enough to add [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) to the Nasdaq and S&P 500 and to knock the market outlook to uptrend under pressure.


Money Shifts To Cautious Plays
------------------------------


On the day's upside, food, utilities, gold miners and homebuilders rose.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MP032219-261x300.jpg)Homebuilders are benefiting from lower mortgage rates and rising U.S. wages. Existing-home sales for February came in at 5.51 million, about 8% higher than expected and above every estimate in the range.


While homebuilder stocks were mostly up for the day, volume was below average. For example, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) rose 1.2% in volume about 30% below average. The lackluster volume suggests funds weren't driving the price gains.


Losing Groups 19-To-1 Over Winners
----------------------------------


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, losers led winners by an almost 19-1 ratio. Big losers included specialty steel, plastics, oil equipment and superregional banks.


What triggered the avalanche of selling?


There were no shortage of suspects, according to the media. Suspects included weak manufacturing data in Europe, chaos surrounding Brexit, fears of an inverted yield curve and reports that Clete Willems, a top U.S. trade negotiator in the Trump administration, is resigning.


Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury slid 9 basis points to 2.45%, the lowest level since January 2018. The yield on the 3-month Treasury bill Friday was slightly higher than the yield on the 10-year Treasury note.


Another factor was President Trump's comments on trade, which cut both ways. Trump said in a Fox Business Network interview aired Friday that an agreement on trade with China "will probably happen." But he also threw an elbow Europe's way, saying the European Union "treats us as badly as China" does.


Look To The Chart
-----------------


What should investors do now?


With the market uptrend under pressure, investors need to be more cautious. Limit stock purchases to stocks in which you have high confidence. Taking some profits to reduce exposure is a good idea.


Many IBD-style investors have probably already taken profits, a move that was advocated as recently as [Feb. 26 in Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/), [March 4 in Stock Spotlight](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/when-to-sell-stocks-market-leader-kirkland/) and [March 6 in the Big Cap 20](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-big-cap-20/large-caps-stock-market-profit-taking/).


IBD's key to selling is dictated by the stock chart. A profit of 20% should in most cases be taken. A profit that threatens to go negative should also be taken. Losses should be stopped at minus-7% to minus-8% at worst, much lower if possible.


Note that none of these sell rules have anything to do with a stock's fundamentals. The fundamentals are relevant on the buy side.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher Thursday, as Wall Street prepared to shift its attention to Friday's pivotal November jobs report.




Stock market leader **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) stock **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and tech titan **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) are stocks to buy and watch in the ongoing uptrend.


Early Thursday, first-time jobless claims for the week ended Dec. 2 rose to 220,000 vs. 218,000 in the previous week.

McGrath is chief investment officer for NorthEnd Private Wealth.


McGrath continued, "This morning's unemployment claims were more or less in line with expectations, which based on ADP's number, really puts a lot of weight into Friday's jobs number. Will ADP be accurate or will we see a very large number in need of revision in January?"


Early Friday, the Labor Department's employment report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect the jobs report to show a net gain of 180,000 jobs, including 150,000 in the private sector. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 3.9% as average hourly wage growth ticks down to 4% vs. a year earlier.

Stock Market Today
------------------


On Thursday, the indexes finished higher, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%. The S&P 500 held more solid gains, rising 0.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the way with a 1.4% advance. That places all three major stock indexes near the highs of their recent trading ranges.


Finally, the small-cap Russell 2000 climbed 0.9%.


Volume rose on the Nasdaq, but appeared to be lower on the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday's session.


Inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average, **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) surged more than 7%, but still was about 46% off its 52-week high. On the downside, **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) declined 1.7%, as the drug giant continues to consolidate about 13% off its old highs.


And top growth stocks moved up modestly, as the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) gained 0.15%. Inside the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Carnival PLC** ([CUK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUK)) rallied 3.1%, extending a win streak to nine sessions and moving closer to a cup base's 17.67 buy point.

What To Do Now
--------------


IBD recommends an exposure level of 80% to 100%, with the stock market rally near the highs of its recent trading range. If you're making progress in your portfolio, then the top of that range makes sense. But if you're starting to give back some recent progress, then it makes sense to reduce some exposure.


Finally, it's also OK to reduce exposure by taking some profits when leading stocks hit their 20%-25% profit zones.


Meanwhile, more leading stocks are breaking out. And a great resource for daily breakouts is [IBD MarketSmith's](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) "Breaking Out Today" list.

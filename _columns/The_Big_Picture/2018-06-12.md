title: Nasdaq Climbs To Record High, And This Other Index Also Hits New High

The Nasdaq composite demonstrated again why it's the leading stock index, not only outperforming the other main indexes Tuesday but also hitting a record high.




The Nasdaq climbed 0.6% as it topped its previous peak of 7697, marked last Thursday. The composite's titans such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) didn't move much. But there was strength in solar energy, software and biotech industry groups that helped the composite reach its new high.


After Tuesday's gains, the Nasdaq is up 11.6% for the year, far outpacing the S&P 500's 4.2% advance. The Nasdaq is lapping the Dow Jones industrial average by an even larger margin. Last year, the Nasdaq also had a big lead on the rival indexes.


On Tuesday, the S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Dow closed a fraction lower. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was indicated higher on the NYSE.

The Russell 2000 added 0.5% and also made a record high. The Russell has impressed with a 10.2% rally from its May 1 low. The S&P 400 midcap index also hit a new high, up 0.2%.


Tuesday's market made a U-turn. Indexes weakened starting midday until buyers stepped up in the final hour of trading. That enabled the main indexes to close near session highs. There was no clear explanation for the turn.


If the S&P 500 and Dow were subdued, it may reflect some caution ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate announcement Wednesday afternoon. Wall Street also is keeping an eye on the European Central Bank, which may announce the end of its bond-buying program. The Treasury market was quiet Tuesday.


Investors are expecting a quarter-point increase in the fed funds rate after the Fed meets. But the real story will be in the Fed's policy statement, which may contain clues on future rate hikes. Selling has flared up in the past when the central bank suggested it may raise rates four times this year, rather than the three it has signaled.


The market had practically no reaction to the U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore Tuesday. Although short on specifics, the two nations agreed on a broad plan for the "denuclearization" of North Korea. About the only consequence was a drop in defense stocks. IBD's aerospace and defense industry group fell 0.8%, leaving it in the bottom 12 groups for the day.

Leading stocks, including some internet and technology companies, performed well. The IBD 50 added 1.3%, sharply outperforming the market. The stature of leading stocks helps offset any concerns about the number of [distribution days](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/). The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have five each, although indexes have hardly been harmed.


**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) and **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), two leaders in the internet content industry group, led the IBD 50.


Twitter vaulted 5% after JPMorgan raised the price target to 50 from 39. The stock is now more than 20% above its 33.88 entry from a cup with handle. Grubhub rose nearly 5% to expand the gain from its 105.78 buy point. Software and other internet stocks added to the IBD 50's advance.


Retail and consumer stocks continue to act well. **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) was one of the latest examples, soaring nearly 31% after the upscale furniture chain beat earnings views and raised 2018 guidance.


**Land's End** ([LE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LE)) soared 27% as it broke out of a base in huge volume. The stock gapped past the 24.05 buy point after the apparel company beat profit expectations.


**Weight Watchers** ([WTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTW)) gapped up to a gain of nearly 6% after JPMorgan initiated coverage with an overweight rating — certainly no pun intended.

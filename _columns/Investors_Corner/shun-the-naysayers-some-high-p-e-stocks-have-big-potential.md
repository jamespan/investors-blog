Stock market myths abound and, unfortunately, many of them keep investors from reaping big profits in the market.

A big one says to avoid stocks with high P-E (price-to-earnings) ratios because they’re too expensive. Many ask, "Why buy a stock trading near a high with a P-E of 50 when you can buy one near a low with a P-E of 10 or 15?"

Think of a high P-E stock like a car. You could pay \$5,000 for a used car with 149,000 miles on it or you could ante up and pay \$40,000 for a high-quality new car. Which one has the better chance of giving you more bang for your buck? The latter of course.

It works the same way in the stock market. Many low P-E stocks are damaged goods. They’re on the bargain rack for good reason. Conversely, high P-E stocks are the premium merchandise in the stock market. In many cases, big earnings and sales growth is fueling big market-share gains, so these stocks command a premium valuation.

So contrary to conventional wisdom, stocks with high P-E ratios can deliver explosive gains. But they can be risky -- a slight earnings and sales miss, or lukewarm guidance, could result in a sharp sell-off. So losses on every stock investment must be cut at 8% or less.

A stock's trailing P-E ratio is based on past earnings and its forward P-E is based on earnings estimates for the current or next full year. The average trailing P-E of stocks in the S&P 500 was recently 18. Compare that to the average trailing P-E of 28 in a recent IBD 50 screen. Faster-growing firms are found in the IBD 50, so it makes sense that the average P-E ratio would be higher.

## When To Own High P-E Stocks

There are better times than others to own high P-E stocks. One scenario in which they have a good chance of working is after a meaningful market correction. A big enough pullback is often enough to shake out every last seller in the market. That paves the way for new institutional money to come in from the sidelines. Growth-fund managers aren’t afraid to pay up for a stock, especially if there’s a bona fide growth story.

The Leaders List has yielded some big winners in recent years, when market pundits were calling them “expensive.” **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), added to [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) in February just before it gapped up over a 90.03 buy point, has been a standout performer. Its P-E ratio at the time was 37. Expensive? Sure, but the market is optimistic that its Sapien 3 heart valve is still in the early stages of growth.

**Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) got the nod for Leaderboard when it soared out of a base in late May 2014. At the time, it had a trailing P-E ratio of 187. Pricey? Sure, but it more than doubled in price in less than a year thanks to huge earnings and sales growth, and expanding market share in the network security software space.

**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) joined Leaderboard when it broke out powerfully in July 2013. At the time, it was selling at 45 times trailing earnings, but there was a major growth story going on at the time and optimism about future growth. Facebook more than doubled in price over the next year. Its growth story is still very much intact.

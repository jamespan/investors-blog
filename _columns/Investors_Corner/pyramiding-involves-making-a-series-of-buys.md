  Use Pyramiding Into A Full Position To Reduce Risk

Jumping into a crystal-clear pool can be a lot of fun. But it's no fun if that water is icy cold.

  

It's best to test the water before fully committing, which is also a wise thing to do in investing. This is essentially the idea behind pyramiding, or buying a stock — even a good one — in installments.

  

If you find a true market leader to add to your portfolio, resist putting on your entire position at once. Instead, start by using a portion of your capital for the trade and build up into a full position. Add shares only if the stock moves in your favor.

  

Pyramiding is a strategic way of entering into a trade that reduces risk. While putting on a full position at once can make you more money if you are right, you can also lose more this way if you're not.

  

For example, if you put \$15,000 to work to buy 300 shares of a \$50 stock, you stand to lose \$1,200 if the stock falls 8%. But if you start with half of the \$15,000, you stand to lose less.

  

With the pyramiding technique, you build up to a full position by making a series of three separate purchases.

  

On your first buy, use 50% of your allocated capital. So if you have \$10,000 to invest, use \$5,000 for your initial position. If the stock moves 2% to 2.5% above your initial purchase price, use 30% of your allotted capital for your second buy.

  

Finally, if the stock moves up another 2% to 2.5% from your second buy point, use the remaining 20% of your allocated capital for your final purchase. Now you're fully invested, and hopefully the stock continues to move as intended.

  

While it takes more work, pyramiding is a smart way to enter a stock; you're only putting more money to work as a stock goes higher. Pyramiding is averaging up, or the opposite of the losing proposition of averaging down.

  

On Jan. 28, 2013, **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) cleared a 155.40 buy point from a shallow cup in huge volume. This marked the time for an initial buy. On the same day, the stock moved 2.5% from the 155.40 trigger, or to 159.29, on Feb. 6, giving investors a chance to add shares.

  

The jump on Feb. 6 also pushed the fast-growing maker of therapies for complex diseases another 2.5% from the 159.29 second entry, or to 163.27, providing a final purchase point **1**.

  

Biogen Idec went on to be a solid performer. It rallied 56% by late May before pulling back to its 50-day moving average.

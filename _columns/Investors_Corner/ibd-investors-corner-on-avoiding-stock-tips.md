If you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself.

That's an adage that's true for many things, and it helps explain one of IBD's reasons for being.

The newspaper and its sister products Investors.com, Leaderboard and MarketSmith all aim to give investors the tools to succeed in the stock market.

The idea is that if you want your nest egg to grow nicely, then you might want to manage at least some of it on your own.

It will require doing your homework and making use of some sophisticated tools, and it won't be easy. But as many longtime IBD readers will tell you, you can end up glad that you took a do-it-yourself approach.

The key is to stick completely to an investing strategy like IBD's CAN SLIM system. Follow time-tested rules and have a clear game plan.

What you don't want to do is rely on tips. It doesn't matter whether it's a tip from your neighbor, a Wall Street analyst or a Twitter pro with a huge following. Don't just embrace the advice, but instead do your own research.

One problem with tipsters is they have a tendency only to tell you when to buy a hot stock, but not when to sell it. That's partly why you've got to do your own homework, know your game plan and use sound sell rules.

Analysts in general don't have a great track record, and they are notorious for being loathe to slap a sell rating on any stock.

IBD's founder and chairman, William O'Neil, has detailed analysts' shortcomings at length in his book, "How to Make Money in Stocks."

For example, he wrote: "In 2008, some Wall Street analysts recommended buying **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) all the way down."

Or consider **Baidu's** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) action earlier this year. The Chinese Web search king is trading 26% off its recent March peak of 154.15.

The former market leader staged a brief recovery in early August, **1** but for the most part it's been wallowing well off that March high. You would not have wanted to buy the stock in late April, just before the sell-off picked up.

But some analysts were upgrading the stock to a buy rating in late April, **2** saying it would gain 20%. It might eventually, but so far it's lagged the general market.

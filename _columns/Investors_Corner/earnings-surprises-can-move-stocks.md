Sometimes, there's no simple explanation as to why a stock rose or fell during a single session. But in the case of breakouts, many times it's positive earnings surprises that provide the fuel for a big rally's fire.

An earnings surprise occurs when a company reports per-share profits outside of what was expected by the investment community. A positive surprise occurs when a firm reports earnings per share above consensus estimates from providers such as Thomson Reuters, S&P Capital IQ and FactSet Research Systems. A negative surprise happens when a firm posts bottom-line results below analysts' expectations.

Profit surprises and raised profit outlooks, plus comments from influential analysts and regulatory rulings, can have big impacts on stocks.

**Game Changer**

The Securities & Exchange Commission enacted [Regulation FD](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm) (Fair Disclosure) in 2000 to help address the selective disclosure of these items and other information that can move a stock. Company management is now barred from revealing material information about the business or financial results to a select audience. "Quiet periods" ahead of a quarterly report are now commonplace.

Since [strong earnings growth](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/763820-top-stocks-have-strong-profit-outlook.htm) is one of the main drivers of a stock's performance. There's little reason to buy shares in a company that is not making money.

A company that beats views is telling you that business is better than expected. Results were beyond what analysts using fundamental models predicted. This good news creates big demand for shares.

A company that posts a surprising profit when it was expected to lose money can see its shares skyrocket, such as [e-commerce giant](http://news.investors.com/technology/072415-763280-amazon-stock-amzn-hits-record-high-on-q2-earnings.htm) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) did after the close July 23. Shares shot up 17% in extended trading after the company reported a Q2 profit of 19 cents a share vs. an expected loss of 14 cents. Amazon.com finished the July 24 trading session with a 10% gain.

Sometimes, an earnings beat will move a stock a few percentage points at the open. Other times, a stock will gap sharply higher in heavy volume as institutions applaud the better-than-expected results. In most cases, IBD stresses not to buy once a stock gets to be more than 5% past a buy point.

But huge gap-ups out of bases mark an exception to the rule. While scary, it's fine to buy on a big gap-up past a base's buy point. The stock must have excellent fundamentals. And you should exit the trade if the stock falls 7% to 8% from your purchase price.

**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), which runs a social networking website for professionals, was added to [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) in late December of 2012. The stock cleared a 117.42 buy point from a cup-with-handle base Jan. 10, but didn't move much after that **(1)**.

However, after the close Feb. 7, the company posted fourth-quarter earnings of 35 cents a share, up 192% from a year ago. It trounced views of 19 cents a share. It also marked a second straight quarter of triple-digit growth.

The stock gapped 13% higher at the open the next day and surged 21% for the session. LinkedIn bolted nearly 73% by early May before consolidating gains **(2)**.

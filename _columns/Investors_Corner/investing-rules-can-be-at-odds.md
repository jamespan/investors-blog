  What Should Investors Do When Two Rules Are At Odds?

Sometimes two rules can be at war.

Take the case of yoga apparel retailer **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).

In the first half of 2011, the stock broke out three times. In February, it broke out for a 14% gain before consolidating, and in late March for a 20% pop before correcting.

The third breakout came June 1. In less than three weeks the stock was 20% past the split-adjusted 51.51 buy point 2 .

Here's where the first rule — the eight-week-hold rule — kicked in.

A stock that advances 20% past a valid buy point in two or three weeks should be held for eight weeks and then re-evaluated.

Research shows that truly big gainers often make that first 20% gain quickly after a breakout. The last thing an investor wants to do is exit such a stock too early.

But what if during the eight weeks the stock starts acting like your wild-eyed uncle, the one with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a pistol in the other hand?

That's what happened to Lulu. It started staggering wide and loose, firing off gains one day and spilling the profits the next day.

Halfway into the eight weeks, Lululemon was 25% past the buy point. But upside volume had faded, which was not good 3.

Then the staggering began. Lululemon sashayed over and under its short-term, 10-day line as if it were flunking a sobriety test 4.

On Aug. 2, the stock stumbled 5% 5. Volume was below average but the highest in 10 days. Action also had turned wider and looser than that of the ascent.

A second rule came into play: Don't let a respectable gain round-trip into a losing position.

Two rules were at war. One said hold, the other, avoid a loss.

Loss prevention took precedence. Why? Three reasons: First, the threat of cycling to red was the emerging reality. Second, you can buy a stock back if you are wrong to sell, but you can't always sell at a profit if you're wrong to hold. Third, in late July, the market tipped into a correction.

Investors may differ on where to draw the line when selling to avoid cycling into a loss. If you sold Aug. 2, you accepted a 15% gain.

Many investors would've given Lululemon more leeway. On Aug. 4, it dived 7%. At 55.99, the stock was now 8.7% above the buy point: time to lock in a small gain.

Lululemon cycled to a loss on Aug. 8 6. By Oct. 4, it had fallen 18% from the 51.51 entry point.

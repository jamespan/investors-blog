Investing the IBD way is relatively easy to do well during a market uptrend, when many leading stocks break out of well-formed bases and march to new highs.

But the going gets more difficult for investors when the market turns choppy. In such cases, it's best to be cautious.

Checking the Market Pulse box accompanying the [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) each day keeps you abreast of the market's status.

In choppy markets, the Market Pulse will oscillate. From March 3 to April 29 this year, the market gyrated from "Confirmed Uptrend" to "Market Under Pressure" to "Market In Correction" and back to "Uptrend Resumes."

Such frequent changes in the market's status can be frustrating to readers. But it's a signal to be cautious, as choppy markets don't go in one direction for long (see the accompanying chart).

Big profits can still be had in volatile markets, but the challenge is far greater. That's why investors should buy only those stocks with top-notch fundamentals that break out of sound bases in heavy volume.

In uptrending markets, you might consider taking profits after a 20% to 25% gain in most stocks, while always holding losses at 7%-8%. But when the market turns choppy, you should take profits after a 10% to 15% gain while limiting losses to 3% to 5%.

Purchase amounts should also be smaller in choppy markets to reduce risk. Ultimately, investors should continue to aim for a 3-to-1 profit-loss ratio.

Investors should cast a wary eye at stocks they bought earlier in a market uptrend. They should look for signals of breaking down. For example, a downward-sloping Relative Strength line indicates that the stock is weakening vis-a-vis the overall market. A breach of the 50-day moving average could be a sell signal, especially if it occurs in heavy volume.

On the other hand, a stock that isn't making much progress isn't necessarily breaking down, especially if the Relative Strength line is rising. Tight action could indicate that the stock is forming a new base or a three-weeks-tight pattern.

In all markets, it's best to be flexible and let the market guide your investment decisions. Rallies in which the major averages rise in strong volume and retreat in weak volume have good potential. Those showing the opposite action should be treated with caution. In a correction, cash is king.

Just because the previous uptrend was strong doesn't mean the current uptrend will lead to a big advance. Similarly, a weak prior uptrend doesn't mean the current rally will be subpar.

Furthermore, if you sell a stock after it falls 3% below its buy point in a choppy market, you can always buy it back later when the uptrend resumes. Just make sure the stock retakes its buy point in heavy volume and the market is rebounding.

When you climb a mountain, you tend to take smaller, more careful steps as the elevation increases.


Makes sense, right? As the ascent steepens, so does the risk of falling.


This logic certainly benefits both you and your portfolio when you're scaling into a great stock.


The key to making big money in stocks is to concentrate, over time, more of your money into your best performers.


Mathematically, this makes a lot of sense. If a third of your account is in a stock that is poised to double in price, and the other two-thirds are in duds, you can bolster your overall return by jettisoning the laggards and buying more shares in your emerging big winner.


Just make sure to do this carefully. In the Jan. 24 IBD, this column showed how to pyramid into a full position at the breakout.


The same strategy applies when you're up 10%, 20% or more on the initial position and the stock approaches a follow-on buy point. By adding smaller amounts of shares, you avoid a dramatic rise in the average cost of your shares.


Why do so? A quick correction could send your entire stake underwater and shake your confidence.


When you add shares as the stock finds support at the 10-week moving average, consider buying just a quarter's worth of your initial position, or even less.


Did a three-weeks-tight pattern form? When the stock clears this entry point, perhaps adding just a tenth of the number of shares you already own or less makes sense.


If the stock stumbles soon after your follow-on buy, you need not blow out the entire position. Consider selling just the most recent stake and keep your core holding.


Suppose you grabbed 100 shares of **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) just as it moved past a 558.68 base-on-base buy point on Sept. 21, 2007 **1**. When it hit 670 five weeks later, you could have exited the Internet search leader with a 20% gain **2**.


What would have happened if you instead added to your stake?


In November, Google pulled back to the 10-week line in unusually heavy volume **3**. Say you added 30 shares at 680. Your average cost would have risen to 586.68, or nearly 15% below that price.


That's a decent, but not great, profit cushion. As the bull market lost steam at the end of 2007 and Google began rolling over in January in accelerating volume **4**, you could have sold as late as the week ended Jan. 18 and salvaged a gain.


If you bought 100 shares at 680, your overall profit cushion would have shrunk to just 9% below the latest price.


The risk of losing money jumped quickly if you had tripled your stake with 200 more shares. Your average cost: 639.56 a share. That's more than 14% above the original buy point. By the week ended Jan. 4, 2008 **5**, your total gain would have shrunk to a measly 3%.

Here's the secret to making money with international stocks: Forget that they're international stocks.

In other words, apply the same rules as you would with domestic names. That's what IBD does in its daily [International Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/international-leaders.htm) section.

International Leaders mainly showcases the best-rated stocks in IBD's database of companies that are based abroad. So don't be surprised if you see a company that also does a lot of business in the U.S.

**Global And Local**

Take **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)), the hot luxury apparel maker and operator of 352 retail stores. The company is incorporated in Hong Kong. Yet North America made up 84% of its September-quarter revenue while Europe made up nearly the rest.

No matter that the company operates in, say, China, where language, customs, laws and taxes are completely alien to U.S. investors. Regular column readers are familiar with such current Chinese leaders as web portal **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), search engine **Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)), flash-sale online retailer **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)), social networker **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) and real estate listings website **SouFun** ([SFUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFUN)).

And yes, you'd know all about software developer **NQ Mobile** ([NQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NQ)) as well. Maybe too well.

From Israel, you would have gotten to know **Perion Networks** ([PERI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PERI)), a developer of software that customizes email products. Spain's **Grifols** ([GRFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRFS)) makes blood-related products. And what of **Chicago Bridge And Iron** ([CBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBI))? Did you know it's not based in Chicago, or that it has precious little to do with bridges or iron?

Not all stocks featured in this column go on to become superb winners. Perion currently has a 69 Composite Rating and is sinking further below its 200-day moving average.

International Leaders isn't limited to foreign stocks listed in the U.S. Reporters screen for the best stocks on foreign bourses, while limiting the search to the best stocks on exchanges that U.S. investors will have access to. So Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Canada are in. Only registered foreign institutional investors can access India.

International Leaders goes beyond individual stocks. The Daily World Map portrays returns of benchmark ETFs from each of 16 major markets (China has two, one big-cap, one small-cap), both for that day and for year-to-date.

Economics also raises its ugly head from time to time. Read the column to stay abreast of the crisis in the EU, growth in China and unrest in Brazil. Follow the links of how an event in Brussels or Boston can impact Berlin or Beijing. The world is connected as never before, and that's not always a good thing.

Look, too, at the Top World Stocks, a computer-generated daily table of 10 great names (fewer in lean times) that meet IBD's stringent standards for fundamentals and stock strength.

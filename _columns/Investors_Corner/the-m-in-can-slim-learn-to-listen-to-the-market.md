One golden rule of smart investing is to listen to and trade with the market's direction.

It's easy advice to give.

But even when you put your ear to the ground, understanding just what the market is saying is among the toughest skill sets for investors to master.

IBD's The Big Picture and Market Pulse provide a good starting point on the market's course. But the more serious you are about investing, the more signs you should check to gauge market behavior.

One long-standing tool is the Advisors Sentiment Survey, published by Chartcraft Inc. under the Investors Intelligence name.

The weekly survey, developed by Chartcraft founder Abe Cohen in 1963, polls more than 100 market newsletters. It categorizes the authors' sentiment as bullish, bearish or long-term bearish/expecting a correction.

Like many sentiment indicators, the survey doesn't act the way you might think.

When the number of bullish advisers rises sharply relative to the number of bearish advisers, it suggests the market is at risk of a downturn. When too many analysts pile on the bears' barge, an ailing market may be about to turn higher.

That makes it a contrarian indicator. In other words, when it registers elevated levels of euphoria or pessimism, chances are the market will head the opposite way.

Other contrarian gauges include the NYSE short interest ratio (which measures the amount of stocks being shorted) and the put vs. call volume ratio (which compares the volume in bearish put options vs. bullish call options).

All of these contrarian indicators appear at the bottom of IBD's How's The Market page.

The two-line Bulls vs. Bears chart graphs the results of the Advisors Sentiment Survey. When the spread of bulls to bears is 35 to 40 points, some consider that dangerous. When the market is in a correction, watch for the lines to cross: When the bears' line climbs above the bulls', the market may be about to turn.

Keep in mind, sentiment indicators are secondary and no match for using the price and volume action of the major indexes.

Still, the bulls-bears survey can help put you on notice, keeping you wary ahead of a downturn, and urge you to have your watch list updated and ready to sprint by the time a follow-through confirms a fresh market rally.

The indicator did its job in August, when the bears' line climbed above the bulls' just ahead of the Sept. 1 market follow-through **1**.

The survey has been showing elevated bullish sentiment, with bulls about 30 points above bears. That suggests a frothy market, yet the reading has been high even as the market continued rallying.

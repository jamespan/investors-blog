Time is hard to come by these days. For many investors, that's probably not going to change.

It's hard enough to find time to research stocks and analyze underlying market health. Screens like Your Weekly Review, IBD 50, Stock Spotlight and IPO Leaders serve up plenty of compelling names, but allocating time to truly understand a company's story — as well as its fundamental and technical health — isn't easy.

[Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), launched in July 2011, is designed to help the busy investor.

The Leaders List presents high-quality names that are at or near buy points. Each name comes with extensive chart annotations (updated twice a day) that analyze price and volume trends. A back story delves into the company's business and key news.

The size of the Leaders List depends on overall market health. When the market is rising and serving up plenty of base breakouts, the list will be chock-full of names. But when institutional selling crops up in the indexes, the list generally gets smaller.

Index traders can benefit from Leaderboard's [ETF Strategy](http://leaderboard.investors.com/thebigpicture/ibdetfmarketstrategy.aspx) update, which uses IBD's Market Pulse timing mechanism to make the most of market uptrends.

**Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) debuted on the Leaders List in October 2012. After gapping out of a cup-with-handle pattern, the stock soon tested its 10-week moving average **(1)** but kept moving higher. It was sent to the Cut List when a wave of institutional selling hit the stock during the week ended April 5, 2013 **(2)**. It ultimately found support again at its 10-week moving average, but taking profits when a wave of heavy-volume selling hits a stock is always sound strategy.

You'll often find stocks with deteriorating fundamentals in the Cut List. In some cases, short-sale opportunities can arise.

When a Leaders List stock falls 7%-8% below a proper buy point, it moves to the Cut List. Or it may move when a profit-taking rule is triggered, such as a 20%-to-25% rally past a buy point.

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) was added to the Cut List on March 14 as it was breaking down from a late-stage base. At the time, it was trading around 162. Over the next three weeks, Baidu lost 13%. It's rallied back a bit but is still finding resistance at its 50-day moving average.

Leaderboard also includes access to a daily update of the IBD 50 and annotated charts of the top 10 ranked stocks. You can learn more at www.investors.com/leaderboard.

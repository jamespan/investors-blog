You've studied up on the [CAN SLIM acronym](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), and you know what you are looking for in a leading growth stock. The next questions: How and where to find it?


Investors face a jungle-dense world of online research offerings: Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, CNBC and Bloomberg, to name a few. All offer an impressive slate of research. But none of them truly know CAN SLIM.


Instead, use IBD's powerful [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) tool, backed by the extensive research resources of William O'Neil + Co.'s proprietary stock database. It is built entirely around identifying and vetting CAN SLIM stocks.


To find it, simply type a stock ticker into the search window on the investors.com home page. (The box is marked with a magnifying glass icon and "Enter Symbol/Keyword.")


The search takes you to the Stock Quote, a page packed with an array of information about your stock. It also includes, to the lower left of the stock chart, a Composite Rating box, next to which is a link that says, "Get A Stock Checkup." (*You can also find [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) by pointing to "Research" in the main navigation bar on the Investors.com homepage*.)


Follow that link to dive immediately into CAN SLIM research.


**The C**: For current quarterly earnings and sales, start with a look at the stock's EPS Rating within its group. A high ranking is a good gauge of fundamental strength, particularly in a strong group.


Drop down to the Fundamental Performance table, and you will find EPS growth in the most recent quarter as well as the average increase over the past three quarters and the number of quarters of EPS acceleration. The colored dots to the right of those numbers tell you whether the growth rate is strong (green), middling (yellow) or weak (red).


**The A**: One heading lower is annual earnings. It gives three-year EPS growth, consecutive years of EPS increases and the EPS estimate for the current year. Seek increases of 25% or greater.


**The N**: To see if the stock is making new highs from valid bases, drop to the bottom of the page.


The page provides a chart that will give a sense of where the stock is in technical terms. Below the chart, a list of recent IBD articles offer perspectives on the company in terms of new products, new management or a change in operations.


**The S & I**: Readings on supply and demand of shares as well as institutional support are combined under the Technical Performance header. It provides an Accumulation/Distribution Rating that suggests to what degree institutions appear to be building or exiting positions in the stock.


The Up/Down Volume gauge gives another angle on the buying-vs.-selling picture. A ratio of higher than 1.0 is positive. Also check the increase or decrease in total funds owning the stock, as well as the number of quarters of increasing fund ownership.



For instance, let's look  **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)). The Chinese internet and social media play holds an excellent score for RS (96), a top-notch Composite Rating of 99, and excellent earnings increases in recent quarters. Earnings per share jumped 159% vs. the year-ago quarter. Plus, Sina beat the consensus EPS estimate by an impressive 22.8%. No wonder you'll see a green dot next to this figure in the Fundamental Performance section of Sina's [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-sina-corporation-sina.aspx).


But its up/down volume ratio of 0.7 is less than ideal. Notice how the Stock Checkup gives Sina a yellow dot for this factor, which is neutral. It justifies the need to do a little more research, including a study of the chart action and the quality of the current base.


Sina broke out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) with a 95.59 buy point in late July. The price action has been choppy. However, gains in recent days and a strong reversal on Aug. 9 have taken place in big turnover — a clue that some funds are actively buying shares.


**The L**: Leader or laggard? The quick, easy gauges here are the bar gauges at the top of the page: EPS Rating; Relative Price Strength Rating; Sales + Margin + Return On Equity (SMR) Rating; and Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Each rates the stock vs. the overall market, as well as other stocks in its group.


**The M**: Last and easiest to monitor is market direction. The first header, General Market, gives the market's status and a green, yellow or red dot. A yellow dot is like a yellow traffic signal: Proceed with caution.


You can read more about the market via the [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) each day (find it at "Market Trend" on the home page) and in the IBD Weekly print edition, in the B section.

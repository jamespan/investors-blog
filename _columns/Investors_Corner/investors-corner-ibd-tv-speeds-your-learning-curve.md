**_Screening For Winners: First In A Series_**

Sometimes, using your eyes is the best way to learn.

Investors.com offers a menu of market-related videos that will inform and hopefully enrich you.

If you're a serious CAN SLIM investor, you should already have read the best-selling "How To Make Money In Stocks" by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil. Also essential is reading IBD each day, in particular its stock market coverage, and using its research resources.

But [IBD TV](https://www.investors.com/MediaCenter/default.aspx) at Investors.com can really help you with a step-by-step analysis of the market's action and show you one or two stocks that may be near or at a buy point.

Why is one market decline more important than another? Why is one cup-with-handle base so attractive, but another isn't?

Don't be offended by a little hand-holding. This is a great way to learn how to look at the market and at individual stocks through CAN SLIM eyes.

Even if you're an experienced trader, the videos offered daily at IBD's website can serve as a refresher course, or may offer some ideas that you hadn't considered.

To access the videos on the Investors.com home page, go to the primary navigation bar and click on IBD TV. You'll see a menu of videos.

Click on the latest Market Wrap video, and you'll get IBD's perspective on the day's broad market action.

Like The Big Picture column, it will make sense of the daily price-and-volume action of the major indexes, and will perhaps delve into one stock, or industry, that may be doing something interesting.

The Market Wrap on May 4, for instance, noted the market had entered a correction. A confluence of factors — including a congestion of distribution days among the major indexes, as well as dreadful performances by recent breakouts — pointed to a weak market. Under the "Recent Videos" column you'll find the prior session's Market Wrap as well as the current Daily Stock Analysis .

Do you shy away from charts? If so, try out this resource.

In just a few minutes, you'll get a scrutiny of a top-rated stock's fundamentals and chart action. At first it may be all new to you. Watch a video a couple of times. After a while, you'll see exactly what you're supposed to see.

Now scroll down the page a bit. Once Investors.com runs a Daily Stock Analysis, it leaves it up for your convenience. That's the archive you're looking at.

On the left, check out the Browse menu selection. You can tap into Bill O'Neil's Interviews, Education (which is a series of 20 Rules For Investment Success) and IBD 2-Minute Tips.

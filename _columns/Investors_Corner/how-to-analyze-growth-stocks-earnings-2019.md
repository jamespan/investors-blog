  How To Analyze Growth Stocks: Will This Earnings Measure Cool In 2019?

Long-term success with the [Investor's Business Daily investing system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/getting-started/) means being committed to finding growth stocks that have three critical elements: superior fundamentals, excellent relative price strength, and increasing ownership by mutual funds and other professional investors.




Return on equity, or ROE, plays a pivotal role in understanding the fundamentals side of the equation. But make sure you don't use it alone when picking stocks for your portfolio.


Think of ROE as a unique measure of profitability. It's simply a company's yearly net income divided by shareholders equity. Multiply the ratio by 100 to get a percentage figure. IBD calculates ROE by taking the average shareholders equity over the past two years, not simply the most recent year.


IBD founder Bill O'Neil, in creating the [CAN SLIM seven-point paradigm](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) of growth stock picking, has long advocated focusing on those companies with an ROE of at least 17%. What if that number is low? He often looked at annual pretax profit margin. If that figure was sharply rising in recent years and the best within the industry, then it could substitute for a poor ROE figure.


Lately, though, high ROE is not a rarity.


 


At the start of January this year, the [IBD 50 list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of growth stocks posted an average ROE of 29%. This robust statistic reflects years of outstanding earnings gains amid a growing U.S. economy.


Three of the stocks in the IBD 50 back then — **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), **Innoviva** ([INVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVA)) and **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) — do not have an ROE since they show a net deficit on the balance sheet.


Of course, you could check a company's pretax margin and ROE by hitting the financial reports. Or you can save time with the SMR Rating, found in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), in stock quotes on Investors.com, or the stock research tables of IBD Weekly.


"SMR" stands for Sales, Margins and Return on equity. Focus on those stocks with an A, B or C grade. The mini charts in the [IBD 50 pages](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of IBD Weekly show the actual ROE.


What Is Apple's ROE Lately?
---------------------------



**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) shows that a stock can signal a major peak in price even when ROE looks fantastic. In fact, from FY 2010 to FY 2018, the iPhone marketer boasts a stunning average ROE of 39%. ROE, though, is not a forward looking measure.


Also, a company may show a mild return on equity yet still emerge as a big market winner. Why?


Institutions may see an improving picture for that company's profitability and growth. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), a former huge market winner, boasts an ROE of 43% in fiscal 2018). Yet when it broke out of a [solid double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) with a 72.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in the week ended May 30, 2014, ROE in the latest fiscal year was much weaker at 7%.



However, earnings and sales were growing at an ultrafast clip.



Palo Alto's industry group mate **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) showed a relatively "weak" ROE of 12.9% in 2017. But the average over the past six years is 17.9%.


In the first half of 2019, the small cap proved to be a true market leader in the software sector.

Every serious football player knows whether it's the first quarter or, say, the third quarter.

It's harder to win if you're wrong about where you are in the game.

The same holds true in investing. If you don't know where you stand in a market rally, making smart decisions is trickier.

You should always ask yourself about the stage of the game. Is it the early days of a new bull market? Or is it year three since stocks bottomed and started to run up?

As you probably already know, the answer right now to that first question is "No." The answer to that second question is "Yes."

IBD has long emphasized this research-based fact: The big money is generally made in the first year or two of a bull market cycle.

W. Scott O'Neil reiterated this point in a recent interview.

"In year three — which is really the third or fourth quarter of the ballgame — that's when you can have givebacks, and at best, it's usually kind of back and forth, choppy," said O'Neil, a frequent speaker at IBD seminars, a portfolio manager and the president of MarketSmith, a sister company to IBD.

"If you're trying to make up lost ground, you're late."

**Laggards Give Key Clues**

O'Neil said an experience in 1995 helped him appreciate the importance of knowing what stage of the game you're in. The first three quarters of 1995 were great for stocks, especially for semiconductor names. But the rally ended up fizzling out at the beginning of that year's fourth quarter.

Still, late in the game in '95, O'Neil spotted a stock that looked promising.

"I come across this beautiful pattern, and I'm pretty sure it was a cup with handle on a semiconductor stock," he told IBD.

But he said a key problem was this: If it was such a great stock, why was it breaking out late in the game?

"That by definition is a laggard," he said. "So I had a bigger-than-usual giveback because I was overconfident late in the cycle. There's a psychological piece to this also."

O'Neil also noted that a laggard is the first stock that an institution is likely to dump if it starts to get cold feet about the market.

"To sum it up, my personal experience is that you're at risk of givebacks late in the cycle, and we're in year three right now," he said.

"So you've got to ask yourself, what is my risk (vs.) reward in the third quarter vs. what was it in the first and second quarters? That's the key that so many investors forget."

IBD offers ways to help figure out where you are in the investing game. For starters, The Big Picture column often discusses where we stand in the current market trend.

Features like the IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and the IBD Big Cap 20 also explain whether leading stocks are shaping early-stage bases or third- or fourth-stage structures.

When you start to see many leaders working on late-stage patterns, then you know that it's getting to be late in the game.

You also can get hints from how certain industry groups are faring.

Capital goods industries (think machinery or railroad equipment) are typically late movers in a business or stock market cycle. So if they're starting to advance, you're probably near the end of the game.

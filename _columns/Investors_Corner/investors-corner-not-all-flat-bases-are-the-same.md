Not all pancakes are the same — particularly if you are a self-described breakfast lover.

If you like the ones filled with blueberries or apples, then your feelings might be hurt if you're served a flapjack that contains just one berry or a single sliver of fruit.

It's important to be just as discriminating with base patterns. Just because a stock has formed the basic framework of a specific pattern does not mean the stock is destined for a great move.

This fact applies to cup-type bases, double bottoms, high-tight flags, flat bases and others. Today we'll focus on the flat base.

If you've been reading this column for some time, you know the minimum requirements of a flat base. It must be at least five weeks long, usually starting with a down week. The decline from the base's high to low cannot be greater than 15%. In most cases, the correction within the base is around 10% to 15%. Finally, the overall shape of the pattern must be, well, like a pancake.

But even if a stock passes all of these tests, you want to peer more closely inside the base.

Did the stock show a dry-up in volume within the base, especially in the down weeks in price? Were there any positive reversals in the base? Are there gap-downs in the base? Even a shallow base can exhibit volatile action.

Form a habit of asking yourself these questions as you examine a flat base, especially on a weekly chart. Because of the price scaling, patterns often look different on a weekly chart vs. a daily.

**Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) is on track to post its highest profits ever this year — \$2.49 a share, up 20%, according to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. Its ESPN sports franchise is world-class, and the company has ambitious resort plans that include a new theme park in Shanghai.

So why did its 10-week flat base, formed earlier this year, turn out like burnt toast?

The week ended March 18 showed a 4% decline in heavy, accelerating volume **1**. You'd prefer to see high turnover on a weekly advance. Disney rebounded the next week and regained its 10-week moving average, but volume fell **2**. The stock never broke out.

Investor's Corner just completed a set of nine columns on chart patterns that help dedicated growth investors make money.


These key patterns range from the [cup with handle](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/660966-psychology-behind-cup-with-handle-base.htm)) to the [rare high, tight flag](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/662056-uncommon-pattern-can-produce-solid-gains.htm) 


Knowing how to exploit these patterns of investor behavior is empowering. But don't forget to tread cautiously.


Not every cup with handle will work. A cup will fail if the market is in terrible shape. In other cases, the cup itself will have a flaw.


If you buy a new digital TV that has defects, no worries. Just take it back to the store or return it for a refund. The stock market does not have such a customer-friendly policy.


It pays to understand the major traits of a poor base structure. When you've identified one or two such shortcomings in a stock, don't buy it. Find better merchandise.


Let's say you are spying a stock that has gone on a long run and is trying to achieve one more breakout hurrah. If a stock spends at least eight or nine weeks in a row beneath its 10-week moving average, it may lack the strength to build a sound base.


A stock that is "living" underneath the 10-week line is probably trading well below its 52-week or all-time highs. This implies that demand is slack.


In contrast, a great stock will spend a lot of time in the upper half of the base's price range. Healthy share demand allows it to trade at a high price. Before the breakout, it's usually trading above its 10-week line and finding support amid brief pullbacks.


**Monsanto** ([MON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MON)) scored a marvelous bull run in the mid- to late 2000s. But after topping in June 2008, the stock slid downhill.


The seeds giant dropped 56% from a high of 145.80 to a low of 63.47 in November 2008. Then it began a long bottoming process. Problem was, it stayed near the bottom of its base for far too long.


Volume soared in the week ended Oct. 30, 2009, **(1)** as Monsanto finished an eighth straight week below the 10-week moving average.


Three weeks later, the stock reclaimed its 10-week line and built a downward-sloped handle. **(2)** Volume dried up nicely. But Monsanto still lay 42% below its 145.80 peak.


The breakout lasted one week, and Monsanto sank. It dropped 48% below the 85.10 entry point in less than six months.

Whether you're a novice or experienced investor, everyone makes mistakes from time to time.


It's easy to get discouraged if your losses pile up faster than your wins. But contrary to conventional wisdom, it's possible to still achieve outstanding gains.


How, you might ask?


"The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you're wrong," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in hisÂ [investment classic](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splash.aspx?id=htmmis) "How to Make Money In Stocks."


Cutting losses short and locking in gains is key to investing success. Follow O'Neil's approach by using a 3-to-1 win-to-loss ratio by taking profits when you're up 20% to 25% in winners and cutting losses when you're down 7% to 8% from your purchase price. Do this, and you can often stay ahead.

Let's say you've invested \$25,000 in each of the four stocks in your portfolio, with one of those being **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)).


The stock initially faltered after clearing a 83.53 buy point Feb. 4. It re-crossed the entry Feb. 16 in above-average volume **(1)**. After rising as much as 8%, the stock gapped up and soared 17% April 4, past a 90.03 buy point. It's now trading more than 30% past the 83.53 entry. Investors could lock in some gains here, if they haven't already. But those with supreme conviction could let the stock ride a bit further.


A \$25,000 investment in Edwards at the earlier buy point would be worth \$32,500, a \$7,250 gain. That could offset three other \$25,000 positions sold for a 7% loss each, totaling losses of \$5,250. And if you can cut losses more quickly, even better. While the 7%-8% loss-cutting discipline is a good rule of thumb, it can be prudent to cut losses at 3% to 5% or even less, depending on how the broader market is acting. When the market is in correction or under pressure, more stocks are likely to fall then rise.


So if you're seeing a lot of red flags, using the smaller numbers makes sense. But even when the market is rallying, you should never take more than an 8% loss.


After studying stocks for years, O'Neil found that most leading stocks tend to advance 20% to 25% from a base breakout before pausing to correct or consolidate. This is why it's good to take profits in most stocks at 20%-25%. He also found that the best institutional-quality stocks rarely fall 8% from a proper buy point in a sound chart pattern.


"If a speculator is correct half of the time, he is hitting a good average," famed Wall Street trader Bernard Baruch has said. "Even being right three or four times out of 10 should yield a person a fortune if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly on the ventures where he has been wrong."

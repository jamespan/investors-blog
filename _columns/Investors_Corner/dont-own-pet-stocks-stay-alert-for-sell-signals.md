Your pets should be treated with love and kindness. Your stocks, even the best ones, should not.

Both take a lot of time and can cost you a lot of money. Both can bring you joy, cause you pain, and both need to be watched carefully. But only one is okay to get emotionally attached to.

Hint —it's not the ones housed at a brokerage account.

It's great to have winning stocks in your portfolio. You did your homework, stalked the base and pounced as the stock broke out in heavy trading. You added shares correctly and are now up 50% or more in a matter of weeks or months.

But getting too emotionally attached to stocks in your portfolio can cloud your judgment and cause you to make irrational decisions. Yes, it's easy to get attached to a stock that has been good to you. You might feel that the stock can do no wrong even though the technicals are telling you otherwise.

You must not lose sight of your objectivity. Otherwise, you could go from cheers to jeers in a short period of time. Stocks are not your friends, and they don't exist to please you. They are investments that you devote your hard-earned money to and take a chance on.

Always remember to let a sound set of trading rules dictate your trading decisions, not what you think or how you feel.

If the stock tumbles 10% in the highest volume ever, or if it takes out its 50-day moving average in heavy trade after the company slashed its sales outlook, don't just dismiss this as a small step backward — it's usually a sell signal. And if after a long, stellar run, the stock goes into a climax run, don't wait until shares fall 50% from their high before taking action.

Also, don't rationalize that it's a great firm with a great product. Stocks can take a beating simply due to overall market weakness.

**Hansen Natural** ([HANS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HANS)) had a gigantic run that started in early 2004. The Corona, Calif.-based beverage firm had a hot product. Its Monster energy drinks, introduced in 2002, gave a boost to people's hectic lives. At one point, sales from its Monster drinks line accounted for half of annual sales.

The stock initially broke out in early 2004, tripled by late June, then settled into another base. Hansen broke out again in November and again more than tripled by July 2005.

In 2006, Hansen started showing some signs of climax action. On May 9 and 10, the stock had two exhaustion gaps **1** ([Click here](/NewsAndAnalysis/PhotoPopup.aspx?path=Web2c030111.gif&docId=564410) for daily chart). It was also more than 100% above its 200-day moving average. Also, the price spread for that week was the biggest since the initial breakout.

Those who sang the company's praises and ignored these warning signs would have seen the stock plunge 50% by September **2**.

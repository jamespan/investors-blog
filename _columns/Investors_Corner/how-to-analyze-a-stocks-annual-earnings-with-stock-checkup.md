The subscriber-only Stock Checkup tool at Investors.com is one of the premier validation tools available to investors. Why? You can quickly see if the stock passes muster from a fundamental and technical perspective.


The "A" in the CAN SLIM acronym stands for "annual earnings." While strong quarterly earnings growth is good to see when evaluating a stock, a steady track record of annual earnings growth is also important.


It’s easy to get a handle on a stock’s annual earnings with [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). Scroll down a bit to the Fundamental Performance area. In the Annual Earnings area, a company’s three-year EPS growth rate is shown. Curious how many consecutive years of annual earnings growth a company has? You’ll find that here too. Finally, the annual earnings estimate for the company’s current fiscal year is shown.


A green dot next to the number means the company passes muster. A yellow dot is neutral, and a red dot is a fail.


A general rule of thumb is to look for firms with an annual earnings growth rates of 20%. In a study between 1980 and 2000, the median annual growth rate of all outstanding stocks at their early emerging stage was 36%.

In the large-cap space, several top-rated names in IBD’s database will have sub-20% growth rates, but don’t automatically dismiss them if they pass muster in all other fundamental areas. An annual earnings growth rate of 10%-15%, for example, is quite respectable for a large cap.


When it comes to consecutive years of annual earnings growth, look for firms showing at least two to three years of growth. IBD 50 name **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) shows eight straight years of annual earnings growth stretching back to 2007. The same goes for **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)).


When it comes to a company’s annual earnings estimate for the current fiscal year, 20% is a very good benchmark for a high-growth name. You may accept a smaller growth rate for mature large-cap companies.


SmartSelect Ratings are shown at the top of Stock Checkup. Annual earnings are factored into the calculation for the Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Sales+Profit Margins+Return on Equity (SMR) ratings.


In the EPS Rating, a company’s annual earnings are looked at alongside recent quarterly profits. In the SMR Rating, return on equity helps separate well-managed firms from poorly managed ones. It is derived by dividing annual net income by average shareholders' equity over the past two years.

Your watch list is bursting with 30, 40, even 50 names. None of them have weak IBD ratings.


How do you whittle that down to a much more manageable list?


Here are a few suggestions. Most are mechanical steps. They might help you identify the true diamonds within the bunch.


• **Ask: How many bases?**


Prefer those stocks that have built early-stage bases. Of course, a few exceptional stocks may still cruise higher after forming third- or fourth-stage bases. Yet in most cases, even if a member of your watch list is in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?start=ibd), you may want to skip it if it's already quadrupled in price and has just formed a fourth-stage cup.


Remember: After a stock has broken out, it must rise 20% or more from the proper buy point before a new base can be counted. Base-on-base patterns count as one base.


• **Ask: Is it truly the No. 1 company in its field?**


Divide the stocks on your watch list by broad sector or even industry group. Do you have half a dozen apparel retail stocks? Or four or five software firms? If yes, you need to prune.


Compare head to head via EPS Rating, SMR and Accumulation-Distribution Rating. Use IBD Stock Checkup. Highlight the ones with sharply accelerating quarterly growth; they may be your best candidates.


• **What's the average volume?**


Once in a while, a few fantastic stocks begin their big runs while trading fewer than 400,000 shares a day. But in general, you want to see high liquidity at the breakout. When **Infosys** ([INFY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INFY)) broke out of a base in July 2009, it traded 2.7 million shares a day on average. Higher average share volume can also mean lower volatility and more sleep at night.


• **What is the share float?**


The float, seen in the second line of every IBD mini chart, can be thinner than 30 million shares (think **Panera** ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) or as bloated as 5 billion (think **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)). When all things are equal, favor the stock with the smaller float. The firm has likely never split its shares, or done so minimally. (See the [March 7](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/603350-do-not-shrug-off-a-split.htm) and [May 31](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/613078-stock-splits-can-signal-a-peak-in-share-prices.htm) Corner columns for more on this topic.)


• **When was its IPO?**


Preferred is 1997 or later. Some turnarounds can be great stock plays, even after being in the market for decades or more.


• **Study the stock charts well.**


Seek evidence of heavy buying on a daily chart. Look at price-volume action on a week-to-week basis. Dump those names with too many wild swings (say, 10% from high to low or more) and those with too many big down weeks in price in big volume.


• **Take the 20,000-foot view.**


Does a stock have the product and customer-base potential to be the next **Amgen**, ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) or **Home Depot**? ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) If yes, it stays on your list.

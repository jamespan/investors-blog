  Memo To Investors: Avoid Tailoring Time-Tested Rules

Rules are meant to keep you out of trouble — not only in life but in the stock market as well.


Rules help keep the emotion out of investing. The more you can do that, the better off you'll be. Letting emotion guide your decisions is a serious mistake in the stock market, as it can result in poorly timed buys and sells.


IBD's rule-based [system](http://education.investors.com/) for buying and selling growth stocks has stood the test of time. Decades and decades of market research repeatedly showed that winning stocks looked a lot alike ahead of big price moves.


It's human nature to bend the rules at times — mixing CAN SLIM with other systems — but tailoring rules to your own tastes leads to subpar results. Learning to follow IBD rules strictly will ultimately help you become a better investor.


Simply put, IBD's growth-stock methodology says to buy fundamentally and technically healthy growth stocks during market uptrends. Sounds easy enough, but plenty of mistakes can be made along the way. Here are a few:


**Ignoring underlying market health**. Most stocks follow the market's general trend. You can buy a stock with a new product and service that's fueling big earnings and sales growth but it won't mean much if major averages are in a distribution phase and institutions are selling hard. That's a tough tide to swim against.


**Buying too early**. Another common mistake is buying a growth stock too early in anticipation of a price breakout from a good base. Growth stocks with top fundamentals always digest gains after a run-up and build new bases. Buying during a heavy-volume breakout — when institutional investors are in there buying as well — puts the odds more in your favor. Don't buy before a base completes.


**Bullish chart, shaky fundamentals**. Sometimes, a cup-with-handle pattern or flat base looks so good, it's tough to ignore. But there are countless examples in the market every day of stocks in great technical setups with lukewarm fundamentals. Demand strong earnings and sales growth in recent quarters, peak profit margin and high return on equity. A bullish chart is only half of it.


**Not cutting losses.** Refusing to cut losses when they're manageable is one of the toughest things to do. It means admitting failure and most investors don't like to do it. Cutting losses at 7% to 8% below your purchase price will shield you from a devastating loss.


**Weak industry group**. Identifying leading stocks in leading industry groups is always the goal. Watch the IBD Industry Groups [table](https://www.investors.com/pdf/IBD197_011614.pdf) regularly, today on Page B2. There's no shortage of leading stocks in lagging groups. Always look for strong breadth of leadership in a group.


**Low-quality sponsorship**. Buy stocks that mutual fund managers and other institutions are buying. It's their buying power that really fuels a stock's rise.

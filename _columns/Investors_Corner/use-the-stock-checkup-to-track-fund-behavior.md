**Make Money With IBD Stock Checkup:** [Seventh In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/618220/201207251420/make-money-with-ibd-stock-checkup.aspx)

  

A silly old kids' joke asks: How do you know you've had elephants in your refrigerator? Answer: footprints in the pizza.

  

The stock market's elephants are institutional investors: mutual funds, hedge funds, trusts and other traders with capacious pockets. These are the I in CAN SLIM. Their influence on the market and on leading stocks is immeasurable.

  

Institutions drive base patterns. Their buying constrains a stock's supply of shares, setting the stage for breakouts and leadership-grade runs. Learning to recognize and track institutional buying and selling — their footprints in the pizza — is critical to success.

  

IBD's Stock Checkup — an analysis tool at Investors.com — offers two vitally helpful gauges.

  

For all their size, institutions tend to leave subtle signs when they move in and out of stocks. Telltales can include spikes in trading, support at specific moving averages and whether a stock closes high or low in a daily or weekly trading range.

  

The Stock Checkup provides a longer-term barometer of fund activity.

  

To find it, type a stock ticker. Let's use **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) as an example.

  

On the Stock Checkup page, scroll down to the Supply And Demand heading, just above the stock chart.

  

Here, you'll see that the number of funds owning shares of Mellanox increased 3% in the most recent quarter. Also, the number of shares held by funds increased for a seventh straight quarter. Both are clear signs of institutional buying.

  

The picture wasn't always so rosy. Mellanox saw its fund ownership drop from 14 million to 11 million shares in the third quarter of 2010. The stock corrected as much as 43% in that quarter.

  

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) shows a zero change over the past quarter in the number of funds holding shares. This rates a red light. Existing funds did increase their buying in the most recent quarter, earning the stock a green dot.

  

**Acme Packet** ([APKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APKT)) saw a 10% drop in its number of fund owners and has no quarters of increasing fund ownership. Both signal serious red lights.

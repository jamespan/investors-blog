If you throw a cup at a large group of stock investors, you'll probably hit at least one person who doesn't like chart patterns — especially if the cup ricochets.

There are a lot of patterns, and some have quirky names. Cups, saucers, cups with handles, flat bases, square boxes, double bottoms and more. So it's hardly surprising to find some skepticism.

The fact is, though, that it pays for growth investors to know about these patterns, which IBD also dubs as bases, consolidations or structures.

It pays because buying on a breakout from a sound base can lead to nice profits of 20%, 50% or more.

This doesn't work every single time, but it does happen regularly, as longtime IBD readers know well.

It might occur within just a few weeks (think tech play **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)), or it might take a couple of years (think steady performer **McCormick & Co.** ([MKC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKC)).

In learning about patterns, it helps to look at the stock charts of past big winners. You'll see how those top performers sketched bases, then broke out and scored big gains.

**Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), for example, cleared a deep cup in August 2010. Another longtime leader, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), topped a deep cup-with-handle pattern in July 2009. And there's discount retailer **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), which jumped out of a long flat base in February 2010 and hasn't looked back so far.

Going way back in stock market history, a railroad play — Richmond & Danville — broke out of a cup-with-handle base in 1885.

As you can see, these various stock patterns occur in any decade, in every decade. Why not learn to recognize them, and then capitalize on them?

At the same time, keep in mind why these structures take shape.

Sometimes, an individual stock just needs to digest its gains.

After the issue's strong advance, big investors have at least temporarily lost interest in buying more shares.

Other times, you'll see a pattern develop when the general market itself is catching its breath, as William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, said in his best-seller "How to Make Money in Stocks."

"It's normal for growth stocks to create cup patterns during intermediate declines in the general market and to correct 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the market averages," O'Neil wrote.

As growth stocks form their bases, some investors are shaken out, while others simply decide it's time to lock in their gains.

Then, when the breakout from the new base happens, new investors get a chance to climb aboard.

Be patient and wait for the breakout. It can take anywhere from several weeks to a year or more for a proper one to develop.

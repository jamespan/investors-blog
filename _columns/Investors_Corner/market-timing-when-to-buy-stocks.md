"Market timing" ranks high among the most polarizing phrases in investing lingo. There are investors who believe in market timing, and investors who do not. While many experts in the field say there's no point in following technical trading rules, IBD takes a different approach.




Investor's Business Daily has argued in favor of market timing ever since IBD's start in April 1984. From decades of market research and experience, one thing is clear: You can and in fact should time the market.


Market timing is not about outsmarting the market or predicting the future. Rather, it's about recognizing the market's day-to-day motion as a powerful force that must be respected.


In many ways, the [M in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/market-direction/) stands for the most important element in the whole investing system: market direction. To be successful at investing, you need to be aware of current market conditions and trade accordingly. Even if you find a stock with the first six [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/market-direction/) traits lined up, it's very hard for a stock to move higher as the overall market pulls lower.

The M In CAN SLIM: Seek A Market Uptrend
----------------------------------------


According to IBD's research, four out of every five stocks follow the market trend — meaning the direction of the major U.S. stock indexes. Therefore, if you buy a stock amid a strong uptrend, you have an 80% chance of being right. But if you buy in a downtrend (or what IBD calls a "market in correction"), you have an 80% chance of being wrong.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ICcondition122319-223x300.jpg)IBD's approach to market timing is underpinned by a few key concepts.


The [follow-through-day concept](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) helps investors identify the start of the next major market uptrend, which is difficult, if not impossible, to do when relying on headlines and news alone.


During a market correction, if a major index closes up from the previous session, this marks the start of an attempted rally. For this attempted rally to stay alive on Day 2 and Day 3, the intraday low of Day 1 cannot be undercut. On Day 4 or later of the attempted rally, if either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 delivers a strong gain in volume up from the previous day, it results in a follow-through day. This new sign of life confirms that institutions may in fact be getting back into stocks. [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) column spots these follow-through days for you.


[Not every follow-through day works](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). Plus, they don't mark the exact day a market bottoms, but they do get very close. But if you go back in history, you'll find a follow-through at every major bottom since 1900. You'll also find that many big stock winners commonly launch their biggest advances around the start of a new market uptrend.


When Not To Buy Stocks: Distribution Days
-----------------------------------------


A [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) serves to identify market tops and the start of institutional selling. Institutional investors are the heavyweights, such as insurance companies and investing firms, who largely set a market's direction.


When a major market index makes a significant decline (at least 0.2%) in heavier volume vs. the prior session, this signals distribution. Four or five serious distribution days over a period of several weeks almost always signals that the market is heading for a downturn.


The easiest way to keep track of distribution days? Read [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) column and its accompanying graphic, the Market Pulse. There, you'll find a tally count on distribution days, but only during a market rally. Once in a correction, it's time to switch focus and instead look for the next [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).

Three Phases of Market Timing
-----------------------------


To sum it up, the market has three possible phases: confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure, and correction.


An uptrend under pressure occurs when professional selling has picked up sharply, but not quite enough to derail the overall rally. So, be cautious with new buys. Keep an eye on current holdings to make sure they're acting well. Top growth stocks are more likely fall harder than the rest of the market. This type of market environment invites subjectivity among investors and lacks clarity in terms of direction. Keep a close watch for any emerging signals that indicate which way the market could be headed next.


A market in correction is the best time to stay on the sidelines, [cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), [lock in gains before they turn into losses](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) and wait for the next uptrend to emerge.

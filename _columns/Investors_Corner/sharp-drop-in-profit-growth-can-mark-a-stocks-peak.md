We demand a lot from the stocks in our portfolio. It's not enough for a company to be simply making money; it also has to be growing its profit and sales at a solid pace.


When a company starts to report sharply slower rates of bottom-line growth, watch out. There are few things uglier than a growth stock with growth problems.


This column, the 18th in a 22-part series on spotting key sell signals, will examine deceleration of a company's sales and earnings growth.


Don't confuse growth deceleration with losing money. Let's say XYZ Corp. earned \$1 per share in Q4. Is that good?


Sure, if that buck compares with 50 cents in the year-earlier quarter. That's EPS growth of 100%. It's even better if the company's most recent four quarters showed profit gains of 25%, then 33%, 50% and 100%. Such acceleration often appears before a stock breaks out and launches a big price run.


But what if, say, the Internet search giant **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) hypothetically reports \$1 EPS in the first quarter of 2011? The stock would probably crash. Why?


That dollar would compare with \$6.76 in Q1 2010, an 85% drop. Google would still be making money, but not nearly enough to support its current price. (Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect Google to earn \$8.09, up 20%.)


What if Google reports, say, \$7.10 per share in the current first quarter of this year? That likely would still be bad news. At \$7.10, Google's EPS would be up just 5% from the result seen in Q1 of last year.


Google's four most recent quarterly reports showed earnings gains of 31%, 20%, 30% and 29%. So a 5% increase would be a clear deceleration of results, and Google's weakest such report since Q1 2009.


While any deceleration warrants attention, any great company can have an off quarter. Let's say a company's earnings per share grew 30%, 45%, 65% and 40%. Yes, growth slowed in the latest quarter, but it's still a robust increase. Even pitching great Sandy Koufax lost a game once in a while.


The red flag should be raised when the rate of growth falls by at least two-thirds. Weak sales growth or falling profit margins can signal slowing EPS increases.


Let's go back to Google. Be alert if Q1's EPS comes in at \$7.47 or less. That would come to just 10% growth, or two-thirds less than the 29% seen in the fourth quarter of last year.


"In most cases, sell when the percentage increases in quarterly earnings slow materially (or by two-thirds from the prior rate of increase) for two consecutive quarters," William O'Neil, founder and chairman of IBD, wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Sometimes it just takes one nasty earnings surprise to abruptly end a stock's rally. Medical software developer **Quality Systems** ([QSII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSII)) had been a star in the mid-2000s. The company's software aided medical-practice management and patients' electronic record keeping and was thriving as doctors were scrambling to transfer patient histories from paper to computers.


In the four quarters before the fateful release, Quality Systems had logged profit gains of 60%, 50%, 46% and 54%. But the fiscal Q3 of 2005 showed an earnings rise of just 9%. The stock dived 19% that week **1** and logged a monster-volume downside reversal.

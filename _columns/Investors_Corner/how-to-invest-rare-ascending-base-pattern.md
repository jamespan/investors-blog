Diligent [stock chart analysis](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) is key to learning how to invest in growth stocks successfully. Those who take the time to learn the ascending base, one of the rarer patterns, will have a better chance of pinpointing new buy points and achieving bigger returns.

If identified properly, this base can lead to big gains. While the definition of an ascending base sounds relatively straightforward — three pullbacks amid a series of higher price highs and higher price lows — context matters a great deal.

Leading stocks create ascending bases during periods of market weakness. The stock continually hits a new high, but is dragged down by the general market.

## The Parameters Of The Base

Ascending bases are typically nine to 16 weeks in duration, starting with the first week down within the first pullback. In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William J. O'Neil notes that the depth of each pullback ranges from 10%-20%. The [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) Pattern Recognition algorithm scans for three pullbacks that correct between 6% and 25% to help compensate for a stock's individual volatility.

Small-cap stocks tend to trade with more volatility than large-cap stocks, but both can form these bullish base formations.

OpenTable traded under the ticker symbol OPEN before it was acquired by Priceline Group — now **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)) — in 2014 for \$2.6 billion.

In the first pullback, the online restaurant-reservation service dropped 17% from May 18 to June 8 **(1)**. The next pullback was 12.4% deep, from June 18 to July 1 **(2)**. Finally, the last pullback showed milder action, as the stock slid just over 9% from July 13 to 16 **(3)**.

It makes a new high during two of the three pullbacks, indicating that the stock is ready to become a market leader, but an uncooperative general market is holding it back.

## The Breakout

Shares broke out on July 26 when it barely peeked above the 46.66 buy point. But the stock wasn't ready at that point to advance.

Finally, on Aug. 4, the stock surged back above the [buy point](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) with a 217% increase in volume **(4)**. Almost four weeks later, on Sept. 1, the general market would [follow through](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) to the upside, kicking off a solid uptrend. From there, the stock rose more than 150%. Shares peaked on April 25, 2011, at 118.66.

But as quickly as the stock advanced, it fell even faster. On May 4, the stock crashed through its 50-day moving average in huge volume — a [potential sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). Earnings results were slightly ahead of analyst targets, but not good enough to live up to its lofty expectations.

Through the end of November, the stock had plummeted as much as 73% off its 118.66 all-time high.

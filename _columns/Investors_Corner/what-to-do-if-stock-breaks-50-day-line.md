**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

Should an investor take profits in a stock if heavy volume accompanies a sharp break of the 50-day or 10-week moving average? Yes! If a stock falls below its 50-day line in heavy trade and can't seem to bounce back, buying demand may be drying up fast. That could mark the end of a stock's run.

These lines act as a price support level for market leaders during an uptrend, but can also serve as resistance in a downtrend.

A severe drop can occur when fund managers decide to take profits off the table and sell big positions. So it's prudent to look for signs of heavy institutional selling, especially after a big run-up.

It can take a mutual fund several weeks to exit a position, so bouts of institutional selling often occur more than just once or twice. For individual investors, following the big money's lead is often the best bet.

The 50-day moving average, plotted on a daily chart, is calculated by taking a running average of price closes from the past 50 trading sessions. The 10-week line is plotted on a weekly chart.

If a stock falls sharply below its 50-day or 10-week line in heavy volume, that's a sell signal. The big money is selling. This is where volume comes into play. If the stock falls 8% below what you paid, that also triggers a sell.

**Kate Spade** ([KATE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KATE)) kicked off the left side of a late-stage cup base in March 2014. Before the handle started forming seven weeks later, down days in above-average trade outpaced big-volume up days by a 4 to 1 margin, a negative sign. In a base, volume should be healthy on the upside.

Volume dried up along the handle, as you'd like to see. On June 19, the maker of designer handbags and women's luxury accessories cleared a 38.42 buy point but closed lower for the day and below the entry in below-average trade **(1)**. The next session, the stock rose nearly 3% in turnover 66% higher than usual.

Instead of following through, it headed mostly lower over the next few weeks, again with rising volume on more down days than up days. The stock even briefly undercut the 50-day line on July 8 **(2)** . Kate resumed its climb in uninspiring volume, followed by declines in fast trade.

On Aug. 12, it staged a huge downward reversal from a new high and crashed 25% in massive volume, slicing both its 50-day and 200-day lines 3. It's now trading near 25.

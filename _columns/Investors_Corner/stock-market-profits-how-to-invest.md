IBD founder and Chairman [William O'Neil](http://www.williamoneil.com/) teaches that one key to success in the stock market is not just to be right on a stock but also to make big money when you're right.


Experienced investors know that when the dust settles after a rally, the lion's share of your profits will be in one or two stocks. If you're managing your portfolio correctly, then your path will have been littered with a few small losses, and you will have harvested some moderate gains along the way.


One way to make money when you're right is to make sure you have a sizeable position when you start off. Some investors may buy large positions in a stock on which they have conviction, then take smaller positions in issues of which they are unsure.


Sometimes, however, the stocks that you are uncertain of are the ones that skyrocket. So take equal-sized positions. Decide how many positions you're going to own, and divide your portfolio accordingly.


Don't diversify too much by owning dozens of stocks. It's too difficult to keep track of them. You're less likely to water down your performance if you concentrate your positions in a few very promising issues.


An investor with \$3,000 should limit himself or herself to two positions. A portfolio of \$5,000 to \$20,000 should have three stocks. For a \$20,000 to \$200,000 portfolio, own four or five equally weighted positions. Even an investor with more than \$1 million should hold just six or seven names. If you're uncomfortable with so few, you might consider 10 to 12, but not dozens.


Scale into the stock, making it prove its strength before you buy more. Buy half of the intended full position size at the exact buy point, another 30% of a full position after it advances 2% and the rest before the stock reaches 5% from the buy point.


If you realize that you might have a big winner on your hands, you can add small amounts at strategic moments, such as when your stock makes a three-weeks-tight pattern or successfully tests its 50-day or 10-week moving averages the first two times out of a base.


Keep the additions small. Adding 5% of your purchase price, or certainly no more than 10%, is acceptable. Keep an eagle eye on your average cost, and keep it close to your initial buy point. You might mark your average price with a line on a chart.


You will be surprised how big a position you can build with capital appreciation and by adding small amounts at the right time.


Assume an investor has a \$40,000 portfolio spread among four stocks. But one seems particularly speculative, so the investor buys only a half position of \$5,000.


During a robust six-month rally, stock A advances 20%, and the investor sells it. Stock B advances 25% and is sold. Stock C is sold for a 7% loss. Stock D, the seemingly speculative name, more than doubles. The investor walks off with a 9.5% overall gain.


What if the investor had put a full position into Stock D, then added 5% of its purchase price when the stock formed a three-weeks-tight pattern 20% above the original buy point? Let's say that the investor buys another 5% worth of stock when it bounced off the 50-day line 30% above the buy point. The stock rises another 70% and is sold. Total profit: 45%.

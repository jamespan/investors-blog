The path for a small, illiquid stock on Wall Street to becoming a respected, institutional-quality name usually zigs and zags, with plenty of potholes along the way.

  

That's certainly been the case for heart device maker **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)). But its shares are up about 125% this year, compared to a modest increase for the S&P 500.

  

The company, with a market capitalization of around \$3.6 billion, provides medical devices for circulatory support. Its Impella family of products helps the heart rest by improving blood flow or the heart's pumping.

  

Three main models on the market are the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 — each named for the liters of blood flow pumped per minute — and the Impella CP, which can adjust the flow of blood per minute. In late October, the company said that the installed base for Impella 2.5 grew by 27 hospitals, bringing the total to 1,000 sites. Meanwhile, 45 new hospitals bought the Impella CP, raising the number of sites to 739.

  

Revenue growth and mutual fund ownership has ramped up in recent quarters as the company's product line continues to gain traction in hospitals around the world.

  

But it hasn't all been a bed of roses for Abiomed. Shares plunged almost 29% on Oct. 29 after the company reported fiscal second-quarter results. Another quarter of big earnings and sales growth was offset by full-year sales guidance that implied a considerable slowdown — 24% to 28% growth in the second half of the year vs. 49% in the first. The company forecast 2016 sales of \$305 million to \$315 million, up 32% to 37% from the prior year.

  

Still, earnings jumped 89% from the year-earlier quarter, while sales grew 47% to \$76.4 million. The company's Impella products accounted for almost 94% of total sales in the quarter.

  

Fiscal 2016 earnings are expected to decelerate sharply this year but then ramp back up in 2017, rising 49% to \$1.04 a share.

  

In the second half of 2014, the stock was moving sideways with an average daily volume just north of 200,000 shares, too thinly traded to be on the radar screen of institutional investors. Abiomed had some sponsorship at the time, but the stock was still struggling to get noticed.

  

However, an FDA headline changed all that, and shares surging 24% on Oct. 30. The company reported earnings, but Wall Street was more excited about an agreement with the FDA that made full approval of its Impella 2.5 heart pump more likely. The FDA first approved the pump in 2008 for a narrow indication, but in March 2015 the pump received full FDA approval.

  

This year, the stock was no stranger to earnings-related gaps up in price. On Jan. 28, May 5 and Aug. 4, shares soared on strong earnings.

  

Chartwise, Abiomed is in a price consolidation. It recently pulled back 38% off its recent high **(1)**. While that's generally considered deep for a proper base, it's not out of line for Abiomed, considering the scope of its recent gains.

  

A sell-off Oct. 29 that followed the company's most recent results left a bearish mark on the pattern. Much of the base has formed below the 10-week average, another drawback.

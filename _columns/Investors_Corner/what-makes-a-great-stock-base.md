Just as a savory dish is often made with a variety of ingredients, many elements come together to form a great base.

Bases are chart patterns that form as a stock corrects and digests its gains following a strong prior run-up.

A stock can boast strong fundamentals and belong to a leading industry group or sector. But those qualities alone aren't enough to warrant a buy. This is when a stock's daily and weekly charts come into play. They help investors track not only a stock's price and volume action but also new bases that set up the next big run.

"It's not enough to buy a stock simply because it has good fundamental characteristics, like strong earnings and sales," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

"In fact, no Investor's Business Daily reader should ever buy a stock based solely on IBD's proprietary SmartSelect Ratings. A stock's chart must always be checked to determine whether the stock is in a proper position to buy, or whether it is the stock of a sound, leading company but is too far extended in price above a solid basing area and thus should temporarily be avoided."

Leading stocks make their biggest moves after breaking out from proper bases. It's difficult to know when the optimal time to buy shares is if you don't know how to spot or interpret a stock's basing pattern. Buying at the wrong time raises downside risk.

Keep in mind that all bases are not created equal â€” nor are all good bases perfect. And there are various patterns, including the cup, cup without handle, flat base, double-bottom and so forth. But there are some basic similarities, which will be covered in detail in subsequent columns.

For now, remember these key points to check when studying bases: the length of the base; the size of the decline; the smoothness of price action; visual symmetry; and the importance of accumulation, which indicates that savvy institutional investors are eagerly grabbing and holding shares before the actual breakout occurs.

The size of the decline, or correction, in a cup base should generally be between 12% and 33%. In a severe bear market, deeper bases may form.

A proper cup base needs to span a minimum of seven weeks, while a flat base can be as short as five weeks. Some bases form handles. A proper handle forms in the upper half of a base and drifts slightly downward along its price lows. Volume should mostly ease until the breakout.

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) got off to a rocky start right after rocketing 470% above an IPO price of 27 on its Aug. 5, 2005, market debut. But the stock eventually came back to form a series of bases on its way up, including the one shown in the daily chart above.

In early January 2007, it began shaping a base. The stock pulled back 31%, in proper range. Volume slowed along the bottom of the base as the stock found support at its 200-day moving average. The right side of the base formed in a hurry as the stock gapped up and soared 14% on April 27 **(1)**.

Turnover fell sharply as it shaped a handle, then surged 110% on May 14 as Baidu briefly rose above a 132.90 buy point **(2)**. The stock pulled back slightly below the entry but soon cleared it again. Baidu gained 223% in the next six months.

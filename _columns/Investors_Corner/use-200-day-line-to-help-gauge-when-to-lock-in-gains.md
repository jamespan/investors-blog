Buying a leading stock at exactly the right time is hard enough.


But once an investor lands a winning stock or two comes an even tougher decision — when to sell.


In a fantasy world, all stocks will keep rising. But on Wall Street, even the best stocks need time to digest heady gains and set up their next rally. So how can you gauge how far up is too far?


One prudent course of action is to take at least partial profits when a stock is up more than 20% from the proper buy point. An investor can lock in some gains while letting remaining shares ride — for a while.


When you've been holding a great stock for six months, 12 months or longer, and now it's cooling off, what should you do?


The 200-day moving average, which shows a stock's price trend over the past 200 trading sessions, can also help investors make a decision on when to hold or sell. There are different ways to use the line.


View a daily chart to calculate the distance between the current stock price and the 200-day line. If the price is 70% to 100% or more past that level, it may be time to consider selling.


Let's say you're sitting on a gain well above 25% when the stock starts pulling back to the 200-day. That doesn't necessarily trigger a sale, especially when you have a fat profit cushion. Monitor whether it finds support there and heads back up. The 200-day should rise or be flat.


IBD research shows that the 200-day often serves as a support level where a stock can build a new base and break out to new highs.


**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) had its biggest run during the 1990s. The Internet-gear giant consistently found support above its 200-day moving average (or 40-week line on a weekly chart) until the mid-'90s.


It reset its base count in 1994 as the stock carved a deep cup-with-handle base before embarking on its next rally. Cisco cleared a 19.04 buy point (adjusted for a 2-1 split) the week ended March 31, 1995, in huge volume.


From there, Cisco surged 135% to a new high in early November **1**, then pulled back to its 40-week line **2** by January 2006.


Worried investors who didn't take profits on the way up could have locked in some gains during this time. But even when Cisco touched its 40-week line, it was still 101% above the entry.


After finding support at the 40-week, it rebounded higher to break out of a second-stage base.

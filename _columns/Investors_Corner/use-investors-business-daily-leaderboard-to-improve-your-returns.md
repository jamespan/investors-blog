Imagine having IBD's markets team sitting at your side as you make your decisions over which growth stocks to buy and which ones to avoid.


In essence, that's the [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/products/default.aspx?id=trial&sec=startsection&src=ablbkd6) experience.


Launched in July 2011, this IBD premium online product brings together decades of analysis, experience, knowledge and research in the proven CAN SLIM investment model. It could make a big difference in your portfolio decisions.


Leaderboard helps you in a number of practical ways.


From the Investors.com home page, click on Leaderboard, and you'll land on the Leaders section. This presents the market's very best stocks.


Very best how? In all the ways that characterize winning stocks: fundamentals, institutional sponsorship and chart action (a fancy way of saying the stock's price-and-volume behavior).


Fundamentals are closely scrutinized, such as earnings and sales growth, margins, and the health of a company's industry. The analysis includes all of IBD's proprietary ratings.


Any stock considered for Leaderboard goes through a more punishing vetting than most potential vice-presidential candidates. Most stock candidates are rejected; indeed, almost all. But that's the way it should be.


Leaders are divided into two groups. First you'll find stocks near a correct buy point. This is where the action is. The stock has just broken out or is rebounding from a test of the 10-week moving average.


If there are problems, you'll find them mentioned in a summary updated at least once a day. These stocks tend not to have many flaws, though.


Below these stocks you'll find the rest of the Leaders, those that may still be forming a base or are beyond the 5% reach of their breakout point.


**What A Chart Tells You**


Note the annotations found on the daily and weekly charts of each stock. They attempt to answer crucial questions, such as: What's right about the chart? What's wrong with it? Where should I buy the stock? And finally, when should I sell it?


These useful comments help bring the chart together for you in a meaningful way.


The IBD 50 also can be found in Leaderboard, with a focus on the Top 10. This is a computer-generated list, but each of the top 10 charts is annotated in the same way as the Leaders list.


The Cut List includes Leaders that have flashed sell signals and should be cut from your portfolio. Potential short-sale candidates also will appear on the Cut List. Here, too, the vetting is merciless.


So what good does all this do you?


First, you can compare your own work to that of the same IBD markets team you've been relying on for years.


What did you miss? Why isn't Leaderboard including some stocks on your own watch list? You may learn much from comparing the two lists. Perhaps one of your favorites on your focus list may have less trading volume or isn't the best in its industry.


Leaderboard also can help you winnow down your watch list. Because Leaderboard has relatively few stocks, it helps narrow your focus of research.

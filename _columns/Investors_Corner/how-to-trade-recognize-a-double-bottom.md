Winning stocks usually catch their breath at some point.


When they do that, their stock charts show a period of price consolidation, or what IBD often calls a "base taking shape."


The most common types of bases are the cup pattern, the cup-with-handle structure, the flat base and the double bottom.


This column will look at the double bottom, focusing on the one that **Rackspace Hosting** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)) etched from late December 2009 through early September 2010.


A double bottom looks like the letter W.


Generally, the second bottom should undercut the first bottom. This signals a shakeout of weaker investors.


The buy point comes from the middle peak in that W-like structure. That peak should be in the upper half of the base. A double-bottom also could sport a handle, but it's not essential.


Other points to keep in mind: This pattern doesn't occur as frequently as the cup with handle, but it still occurs often. The minimum length for the pattern is seven weeks.


And this type of base usually features a more severe correction, although no more than a 50% drop from its peak to its trough.


Rackspace, a cloud-computing play, corrected 36% from its December 2009 high at 23.51 **1** to its June 2010 low at 15.15 **2**.


It took far more than seven weeks to take shape, needing about 10 months to develop.


The entry point was at 21.46. That stems from adding a dime to the middle peak in Rackspace's W-like pattern **3**.


Rackspace jumped beyond 21.46 on Sept. 10, 2010 **4**.


On the actual day of the breakout, daily volume came in just 13% above average â€” not as convincing as you would like.


But in the prior session (Sept. 9), volume was 29% above average, and in the following session (Sept. 13) turnover was 28% faster than normal. So that should have encouraged any IBD-style investor worried about volume for this breakout. Plus, volume surged in following weeks **5**.


Rackspace basically didn't look back after this breakout. It rallied as much as 117%, hitting a peak of 46.49 in May of this year.

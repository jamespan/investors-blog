The stock market is a dramatic place, where fortunes can be earned or lost in a single day. 

  

One of the most dramatic events within this world is a follow-through day. These unusual trading sessions — when one or more major indexes mark sizable gains in increased volume — convert an attempted new rally (after a significant correction) into a confirmed uptrend.

  

Not all follow-throughs work out well. Sometimes the market will reverse and fall to new lows. But going back to all major market bottoms since 1900, each one featured a follow-through day.

  

[Follow-through](http://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/?termID=5963&term=Follow-Through+Day+Concept&mode=searchResults) gains are generally well above 1%. If the follow-through succeeds, it will be accompanied by a growing number of highly rated stocks breaking out of bases to new highs in heavy trade. The sessions give investors a chance to get the money seed in, to pyramid capital into watch-listed stocks, and to lay out their bets for the coming rally.

  

It is important to keep a heads-up attitude. Understand the psychological conditions that preface a follow-through. When it happens, most investors are scared or bearish.

  

Be mentally prepared for a potential market turn, and recognize these confirmations as they occur. Investors should already be in possession of carefully vetted stock candidates before follow-through days occur.

  

An attempted rally starts when a correcting index bottoms, then turns higher. Sometimes this happens in a single session. Other times, the index bottoms one day, then moves higher the following session. That up day counts as Day 1 of a new rally attempt.

  

Follow-through days take place four or more sessions into the new rally attempt. Once in a while, they can occur earlier. But uptrends based on early follow-throughs have a higher tendency to be short-lived.

  

Uptrends can resume without follow-through days. They tend to follow shallow corrections, typically triggered as an index takes a new high — such as when the Nasdaq made a high on Aug. 5, then fell 3.3%. It made a new high Sept. 9, and the uptrend resumed.

  

In either case, investors should wait for uptrends to be confirmed before moving capital back into the market. Confirmations — either a follow-through day or a new high — mark a shift in institutional investors' overall attitude from selling to buying.

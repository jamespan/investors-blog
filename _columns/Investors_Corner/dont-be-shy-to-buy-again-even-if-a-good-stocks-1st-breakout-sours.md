Remember the saying, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again"? In stock investing, you have to be prepared to do just that. It might take several buys before a stock starts moving your way.

Trading is not as easy as just hitting the buy button on a sound stock that's breaking out of a textbook chart pattern in heavy volume. You can't expect every stock you buy to be a big winner the first time you buy it.

Even if you bought the true leader in a top-ranked group, you can still be prone to a shakeout. Or two.

An analyst downgrade or just general market noise can stop you out, even in a solid market uptrend. While this can be frustrating, don't fret. Since breakout stocks are at or near new highs, they often feel turbulence before getting going.

So if you happen to get shaken out, don't give up and move on to another stock. The stock that just handed you a loss may not be dead yet. It may still become a winner.

Continue to pay attention to its price-and-volume action, especially if you still have conviction in the stock. If it takes out its latest buy point again, don't be afraid to take a second shot or even a third.

Investors may try buying a larger position the second time around. It may seem contrary to conventional wisdom. But it may help boost one's psychology and confidence in the stock.

**![ICch_msb_080916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ICch_msb_080916-300x173.jpg)Mesabi Trust** ([MSB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSB)) went on a big run in 2010. The New York-based firm owns iron-ore-rich land in Minnesota.

Instead of digging up the iron ore itself, Mesabi lets other companies do the dirty work. Royalties are paid to Mesabi Trust, which passes on most of the royalties as a distribution to shareholders.

The stock had solid IBD Ratings before breaking out: Composite Rating of 94, 85 Earnings Per Share and 98 Relative Price Strength.

On Aug. 17, 2010, Mesabi Trust blew past a 25.87 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Volume surged 245% above average that day, far exceeding the 40% requirement for a breakout **(1)**.

Two days later, the stock reversed lower. On Aug. 25, Mesabi Trust fell more than 8% below the 25.87 trigger **(2)**. But three sessions after that, the stock again cleared the handle entry in heavy trade **(3)**.

Mesabi Trust more than doubled before its December top. Sometimes, the second mouse -- or the second try -- gets the cheese.

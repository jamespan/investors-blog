Light beer doesn't cut it with hard-core beer drinkers. Light blended coffee would be spit out on first gulp by the designer-coffee set. And light verse is a joke to everybody.


Is it any surprise that the market often punishes a stock that rebounds in light volume?


Here we must pause to acknowledge those old-school newspaper people who would argue that if it's "light volume" it can't truly be a "rebound," any more than a "veggie burger" is truly a "burger."


The market seems to agree with the curmudgeons on rebounds (it has no known stance on the veggie-burger issue, though).


After a stock logs a long run-up, makes a significant top, then slides hard on beefy volume, an upward price reaction in light volume isn't the real thing. You can treat this as a prime opportunity to take profits in your winner.


Heavy-volume declines immediately followed by light upward action suggests two things: Funds are feverishly selling shares, and yet fewer heavyweight investors are interested in buying.


In this negative balance between supply and demand, you don't want to fight that situation. Although American culture romanticizes the loner going up against overwhelming odds, you'll want to leave that idea to Clint Eastwood characters at the movies. Fight the market, and eventually you will be crushed.


Sometimes, what you avoid is merely another base-building process. Even then, there are benefits to dodging a downturn.


Five years ago, **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) was riding high. In March 2006, the company reported quarterly earnings that blew past estimates. Earnings were \$5.03 a share vs. the \$3.30 that the Street expected.


By April 20, the stock had advanced 33% in less than four months **1**. The stock had strong ratings. The Composite Rating was 98, putting it above all but 2% of the stocks in IBD's database in terms of overall quality. The industry group's ranking was high. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating was B+.


But on Friday, April 28, 2006 and May 1, the stock plunged 2.2% and 2.4%, respectively. Volume was above average and the heaviest in the past month **2**.


The stock attempted to rally over the next six sessions, but volume was light each day **3**.


Goldman Sachs declined as it began work on what turned out to be a new four-month base (please see a historical chart).


An investor who sold into the light-volume rally attempt would've locked in some profits, avoided the ride down, freed the funds for other investments and had a chance to re-enter the stock when it broke out of the subsequent base.


From that breakout in mid-September of 2006, Goldman Sachs rose 32% in three months.

[2013: A Look Back And Ahead](http://news.investors.com/special-report/638663-2013-a-look-back-and-ahead.aspx)


Everybody would like to find the stock that makes big gains and is easy to hold.


Investing, though, doesn't always work out that way. Sometimes, a winning stock is hard to play.


If you're going to have consistent success in the stock market, you're going to have to learn how to play the hard cases.


**Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)), a maker of 3D printers, was such a stock in 2012.


On paper, the small cap was a big gainer this year. It ended 2011 at 30.41 and rose 160% to a peak of 79.25 by late November.


How much of that gain could an IBD investor have snagged?


The buy-and-hold camp could interrupt here to argue that all of the gain was available, except for the modest pull off the high.


The flaw is that buy-and-hold investors can just as easily latch onto a flat or losing issue. And if the market turns south, they have no protection.


Also, such investors tend to be in the diversification camp, which means a big stock gain isn't a big gain for the portfolio.


IBD's approach is based on timing buys and sales and concentrating a portfolio on a handful of stocks at most.


So back to our question: What did Stratasys offer the IBD-style investor?


Stratasys began the year by rising without offering a valid entry. That happens sometimes.


The first breakout came April 16 when the stock broke past a 41.85 buy point in strong volume. **(1**) Yet, the IBD investor wouldn't have bought the stock. The market was in a correction.


Stratasys rose 28% past the buy point intraday April 20, but staged an ugly reversal to finish 5% down (visible only on the daily chart). The action would've chased out many investors.


The stock then consolidated, offering an entry July 18. **(2)** The uptrend was under pressure, but buys are allowed in such markets. After clearing a 54.47 handle, Stratasys rose 28% in about four weeks. A new consolidation would've forced investors to take profits before losing most of the 35% gain. **(3)**


The stock next shaped its most recent pattern â€” a third-stage base, which is more prone to fail. But so far, Stratasys is moving in a healthy direction.


Stratasys' over-arching lesson: Sometimes an investor must take the good that is offered and forget about the perfect.

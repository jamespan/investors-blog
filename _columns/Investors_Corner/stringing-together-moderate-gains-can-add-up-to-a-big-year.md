  How You Can Generate Income From Investing Purely In Growth Stocks

It's an article of faith among some investors, especially those with experience in buying and selling growth stocks, that you can't take profits out of your portfolio to cover living or leisure expenses unless you have profits to show for the year.


But it's entirely possible to take out regular increments annually, regardless of whether you have a profit or not, and still grow your portfolio over the long run.


The trick is to make the amounts you withdraw small and regular -- say, 3% to 5% a year. This approach might work particularly well in a retirement account.


Let's say that you start with a \$100,000 portfolio. For the sake of simplicity, let's say you invest all of it in a single growth stock that has broken out of a base while the market is in a confirmed uptrend sometime in January. By May, the stock is up 20%, so you sell. Your portfolio is now worth \$120,000. During June, you discover another fast-growing company whose stock is just beginning to break out of a base. You plow your portfolio into it.


By September, your stock is up 20%, and you sell. You are now sitting on \$144,000. After a brief correction in the market, the major indexes head north again, signaling a new uptrend. You use all of that \$144,000 in cash, buy a third stock and sell for a 20% gain by year's end. You now have \$172,800. You've locked in a profit of 72.8% for the year. Even if you proceed to have a flat year or two in a row, you can still draw income from those gains without eating into your principal.


The reality will never be as perfect as the theory. It's not wise to put all your money in one stock. The cost of a mistake is too high. Sometimes, a stock will break down, and you'll be forced to sell for a big loss. But if you always keep your losses small, even a string of losing trades shouldn't hurt you too much.


Here's an example of how an investor could achieve strong gains with just three stocks and grow the portfolio enough to harvest income.


You buy shares of **CommVault** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) just under 60 as it finds support at its 50-day moving average and bounces off it with gusto on Oct. 31, 2012. It has a big day on Feb. 1, 2013, closing at 79.53. A sell at the closing price generates a 33% profit.


In 2013, more growth stocks move higher. A passel of them break out during the summer. One is **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)), which clears a cup-with-handle base on Sept. 3, 2013, with a 58.21 buy point. You sell on Oct. 14 at the closing price of 68.89 for an 18% profit.


You decide to go sailing around the world, taking a break from the market. Then you return with fresh eyes and charged-up mental batteries. In 2014, you spot an emerging new leader in the airline industry. You go into **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) in the week ending Oct. 24, 2014, as the stock bursts past a 16.18 double-bottom entry point. You decide to follow IBD's key sell rule of taking gains once a stock rises 20% to 25% from the breakout; so, five weeks later, you take gains at 20.23, a 25% profit.

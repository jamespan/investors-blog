The Internet age provides all sorts of heartwarming stories. Think grandparents doing video chats with their grandkids, or childhood friends reconnecting via Facebook.

It also has made it easier for short-sellers to broadcast a negative assessment of a stock that they've bet against.

That's hardly heartwarming if you hold shares in the company being targeted. In recent months, **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)) and **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) are among the issues that have received that treatment and dropped.

This Investor's Corner column aims to offer some approaches to dealing with trash talk by people with a short position.

• **Don't hate the players.** Short-selling is hard. After all, the stock market has a natural upward bias in the long run.

So don't boo the bears too much when they get it right. They are also often wrong.

Some of them have conducted extensive research before making their bets. Long-only investors also ought to invest lots of time in reading up and really knowing a company. That's often a better use of your time than trying to trash talk back.

• **Focus on true leaders.** Every big market uptrend will have a few clear winners.

In its recent run-ups, the true leaders have included names such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).

These are old friends for most IBD readers. You saw them again and again — or continue to see them — in the IBD 50 (and in its predecessor, the IBD 100).

A key to IBD's investing approach is identifying these true leaders and focusing on them like a laser.

Their fundamentals help set them apart. Not only do these winners have strong percentage gains in quarterly profit and revenue, but some of the actual figures are huge.

Baidu's quarterly revenue has been above \$100 million for several years. Apple has long had more than \$7 billion in sales each quarter. Contrast that with Northern Oil's quarterly revenue, which was \$11.2 million last quarter.

• **Big caps offer protection.** Sure, some giants like **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) have fallen hard in recent years. But in general, mid and large-cap stocks will have more stability.

So if you're holding a highflier or two with a small market cap, it's prudent to have some exposure to leaders with a \$5 billion to \$10 billion market cap or more.

You'll be glad that you did if the small cap ends up taking a tumble following some bearish commentary from a short-seller.

• **Regardless, sell on technicals.** Here's another key to IBD's investing strategy: Make buy decisions using fundamentals and technicals, and sell mainly on technicals.

"Mainly on technicals" means that you generally can decide whether or not to sell by scrutinizing your stock's chart.

Did the stock slice through its 10-week moving average in huge volume and finish the week below that line? That's a possible sell sign.

It indicates that some institutional investors have bailed out.

The most important thing is to recognize such bearish action and strongly consider selling. You can argue with a negative assessment of a stock, but it's hard to argue with chart action and sell signals. IBD recently ran a special series on 22 sell rules that remains available on Investors.com.

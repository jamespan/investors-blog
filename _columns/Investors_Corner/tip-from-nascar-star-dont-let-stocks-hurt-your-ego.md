_Fourth In A Series_

"The winner ain't the one with the fastest car," famed stock car driver Dale Earnhardt Sr. used to say. "It's the one who refuses to lose."

Earnhardt knew about getting bumped, and he never let it psych him out of a race. Winners in the stock market play a similar game.

Leading stocks have many ways of shaking out weak investors. Corrections and handles show a stock consolidating its ownership into fewer and more steady hands.

Sometimes a stock will come under selling pressure after a breakout. Anxious shareholders take profits at the first possible chance.

The result — a pullback after a breakout — is not uncommon.

Generally that pullback will just return for a test of support at the 10-week moving average, then reverse and move higher. But sometimes it cuts through support and triggers the 7% to 8% sell rule. Go ahead and follow the rules and sell your shares. Just remember: Selling at 8% is preserving capital and staying prepared for a better breakout.

Don't confuse that with losing.

Sure, it stings a little. Even the most skilled drivers win some, lose some and wreck some, as Earnhardt used to say. But the pros get right back on the track and look for an opening.

And that opening may come from the stock that shook you out. It may have stung your pride, but you've already done your research. You know the stock.

If it fits the leadership mold and the market is healthy, chances are good it will go on to book additional gains.

So keep it on your radar. Even if it drops to test 200-day support, it may come right back up through its original buy point. That still counts as a valid buy.

Maybe it will swing down into another consolidation, build a base and break out a few weeks or even months later. Many top stocks, including those on the IBD 50, go through a volatile stage, shaking out investors and chewing up their chart patterns before settling into a more stable, winning run.

Make sure you're not looking the other way, licking your wounds when that run starts. Earnhardt's advice: "You can't let one bad moment spoil a bunch of good ones."

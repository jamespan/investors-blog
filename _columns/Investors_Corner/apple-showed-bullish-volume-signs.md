IBD readers will find many references to volume in market columns. Why? "Volume is your best measure of supply and demand and institutional sponsorship — two vital ingredients in successful stock analysis," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "Learn how to use charts to time your purchases correctly.

"This means that all of the selling has been exhausted and there is very little coming into the marketplace," O'Neil added. "Healthy stocks that are under accumulation almost always show this symptom."

Acquiring the skill to interpret a stock's volume activity helps investors recognize whether a stock is under accumulation or distribution — i.e., serious buying or selling by mutual funds and other big players, which account for the majority of each day's market action.

In a sound base, you typically see high volume along the left side, which usually begins forming as a stock comes off of its high. High turnover as the stock comes down points to distribution.

**Tight Closes, Light Volume**

As selling tails off, look for lighter trade as the stock starts working on the bottom of the base. The ideal combination to look for is tight action (daily or weekly price closes near each other) and the drying up of volume along the bottom.

Volume may pick up as more institutional investors step up to buy shares, helping the stock shape the right side of its base. Many cup-shape bases go on to form a handle prior to their breakout. Here again, it's best to see volume dry up along the lowest part of a downward-drifting handle.

In 2004, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) carved a cup-with-handle base that displayed some ideal volume action. The stock started the left side of the pattern in the week ended Oct. 17, 2003, as it pulled back from a 52-week high.

It corrected 23% from the left peak to the bottom of the base, within normal range for a cup pattern. Volume was heavy as the stock kicked off the left side of the base **(1)**.

But volume tailed off considerably during the weeks that followed. Apple logged only three down weeks in above-average trade while shaping the base's left side.

In an ideal world, the stock would notch faster turnover on up weeks or support weeks — when it closes down, but in the upper half or 60% of the week's range. That type of action suggests mutual funds and other big players are holding, or even adding, shares.

When studying basing patterns, you generally want to see heavy volume in more up weeks than down weeks. But keep in mind that's just one of many traits investors should look for in potential buy candidates.

In Apple's case, the lack of high-volume up weeks didn't seem to ultimately matter. Volume spiked the week ended Jan. 9, 2004, as the stock crafted the right side of its base **(2)**. Heavier trade followed the next week, which also served as the start of a handle. But volume dried up, coming in below average as the handle continued forming over the next six weeks.

Apple finally cleared its 24.94 handle buy point the first week of March, surging 12% in turnover much faster than usual **(3)**.

Whether a stock is shaping a base or breaking out, tracking volume is key to stock analysis.

"Big volume at key points is indispensable," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil writes in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "Volume is your best measure of supply and demand and institutional sponsorship."

Volume trends can help investors spot whether mutual funds and other big players are, on net, buying (accumulation) or selling (distribution) shares.

Since institutional investors make up the bulk of a stock's price move, it's best to swim with the tide.

How can you track if the big money is buying or selling shares? One key gauge is found on a stock's daily or weekly chart.

The red and blue bars along the bottom represent each day or week's trading levels. Blue bars represent volume during an up day or week; red bars stand for trading levels on down sessions.

When a stock is forming a base, you'd want to see volume dry up along the bottom, suggesting the big money is holding shares. Conversely, heavy downside volume shows selling by mutual funds.

There is an exception, though. While building the left side, if a stock closes in the upper 60% of its weekly range during a down week in heavy volume, that can be considered accumulation. Buyers may be offsetting a rash of sellers, resulting in a support week.

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which appears on IBD's minicharts and in the research tables, shows if there has been more buying or selling activity by institutions in recent months. An A or B Rating points to strong accumulation, or heavy buying by mutual funds. A D or E points to a high amount of distribution, while a C is neutral.

Also check the up-down volume ratio found in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx). It's derived by dividing a stock's up-day volume by its down-day volume during the past 50 days. A ratio over 1.0 suggests more upside volume vs. downside.

**Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) started consolidating in late April 2006 after resetting its base count. It shaped a 20-week cup with handle, during which there were four weeks of accumulation, or heavy-volume up weeks.

Two downside weeks in May and June also counted as accumulation as the stock closed near the upper 60% of its range **1**. Volume dried up as the handle formed, then spiked at the breakout past 45.28 in September **2**.

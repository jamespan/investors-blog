It hasn't been an easy year for growth investors, but it didn't stop the market from delivering some solid winners. The common bond among them? Strong fundamentals.

  

Shares of **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) are up by close to 70% this year. Earnings and sales growth have ramped up in recent quarters, fueling the stock's price performance.

  

The point of looking at past stock market winners is to know what they looked like from a fundamental and technical perspective before their big price move. The goal is to apply that knowledge to your current research. If decades of IBD research show one thing, it's that history repeats itself in the stock market.

  

Illumina makes life science tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function. It caters to a variety of customers, from academic institutions and government laboratories to big pharmaceutical and biotech firms.

  

In January 2012, the Swiss drug giant **Roche** ([RHHBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHHBY)) announced a \$5.7 billion hostile bid for Illumina. Roche sweetened the bid a few months later, but a deal never came to fruition.

  

It hasn't always been a bed of roses for Illumina. In 2011, the stock lost two-thirds of its market value as profit and sales growth ground to a halt. But Illumina shows how turnaround stories can be highly profitable. The stock found its footing in 2012 on improving fundamentals.

  

Illumina cleared a cup-shaped base in April 2013, then surged nearly 12% two weeks later, after the company reported strong Q1 results. Earnings rose 28% from a year ago, and sales rose 21%. The results marked the third straight quarter where earnings and sales growth exceeded 20%.

  

At the time of the breakout, Illumina boasted a Composite Rating of 98; an Earnings Per Share Rating of 96; a Relative Price Strength Rating of 72; an SMR Rating of A; and an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+. By the end of the month, it was a member of the IBD 50.

  

The breakout from the cup base in early April worked well because it was a breakout from a first-stage base. A lot of sellers had been shaken out of the stock in prior months, making it easier for buyers to regain control.

  

Two flat bases with tight trading followed after that **(1)**.

  

Institutional selling hit the stock in February and March 2014, giving investors with profitable positions a chance to take solid profits **(2)**.

  

Illumina's last base breakout was from a cup-with-handle base in June **(3)**. At the time, the buy point was 161.10. Trade has been a bit choppy since then, but Illumina has managed to hold above the buy point and is trading near highs, partly due to three straight quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth. High-quality mutual fund sponsorship hasn't hurt either.

  

A quick reminder on buying breakouts: Remember, they have the best chance of succeeding in the early stages of a market uptrend, not after a big move by the market. That's why breakouts have been challenging lately. Some high-quality growth names have had a hard time making headway, and not only because of a big market rally. In many cases, the stocks have moved a lot too.

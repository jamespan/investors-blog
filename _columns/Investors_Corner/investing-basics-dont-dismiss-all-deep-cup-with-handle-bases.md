Different situations call for different measures — literally. Just imagine the damage done, for instance, to leading growth stocks in the current [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/).


Let's consider [the cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), a VIP of a chart pattern for investors in the best growth stocks.




In roaring bull markets, pick stocks that [form good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) within acceptable guidelines. Stay away from ones that don't. But in nasty corrections or bear markets like the one that began on Feb. 25, some stocks with excellent fundamentals and outstanding institutional sponsorship will form deep bases. (Please see [the Feb. 25 Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) for more background on why IBD downgraded the outlook for stocks ahead of the bear market decline.)


Not all of these should be shunned. Despite correcting more than normal, these deep patterns can still work, particularly when the company's fundamentals and other traits are outstanding.


In the common [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), during an uptrending market the correction from the highest price of the cup to the low should generally not exceed 30% to 33%.


A Successful Deep Cup Base From Zoom Video
------------------------------------------


So, be wary of stocks that form deep patterns when the [market is in a confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). But in down markets, the downdraft could knock stocks by 40%, 50% from their 52-week highs, or even more.



These deep cup-with-handle bases aren't pretty. But you need to take a stock's correction in context with action in the overall market.


Have you seen what **Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) has done lately? It deserves to be named the poster child of the rally among companies benefiting from drastic changes in the way we work, live and play since the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic on March 11.


On Feb. 20, just days before the [IBD outlook on stocks](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) darkened to "uptrend under pressure" (Feb. 24) and then "market in correction" on Feb. 25, Zoom shares surged past a 107.44 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a very large, super-deep cup base. The San Jose, Calif., firm has powered more than 53% higher since then.


From a then-all-time high of 107.34, Zoom skidded more than 43% lower to 60.97, the lowest intraday price inside that cup.


As noted on [prior shows on IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958), Zoom Video also flashed some early [valid buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/), including a 93.40 entry from a [narrow handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) that could only be seen on a daily chart, not a weekly one.


Understand The Decline By Comparing It With The Stock Market
------------------------------------------------------------


Most stocks tend to be more volatile than the general market or a market index such as the S&P 500. Growth stocks, such as those featured in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) or [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), can correct 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the general market.


So if the market falls 20% to 25% from its 52-week or all-time high, you can easily see a leader get cut in half or more.

From its October 2007 peak to its March 2009 low, the Nasdaq plunged 56%. During this time, a barrage of highly rated stocks carved out deep bases and still went on to become big winners.


**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) plummeted 74% from its May 2008 high to its December 2008 trough. It eventually recovered and cleared a deep cup-with-handle base in the week ended July 17, 2009. It doubled in eight months. (You can see a historical daily, weekly or monthly chart of Baidu via the [IBD premium charting service](https://marketsmith.investors.com), MarketSmith.)



Tech icon **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) soured 60% from its May 2008 peak to its January 2009 low. It broke out in May of 2009 and climbed nearly 60% in five months.


These were abnormal declines, but they were a function of the severe bear market at the time.


During the 1990-91 bear market, the S&P 500 dropped 20% while the Nasdaq tumbled 31%.


How To Trade Stocks: A Great Deep Cup With Handle

Gaming equipment maker **International Game Technology** ([IGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGT)), meanwhile, had a more drastic correction. The stock dived 56% from its July 1990 peak of 20.25 to its October low of 9 **(1)**.


International Game rebounded and formed a V-shaped cup-with-handle base with a 16.60 buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in July 1990). The handle corrected 18% — a tad deeper than normal, but much milder than the decline within the cup.


The stock had good IBD Ratings: a 73 for EPS and a 94 RS. The company's new microprocessor-based games were red-hot. Shares cleared the handle in the week ended Dec. 21 **(2)** but soon failed **(3)**.


International Game cleared another handle in the week ended Jan. 18, 1991 **(4)**. Shares shot up 180% by May (5) before settling into another consolidation.

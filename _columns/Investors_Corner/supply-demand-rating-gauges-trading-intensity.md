Whether you're looking to purchase a house, car or a stock, it's always helpful to be armed with as much information as possible.


That's why in addition to the key IBD ratings such as EPS, RS, SMR and Accumulation/Distribution, IBD offers investors additional proprietary tools to help gauge potential candidates for their watch list. Today's column focuses on the Supply/Demand Rating, which helps gauge a stock's trading intensity.


This rating compares a stock's volume with its float in order to gauge investor demand. The float is the total amount of publicly owned shares readily available on the open market. To calculate the float, subtract the restricted shares from shares outstanding.


The Supply/Demand Rating ranges from a worst-possible 1 to a best-possible 99. A stock with a 99 Rating makes the top 1% of all stocks; a 1 Rating puts it in the bottom 1%. A high rating indicates big turnover and intense trading.


The Supply/Demand Rating is not a timing indicator. Just because a stock gets a 99 doesn't mean it's a leader or its chart is ripe for a breakout. Since its purpose is to give you a sense of strength behind a breakout or sell-off, the rating could remain high even if a stock is sinking.


It doesn't give direction either, like the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which indicates if there is a lot of buying or selling activity among institutional investors. A stock could carry an E Rating and be seeing a lot of selling, but its Supply/Demand Rating could still be high.


That's why it's crucial to always watch a stock's chart action for red flags. The rating is just one more component of an investor's overall due diligence on a stock.


You can find the Supply/Demand Rating in several places within IBD's print edition and eIBD. It appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the mini charts that run with the daily Stock Spotlight column, as well as the IBD 50 on Mondays and Wednesdays, and Your Weekly Review on Fridays.


Every Thursday, IBD publishes a Top Supply/Demand Companies screen, which list stocks that boast strong fundamentals and meet other proprietary criteria, in addition to high Supply/Demand Ratings. Check the Table of Contents on Page A2 to find out which page the screen is on.


The screen weighs institutional demand for shares by identifying stocks that are displaying unusually heavy trading activity in relation to their share supply.


Last Thursday's IBD had just one stock, **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), with a 96 Supply/Demand Rating, as the market's come off its highs.


Keep in mind that IBD's proprietary ratings are intended to supplement an investor's fundamental and technical research. Let's say you have a handful of IBD 50 leaders on your watch list. If their fundamentals and technicals are equally sound, then you might prefer the stock with a high Supply/Demand Rating.

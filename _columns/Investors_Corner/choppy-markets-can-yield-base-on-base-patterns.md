[How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/739732-how-to-trade-stocks-in-a-tough-market.htm)

Bankers count money. Sleepy people count sheep. Successful investors count bases — even during choppy stock markets — to understand where a good stock is in its current upward move.

A stock goes public, moves sideways for a while and before you know it, it breaks out from a first-stage [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) base. It rallies 20% or more and takes another breather. Soon enough, the stock breaks out from a second-stage base. Another strong 20% rally and a breakout from a third-stage base. And so on.

Breakouts from later-stage bases can work, but after a big price run for a stock, they're definitely more risky.

Note that when a stock clears a first-stage base, rallies less than 20% and forms a new base, the new base is still considered first-stage.

In a volatile market, a stock can form a base-on-base pattern, or a base next to a base. A base-on-base forms above the prior buy point. A base next to a base can form below the prior buy point, but it needs to hold above the low of the prior base. Both bases count as one base.

When a stock breaks out, sometimes it heads significantly lower in price. While doing so, the stock also undercuts the intraday low of the most recently completed base. This move resets the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that selling is intense enough to wipe the slate clean of willing sellers, paving the way for another potential leg up.

**Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) formed a base next to a base when major averages started to weaken in the fall of 2012. The first cup-shaped base corrected 12% and showed a bullish accumulation week in the week ended Nov. 16 **(1)**. The second flat base corrected 8% **(2)**. A breakout soon followed in early January. The breakout stuttered, but the stock never fell more than 4% below the 159.90 entry **(3)**.

At a time when the Nasdaq corrected about 12% off its high, Sherwin-Williams' strength was noteworthy. Keep in mind that it's common for a growth stock to correct as much 1.5 to 2.5 times as much as the broad market. Sherwin-Williams pulled back mostly in line with the market.

It wasn't easy to hold the stock when it started to move sideways in June **(4)**, but Sherwin-Williams held comfortably above the buy point.

And it rewarded patience. In 2013-2014, the stock rose 71% vs. the S&P 500's 44% return.

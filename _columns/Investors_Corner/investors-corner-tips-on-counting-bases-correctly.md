A loaf of bread has a certain shelf life. When you see fuzzy stuff grow, it's past the time for optimal consumption.


Great stocks also have shelf lives. So before you buy any stock, you need to know just where its base is in the game. That is, you need to count bases.


Getting in on the ground floor can put you in position to ride a huge winner. But if you buy a late-stage pattern (generally third or fourth), you take on much more risk.


By that time, the stock has already had a big move, and few fresh buyers remain.


Here are some ground rules for counting bases. First, use weekly IBD Charts. They provide about two years of price data, making it easier to find each base in the stock's major advance.


Second, don't count a base if it forms well below 10 a share. Low-priced issues are usually avoided by institutions.


Third, start counting bases only after a company's fundamentals get up to par. For instance, when a company notches quarterly earnings growth of 25% or more, search for a solid basing pattern.


Fourth, a valid base needs a prior uptrend of 20% to 30% or more.


After a bear market, the stock's latest consolidation becomes the first-stage base.


Remember that bases must meet certain time and price requirements. For example, a square box can be as short as four weeks, but it can correct no more than 15%.


Add-on opportunities such as three-weeks-tight patterns and rebounds off of 10-week lines are not counted as bases.


To move onto the next stage, a stock must break out in volume at least 40% above its daily average and muster a gain of 20% or more from the proper buy point.


If a stock rises less than 20% and forms another base, the entire pattern is deemed a base on base and counts as just one base.


Besides a bear market, a stock can reset its base count if it falls so much that it undercuts the lowest point of a prior base.


**U.S. Global Investors** ([GROW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GROW)) was a huge winner in 2006 and early 2007. The mutual fund manager formed four distinct bases as it gained 260% in 10 months.

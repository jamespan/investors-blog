**How To Spot A Fine Chart:** [Fifth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/609681/201204301622/how-to-spot-a-fine-chart.aspx)

  

Savvy investors know there's no such thing as a sure winner. But they boost their chances of success by looking for stocks in proper bases that show tight price action.

  

Weekly closing prices that vary 1% to 2% from the prior week in a period lasting a of couple weeks or more indicate that the stock may be getting ready to break out.

  

The logic goes as follows:

  

Tight trading over a period of time is a sign that the stock is being supported by institutional investors â€” banks, mutual funds, pension funds and so on.

  

These funds typically buy shares over time, rather than all at once, to avoid running up the share price and to keep a low profile. As interest in the stock builds, the "supply" of shares that investors are eager to sell dwindles. As demand strengthens, the price rises.

  

So it pays to figure out where the big funds are putting their money. Sustained institutional demand typically shows up in patterns marked by low volatility. These include flat bases, handles in cup bases and three-weeks-tight patterns, in which one week's closing price is within 1% to 1.5% of the prior week's close.

  

In addition, the stock's intraday or weekly trading range may narrow and volume will be subdued, indicating high investor conviction as the stock builds its base.

  

Let's look at Australian mining giant **BHP Billiton** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)). The stock began forming a cup with handle in early April 2004 as strong global economic growth was boosting demand for everything from coal to iron ore and oil.

  

The right side of BHP's cup shows four straight weeks in which closing prices varied less than 2% from the prior week's close **(1)** as volume slowly picked up. This was a sign that institutional support was building after the stock had bottomed.

  

Trading in the handle was also tight **(2)**, and volume trailed off as you'd like to see.

  

The stock broke out above a 19.70 buy point from the base on Sept. 21, 2004, **(3)** in volume that was more than four times the stock's average daily turnover. Over the next 18 months, BHP soared 158%, peaking at 50.74.

  

A stock's chart can be found in the [Stock Checkup section at Investors.com](http://research.investors.com/StockCheckup.aspx). In addition to a stock's chart action, its up-down volume ratio and IBD's proprietary Accumulation-Distribution Rating indicate which stocks are attracting institutional demand.

  

While tight trading signals institutional support, weekly swings of 10% to 15% or more in a stock's price may point to a lack of conviction. The result is often a V-shaped base featuring sharp rises and falls, suggesting conflicting views about the stock.

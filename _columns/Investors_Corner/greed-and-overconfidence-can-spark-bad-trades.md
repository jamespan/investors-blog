It's easy to get overly confident in the stock market, especially after a series of winning trades. But the market has a way of knocking overly confident traders back down to earth.

  

Investing can be a humbling experience. Just when you think you've got the market figured out, it has a knack for making you look silly. We've all been there.

  

So it might sound counterintuitive, but keeping your powder dry after you've made big profits in a few stocks is a sound strategy that great investors embrace.

  

Everyone can get good at picking great growth stocks with top fundamentals and bullish charts, but knowing when to stay conservative is another critical skill to possess.

  

In some cases, it makes sense to have aggressive exposure to stocks and ride them higher. But in other cases, it makes sense to scale back when market conditions call for it.

  

The next time you're feeling superbly confident about your stock-picking prowess, keep emotions in check and realize that a losing trade is inevitable at some point. When it happens, learn to step away from the market and embrace the fact that cash is a smart position.

  

Of course, you don't want to be sitting on the sidelines in the early stages of a new bull market, but you don't want to fall prey to the emotions of greed and complacency after big gains. Money-losing trades often follow.

  

Imagine you've made three great stock picks in a row. It wasn't plain luck if you acted soon after the market gave a buy signal with a [follow-through day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735761&sourceid=735764).

  

New leadership was emerging after a correction. You put hard work into the research process. You analyzed the bases fully. Fundamentals were compelling. You timed your buys just as institutional money was flowing in from the sidelines. All the pieces were in place for a profitable trade. There were no shortcuts.

  

All three stocks ran up in price. One gain was taken at 30%, another was locked in at 50%. You let the third one ride because it rose 20% in less than three weeks after the breakout. You locked in a 250% profit 18 months later.

  

After all that, what could happen if you became careless or overconfident?

  

Let's move two years into the bull market. The market gets challenging. Your confidence is still high, but you do less thorough research. You think you see a bullish chart, but you miss a few key flaws in some of the stocks' bases.

  

In the case of another stock, you buy too early, before its base completes. Greed and overconfidence are the culprits.

  

Meanwhile, serious distribution days start to crop up in the major averages. You buy stocks that break out, but they quickly fail. The end result: You take losses of 7%-8% on all of your trades.

  

It's human nature to want action all the time in the stock market, but remember that no one is smarter than the market.

Buying right is important, but it's where you sell that determines your bottom line.

Have you ever heard a speaker or an attendee at an IBD seminar remark that selling a stock is a lot tougher than buying one? Maybe someone said something like that in the bar, at the gym, or during a cocktail party. It's true.

IBD's TAKE: _New IBD readers can quickly improve their results simply by following this [one rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). IBD calls it the golden rule._

Since its founding in 1984, Investor's Business Daily has been on a mission to make its readers more successful in the game of equities. When it comes to selling a stock to cut losses, IBD could not be any clearer. Always exit a stock when it falls 7% to 8% below your purchase price. No ifs, no ands, no buts.  The reason is simple; the stock is simply not behaving how you expected it. Accept the loss quickly, and you save your capital to invest again at a better time or in a better company.
How about when it comes to selling your winners to lock in gains, big or small? IBD categorizes profit-taking sell rules into two types: offense-style (or selling on the way up) and defense-style (when a stock is falling sharply).

Today, we will tackle a defense-style sell signal: locking in profits on the day that a stock makes its biggest single-session point decline during a long advance.

It's nice to be able to sell into strength, but human emotions often get in the way. They make the act of selling more complicated. How do you fight this complexity? You follow more smart, time-tested rules.

Investors need to have a concrete exit strategy, or be resigned to watch hard-earned gains disappear fast. So consider at least selling some shares if your stock suffers its largest one-day point loss since breaking out from a base.

After a long advance of many weeks or months, this negative action often signals that the stock has topped. If accompanied by other signs of weak price action, then you'll have more valid reasons to sell and lock in your profits.

A dramatic single-day point loss tells you two things. First, some large shareholders are unabashedly taking profits. A biggest one-day point loss in above-normal turnover is especially worrisome: This tells you that some institutions, such as mutual funds and hedge funds, are dumping their holdings.

Second, it represents a change in the stock's character. David Landry, an author and money manager, puts it this way: If someone who's usually mean to you suddenly starts treating you really nice, be wary. The change in character may mean that something is up.

On an [IBD chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at Investors.com, if you place your cursor on a specific price bar and then hold down the left button, the exact point change will show up in a small pop-up window. Just make sure you're looking at a daily time frame and not a weekly. You can also do this with [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=MSBigMove&src=A012GE5), which requires a separate subscription.

[The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), [intraday market updates](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) and other columns in IBD will alert you to stocks that have suffered their biggest daily point losses.

**IntercontinentalExchange** ([ICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICE)), nicknamed ICE, cleared an 88.97 buy point in a flat base Nov. 14, 2006 **(1)**. The fast-growing derivatives exchange operator came public just a year earlier. It owned solid IBD Ratings at the time of its breakout, too: Composite 99, Earnings Per Share 96 and Relative Price Strength 97.

By February 2007, the stock had bolted 88%. On Feb. 21, it hit an all-time high intraday **(2)**, but finished little changed as volume grew from the prior session. This marked stalling, or bearish action.

On Feb. 27, ICE gapped down and dived nearly 13 points — the biggest one-day point loss since its Nov. 14 breakout **(3)**. Six sessions later, the stock sliced its 50-day moving average (drawn in red in the chart above) in the heaviest volume since the start of the move **(4)**.

In some cases, a stock will pierce its 50-day line, hover below it for a few days, then rebound higher to resume its climb. When you have a large paper gain in such a stock, you can afford to give it a little more leeway, then decide to hold or fold.

As seen in ICE's chart, the stock attempted a rally the very next day after violating the 50-day moving average, but the rebound fell flat. By March 26, ICE melted to as low as 119.42, 28% below its February peak.

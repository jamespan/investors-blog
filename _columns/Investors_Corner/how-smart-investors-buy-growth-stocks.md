Would you like a good tip on how to find a great stock?


Here you go: Watch how it falls.


Every stock takes a break, even the best ones. But the manner in which it takes a break is worth careful study.


A stingy decline from its highs indicates limited amounts of selling by pensions, mutual funds, banks, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional players. In contrast, a deep drop — think 40% to 50%, or even greater — is a loud warning to stay away. After such a brutal sell-off, a former highflier is less likely to craft a solid new base, produce another powerful breakout, and vault to new highs.


Specifically, how stingy is a "stingy decline"?


Keep this useful rule of thumb: Leading stocks generally fall 1.5 to 2.5 times the decline in the major indexes. So, if the Nasdaq were to make an intermediate correction and fall, say, 12% from its peak, a market leader will likely decline 18% (1.5 times) to 30% (2.5 times) from its own 52-week or all-time high.


That's a normal range of decline in which key chart patterns — such as the cup with handle, saucer and double bottom — form.


Buying off a breakout from such a pattern gives an individual investor a market edge. If the breakout works, the investor makes money immediately. If the pattern is flawed, the breakout will fizzle quickly, giving the astute trader the signal to cut losses fast and search for a better play.


In some cases, a terrific growth stock will fall only a little more than the major indexes, particularly during a bear market. Don't ignore this. It's often a sign of true strength.


Keep in mind that other factors determine whether a stock deserves to go on to a watch list for a potential buy. Fundamentals should remain top-notch. Current earnings estimates should not be showing a dramatic slowdown. The company should innovate with new or better products, not try to simply protect its turf. Its industry or sector should be a market leader, not a follower.


When **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) peaked at 80.75 in July 1990, it slid 37% over the next six weeks **(1)**. That's deep. But the Nasdaq collapsed 31% over roughly the same period as the U.S. economy melted into recession and America and its allies headed into war with Iraq. The software giant went on to finish a long cup with handle, then break out to new highs in January. By January 1992, Microsoft ramped up 160%.

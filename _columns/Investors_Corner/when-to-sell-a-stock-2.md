  Heeding Sell Rules Is Crucial In Weak Stock Market

With the market in correction, selling to take profits and selling to cut losses both are important.


Research-driven rules associated with selling include:


•Selling to lock in a gain after a stock rises 20% to 25%. Most stocks consolidate after such a move.


•Selling to lock in a gain because a stock threatens to cycle into a loss. Tiny profits can add up.


•Selling because the stock is the laggard in your portfolio.


•Selling because the stock is 7% to 8% below the buy point. This should be your worst loss. Be willing to exit earlier if the price-volume action is bad.


How many Big Cap 20 stocks fit the above conditions?


**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) broke past a 203.01 buy point July 18. Four weeks later, the stock hit the 20% level. Taking profit is appropriate here unless the investor is committed to holding through the next base.


Recently, LinkedIn cleared a secondary buy point in a short-stroke pattern.


The short stroke involves a long price bar on the weekly chart, followed by a short price bar. The short bar should not make a new high. The buy point is the high plus 10 cents. In LinkedIn's case, the entry was 238.06, which it cleared Aug. 12 in 25% faster volume.


LinkedIn fell 6.7% below the buy point Friday, which would've chased out many disciplined investors — at least in terms of selling the shares bought at 238.06.


**Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) never hit the 20% profit level. The stock cleared an 847.43 buy point July 5, but there were two problems. The market was in correction, and Priceline's volume 35% below average.


Volume kicked in the next day, but the market was still in correction. The stock was extended by the time the uptrend was confirmed.


A three-weeks-tight offered an entry at 926.50. The stock rose 7% and then reversed lower. Action was bad, a low close and four straight down days. Many investors would've exited, happy to take a small gain.


Only you know the names of the laggard or laggards in your portfolio. **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) might fit the profile. The stock cleared a 133.10 buy point in late July and has made scant progress — essentially moving sideways.


While that in itself isn't a sell signal, keep this in mind: If you are taking a 20% profit in a winning stock, you probably should sell your laggard or laggards at the same time.


You don't want profit-taking to turn your portfolio into a collection of laggards. This is particularly true when the market is struggling.


Few stocks that broke out in the recent uptrend triggered the 7% to 8% sell rule. But investors should watch their stocks carefully.


Besides watching for stocks to sell, an investor should watch for issues setting up in possible bases. **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) has added a handle as it consolidates. The potential entry is 58.21.

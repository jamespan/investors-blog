*Fourth in a series*

  

You hear it all the time: This stock has an amazing dividend, or that one's really cheap (meaning a low P-E ratio).

  

Don't be fooled into putting too much weight on these factors with your stock investing. Successful investors using IBD know not to do so. Instead, they focus on the strength of a company's growth, its institutional sponsorship, its competitive position in the marketplace, and the stock's price action.

  

IBD's Rule No. 4 for investment success is to avoid buying a stock simply because of its dividend or P-E (price-to-earnings) ratio.

  

Certainly, it's worth considering the dividend and P-E ratio when you research a promising issue.

  

But many investors focus far more on such metrics than they should, and you don't want to make that same mistake.

  

IBD's research has found that, over the past 100 years, dividends and P-E ratios have had little predictive value and haven't helped with identifying America's most successful companies.

  

This helps explain why IBD's first three rules for investment success all have to do with strong earnings gains and profit margins â€” as well as why the newspaper has always emphasized looking at stock charts for price and volume clues.

  

The dividend, after all, comes from a company's profits. William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has written that a company can "cut its dividends if its earnings per share are not adequately covering those payouts, leaving you without the income you expected to receive."

  

O'Neil, in his best-seller "How To Make Money In Stocks," also has noted: "Keep in mind that you can lose the amount of a dividend in one or two days' fluctuation in the price of the stock."

  

**Big Growth Spurs Big P-Es**

  

But what about the P-E ratio?

  

A big problem with relying too much on this metric is that it can keep you out of some stocks that are really leading the market.

  

In recent years, stocks such as **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) have been among the market leaders.

  

They sported strong fundamentals, formed sound areas of price consolidation and then motored out of those bases to new highs in convincing turnover.

  

For investors following IBD's rules, it was clear that these issues were basically saying, "Pick me."

  

But many investors following conventional wisdom certainly stayed away at key points because they felt these issues were "too expensive." In other words, the stocks looked promising, but their P-E ratios were higher than these folks wanted them to be.

  

When Priceline cleared a flat base in early January 2011, its P-E ratio of 36 was twice as large as the P-E for the S&P 500. Chipotle, Lululemon and Baidu also had high P-Es, but went on to big rallies.

  

"According to our historical study of all the greatest winning stocks, if you'd been relying on P-E ratios, you would have missed almost every major winner for decades," O'Neil wrote in his book.

  

A low P-E ratio is not something that you should demand from a promising stock.

  

O'Neil has said that, in many cases, a firm's P-E ratio "is probably low because the company's past record is inferior."

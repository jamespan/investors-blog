Big stock-price moves in unusually high volume are important signs, because such moves frequently show a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) or a sell signal. IBD offers a filter precisely for that purpose.




As always, price moves have to be taken in the context of volume. When strong volume accompanies a spike, that is a sign of institutional money coming into the stock. Similarly, when a stock makes a big move down in heavy volume, funds are likely moving out of the stock.


The [IBD Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) brings price action and volume together by listing stocks that are moving up or down in higher volume than average. You can find the list on the home page of [Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/), and it is continually updated throughout the session.


Often, this list will be the first place you find a breakout past a buy point or [a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/).

Recent Stock Movers In The Screen
---------------------------------


On May 23, 2023, **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)) rose on heavy buying volume. It was an important stock to check because shares regained the 99.34 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) of a breakout a few days earlier. The stock closed too extended from a buy zone that goes to 104.30.


Shares spiked over 5% while volume surged over 250% after a strong March-quarter report. The Ireland-based airline reported that sales soared 54% to \$2 billion and overshadowed a loss of 72 cents per share.

Shares are building a cup base with a buy point of 171.99. Shares rose after [strong earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mndy-stock-monday-stock-q12023/) on May 15, 2023. The added gains on May 23 indicate this is a strong leader to watch.


Earnings disappointment moved **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) and **BJ's Wholesale** ([BJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BJ)). Both stocks fell in heavy volume May 23. The action took Zoom below its 50-day moving average — a sell signal.


The on May 24, **Tecnoglass** ([TGLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGLS)) had a huge increase in volume in a sharp price decline. Its chart showed the stock broke below the 50-day moving average, [a sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


The Stocks On the Move list also acts as a market barometer. If the up list is shorter than the down list, that would indicate higher selling pressure and a time to pare down your stock positions.


Note that Stocks On The Move is not restricted to market leaders. Stocks with lower ratings or low liquidity may find a spot on a day they make a big move.

Many workplaces require new hires to go through a trial period before becoming full-time employees. They want to make sure the worker is a good fit before fully committing to that person. Investors should view stocks in a similar manner.

Say you find a stock you really like. Why take a huge stake before it proves its worth?

Instead of putting a lump sum into a single stock, do so in small increments over time, and only if the investment is working in your favor. This can help you avoid committing your funds to a dog.

"You should never get fully invested until you are making a profit and showing some headway with what you own," IBD founder and Chairman [William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) wrote in "The Successful Investor."

## Even In Top Stocks, Start With A Half Position

Let's say you have \$150,000 that you want to invest equally in five stocks. Don't run out and spend \$30,000 to buy shares of each stock. Why not commit half that amount the first time you buy each? If those holdings pan out, you could cost-average up, adding smaller amounts until you reach the full positions.

If you sell your worst performers, you can direct some of that money into your best stocks at ideal buy points. You may find your portfolio whittled down to just a few names. But that's OK. Better to own a few leaders than a mixed bag of stocks.

How should you go about adding to your long-term positions? Conservative investors might try taking half-positions on their first buys. If the stocks go up at least 30% and form [new sound bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), they can take smaller stakes [at the breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

More aggressive players may add a smaller amount as soon as a stock moves up 2% to 3% from their initial purchase price. They could add even fewer shares if the stock advances a little higher. Restrict further buys to a 5% increase from your [initial buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), so you don't risk getting caught in a normal pullback.

## Don't Fight The Market

As always, be sure to keep an eye on the market. Averaging up rarely works during a weak market, since most breakouts and rallies fail during a market correction.

An ideal time to buy stocks: When you see the market follow through. When the Nasdaq confirmed its rally on March 17, 2003, you started seeing stocks with strong fundamentals break out. But if you invested in steps instead of buying full positions on confirmation day, you'd have powder on hand either to add smaller amounts to your winners or to buy other leaders breaking out to new highs in the coming months.

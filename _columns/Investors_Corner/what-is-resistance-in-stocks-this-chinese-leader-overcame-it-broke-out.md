  What Is The Concept Of Resistance In Growth Stocks? These Leaders Overcame It, Broke Out

Resistance and support are technical factors that chart readers use to describe certain trends affecting the price of growth stocks. Resistance holds a stock below a certain level and blocks it from going higher. Support keeps the stock above a certain price, and prevents the stock from breaking down.




Here we will focus on resistance.


Resistance is generally the effect of profit-taking. Institutional investors may be committed to booking profits at a certain level, for instance. Every time the stock reaches that level, sellers step in and overwhelm buying demand, sending the stock price lower.


You can see this again and again in many different ways in stock charts. A stock rally often peaks at a particular level. The stock falls back, then periodically rises to "test resistance" at that level. When sellers step in, the stock generally falls back again into another period of price consolidation.

These Past Winners First Cracked Through Price Resistance
---------------------------------------------------------



**Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) met resistance near the 65 level from January 2014 to March 2016. Large cap leisure play **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)), formerly known as Priceline Group, faced resistance around the 1,375 to 1,475 level for 28 months to July 2016.


But you will find that, once a stock pierces above resistance — especially when the stock has been contained for a long period of time — the release quite often marks a point beyond which sellers step back and unfettered demand drives the beginning of a winning stock rally. In these cases, the points at which the resistance is most likely to be overtaken are often marked by a [buy point.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)


These long periods of stasis, followed by breakouts, are often signature charts for stocks executing turnarounds or which are in a recovering cyclical industry.


Today, Booking is trying to recover from a bearish gap down in price on Nov. 20 following third-quarter results. The stock has a lot of work left in [building a new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Resistance can also occur over shorter periods. Look at **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB))'s struggle in May to July 2017 to [break through the 47 level](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/grubhub-target-raised-as-acquisition-growth-starts-to-take-hold/), or **JPMorgan's** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) ongoing six-month battle to beat resistance just above 94.  ([At MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) you can quickly adjust start and end dates to see historical charts.)


Even **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), in its [eight-week fight](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-on-higher-product-prices/) to gain ground above a 156.75 buy point, demonstrates a form of resistance.


Growth Stocks: A Piece De Resistance In 2017
--------------------------------------------

Sometimes resistance occurs not at a particular price point or range but along an upward or downward sloping trend line. China-based **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) provided a good recent example. The stock peaked at just above 96 in September 2014.


An investor looking at the chart can draw a straight line along subsequent peaks marking resistance near 82 in June 2015 and near 64 in April 2016. It continued with resistance in October 2016 near 57 **(1)** and, finally, around 52 in March 2017 **(2)**.


The final peak began a seven-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-cup-without-handle-base/) with a buy point at 51.94. The stock had climbed 38% before starting the base. Following the trend line down, you can see a 4% pop in rising trade on May 2, as the stock topped the line of resistance.


The stock gathered momentum in a four-day run that broke past the buy point and left the stock up 5% in strong trade for the week ended May 12. After the breakout, resistance was eliminated and YY's [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-add-the-10-week-pullback-to-your-playbook/) became a clear touchstone of support, cradling the stock's run.


By January 2018, YY shares soared 175% to a peak of 142.97 before going into a new major correction.

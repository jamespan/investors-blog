Through Thursday, the S&P 500 was down 6.1% since the start of the year and a steeper 10.2% below its all-time high of 6147.43. There is no way of telling when the stock market will turn around. But there are tools to remain prepared. Investor's Business Daily's "[Your Weekly Review](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/your-weekly-review/)" offers some clues. It's found in the Stock Lists tab along the top of Investors.com.


The list holds industry group leaders that meet high standards for earnings and price performance. These stocks each hold an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) and [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 85 or higher.




When several stocks from the same industry group flock, that is a telling sign of strength in that group. Once you see that kind of broader strength, look for stocks that are setting up in bases using chart tools on [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).


Stock Market: Gold and Insurance Stocks In Review
-------------------------------------------------


Several gold and insurance stocks are finding a spot in the list.


In the gold mining group, **Alamos Gold** ([AGI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGI)), **Gold Fields** ([GFI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GFI)) and **DRDGold** ([DRD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRD)) are all extended from buy points. **Harmony Gold** ([HMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HMY)) is approaching a buy point of 12.49 after pulling back to the [50-day moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/)


**Kinross Gold** ([KGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KGC)) is at the top of a buy zone from a buy point of 10.82.


The group recently ranked 11th among IBD's 197 industry groups after moving swiftly up from 54th place six weeks ago.

When a stock in Your Weekly Review is also found in other elite stock lists, that is an added confirmation of its leadership. Take **Agnico-Eagle Mines** ([AEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEM)). The gold producer was added to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Jan. 21. It was also Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).


Agnico just recently cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 101.45 entry, giving current holders an opportunity to add to their position.



Insurance stocks are also outperforming in spades. Dow Jones leader **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)) and **Palomar Holdings** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)) are in Your Weekly Review, as well as insurance brokers **Gallagher** ([AJG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AJG)), **Brown and Brown** ([BRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRO)) and **Ryan Specialty** ([RYAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAN)).


TRV stock is in a base with a buy point of 269.56. The [blue dot](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsurge/) on IBD MarketSurge shows that its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20the%20relative%20strength,with%20the%20Relative%20Strength%20Rating.) is at a new high.


Health Care Stocks
------------------


A few biotechs are also in Your Weekly Review, including **Halozyme Therapeutics** ([HALO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HALO)), **Catalyst Pharma** ([CRPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRPX)) and **Alkermes** ([ALKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALKS)).


Your Weekly Review is a good go-to place for actively managing watchlists since much of the screening is already done for you. The default sort is by the industry group ranking. But it is also possible to sort the screen by price and volume changes as well as changes in earnings per share and sales in the most recent quarter.


The screen also has short cuts to other important screening tools that you can find on [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


Stocks trading below $10 are excluded as are stocks with thin trading volume. The list also weeds out stocks that are more than 15% off their 52-week highs.

  Stock Buybacks May Reveal Positive Clues About Firm

Investors prefer to take a stake in a business venture they strongly believe can succeed. Companies with faith in their future often do the same — in the form of stock buybacks.




In order to buy back stock, a firm must have the cash on hand, which indicates strong cash flow. It also shows the firm is willing to reinvest in its own business.


All positive signs, but don't use buybacks as your No. 1 factor for picking stocks.


First make sure a stock boasts strong fundamentals, belongs to a leading industry group and meets all your other buy criteria. Study daily and weekly charts to track positive price-and-volume action and find stocks building bases.


Like A Bonus
------------


Then, if one of the firms you're tracking announces a buyback of, say, 5% to 10% of its outstanding shares, you can add another reason you like the stock. It's like a bonus — not the overriding factor whether you should buy a stock.


"This reduces the number of shares in the marketplace and usually implies the company expects improved sales and earnings in the future," William O'Neil, IBD founder and chairman, wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


On Page 424 of the book's updated fourth edition, O'Neil lists key guidelines to keep in mind when seeking stocks to buy or add to a watch list. Buybacks are No. 22 on the list.


A company often plans to buy back shares to help boost its bottom line. To calculate earnings per share, you divide net income by the number of shares out. Buying back shares reduces the denominator, which in turn raises the EPS.


Alternative To Buybacks
-----------------------


Why don't all firms do buybacks?


Some tech companies may prefer to spend the cash on research and development instead. A hot new product or service can also help drive profit, revenue and share price.


If a company that hasn't regularly bought back shares starts to do so, take a deeper look. There could be new management in place, which may help spawn new ideas or new products (N in CAN SLIM).

  How To Select Growth Stocks: Look For Leaders That Do Not Have A Growing Debt Ratio

Investors researching growth stocks and building watch lists as the market goes back into a [renewed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) should be sure to look at a company's long-term debt-to-equity ratio, also referred to as simply the debt ratio.




The debt ratio is a [fundamental gauge](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/) that tracks the balance of a company's long-term debt vs. its shareholders' equity. IBD calculates the ratio by simply dividing a company's long-term debt (bonds that reach maturity more than one year from now) by average shareholders' equity over the past two years, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage figure. Both raw long-term debt and shareholders equity measures can be found in quarterly 10-Q or annual 10-K regulatory filings.


The [Stock Checkup function at investors.com](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-altria-group-inc-mo.aspx) lists the Debt/Equity ratio for every company in the IBD database. Ratios are also included in [MarketSmith charts,](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) in the left-side data panel accompanying the weekly charts.


Why Care About The Debt Ratio?
------------------------------


Why bother? Because, just like individuals, companies sometimes borrow too much, or fail to manage well the money they have borrowed.

In addition, comparing debt ratios between growth stocks in [a period of rising interest rates](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/jobs-report-wage-growth-9-year-high/) helps determine which companies might face significant increases in their debt-service costs.


"Rule 1 for all competent investors and homeowners is never ever borrow more than you can pay back. Excessive debt hurts all people, companies and governments," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Compare Debt Ratio To ROE, Industry Peers
-----------------------------------------


Companies of the same size with a 25% debt-to-equity ratio vs. a 225% ratio will make very different quarterly and annual interest payments in order to service that debt. Keep in mind that normal debt loads for companies in different industries can be very different. Banks, insurers and equipment leasing firms, for example, all tend to carry high debt ratios as part of their normal financial strategy.


In contrast, debt ratios among software companies and many types of services firms are comparatively low. So, what if three apparently healthy growth stocks all have similar debt ratios? One good way to gauge how well a company is putting its borrowed capital to use is through its [return-on-equity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/return-on-equity-how-efficiently-a-company-puts-capital-to-use/) gauge, or ROE.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ICtableUPDATE081419-300x189.jpg)You'd like to see ROE of at least 17%. A company with a comparatively high debt ratio with ROE of less than 17% could potentially be struggling. A company with moderate or zero long-term debt, but a very high ROE is potentially a keeper. But, again, compare to other companies in the industry to determine what might be normal.


The above table, updated as of Aug. 13, shows companies with very strong Composite Ratings and solid ratios in terms of long-term debt to equity, ROE and pretax margins.


Both [MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks) and [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) feature the SMR Rating, which tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. In general, prefer those stocks with an SMR grade of A or B vs. a C or lower.


Another corroborating measure can be cash on hand. A high debt ratio and low levels of cash, relative to peers, can point to a struggling company.


Is The Company Paying Down, Or Gathering Debt?
----------------------------------------------


Another way to gauge is by tracking changes in debt level over time. A company paying down debt at a steady or rapid pace can be a positive indicator. This is especially true if the company is growing or holding its cash levels steady, and making its debt payments out of cash flow.


Acquisitions can significantly affect debt and cash levels. A company may have borrowed to complete a large acquisition, driving up its debt ratio. Or maybe the company acquired came with a fair amount of pre-existing debt.


These situations can be difficult to gauge, because they depend largely on the future performance of the acquired operations, and on the execution of management in assimilating the two companies.


In this case, past performance may be the best gauge. Look into prior acquisitions made by the company, and how well management did in combining the operations, finding efficiencies and paying down debt.


If all of these factors are moving in a positive direction, they should be accompanied by notable decreases in the debt ratio.

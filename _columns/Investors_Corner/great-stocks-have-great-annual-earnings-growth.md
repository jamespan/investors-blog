  How To Invest: Large Annual Profit Growth Is Crucial

The A in CAN SLIM is a crucial ingredient to any winning stock.

  

The A stands for annual earnings growth, a gauge that is often overlooked or excused in the heat of the moment.

  

The CAN SLIM investment model shows that any stock with annual earnings growth of less than 25% is less likely to become a market leader. And, while 25% EPS growth is the minimum you should look for, don't be afraid to seek even better results.

  

There's nothing to stop you from selecting stocks with a most recent EPS gain of 50%, 100% or 500% — except, of course, for the scarcity of such stocks. But that's the nature of buying the very best stocks. There are but a few of them.

  

A study of the 1980 to 2000 stock market shows that the greatest winners had an average 36% annual EPS growth rate when they started their rallies.

  

Three out of four stocks in that study showed at least some positive annual EPS growth.

  

You also can look for three straight years of rising EPS growth, with an average of at least 25%. Such results often imply that a company is growing fast even if the general economy is slowing down or even in recession.

  

Return on equity is another annual gauge that can be useful. It's related to EPS because it tracks how efficiently the company generates its profit with the resources (such as money) at its disposal.

  

The least you should accept for any stock is an ROE of 17%, although the best will show 25% or more. But below 17%, the stock is generally not top-notch in terms of fundamentals.

  

Let's look at Nov. 15's Leaderboard's Leaders list, a proxy for the top stocks in today's market. The list included two restaurants, a search engine, a car-parts retailer, a credit-card payment network, a maker of all-terrain recreational vehicles, a Web-hosting service provider, a ranch-supplies retailer and the company that brought robotics into the operating room.

  

Each has a unique niche. What can we expect from those companies' three-year earnings performances and ROEs?

  

Eight of these 10 names show outstanding EPS gains, both in the most recent fiscal year and for the three-year average. The average most-recent yearly EPS gain stands at 31.6%. The average three-year growth rate comes in at 28.1%.

  

One name, **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)), doesn't make the grade. How does one explain that?

  

This software firm's three-year EPS growth rate of 14% is inferior. The 14% ROE is shy of the 17% minimum. But recent quarterly growth has been strong and accelerating, which is just as important as its long-term record (read Tuesday's column on the concept of current profit growth). As this column will explain in coming days, Red Hat shows both high relative strength and sponsorship — keys that make up the rest of CAN SLIM.

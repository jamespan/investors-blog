They say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This was certainly the case for investors who took the plunge on e-commerce platform stock **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) when it formed an unsightly consolidation pattern. After breaking out in early 2019, it went on to rack up gains of more than 500%.


The pattern was choppy and did not fit the definition of proper bases, such as the [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) or [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Yet, the pattern had some positive elements and was labeled a "consolidation" in [MarketSurge's pattern recognition](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/) tool. Think of it as a catchall term for appealing chart patterns that don't quite conform to proper base dimensions.




So, what exactly is a "consolidation" pattern? It has to fit within certain criteria. In terms of base depth, the decline can be as much as 50%. Remember, if a decline is 15% or less it is [more likely to be a flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


In terms of time, a consolidation pattern takes at least six weeks to form long and have a maximum length of 65 weeks.


MarketSurge chief Scott St. Clair told Investor's Business Daily that he looks for an alternate entry whenever possible in a chart identified as a consolidation. He pointed out [the handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) as an especially useful tool to find an entry point. A handle needs at least five days to form, but can go on for weeks. The decline from high to low should not exceed 12%.


Nevertheless, the left-side high of the pattern can always be used as a buy point. To do this you simply add 10 cents onto that prior high.


Shopify Stock Surges From Consolidation
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ICshop121420-300x161.jpg)From late July 2018, Shopify stock entered into a long period of consolidation. An early attempt at forming a cup with handle failed. With three main dips, the pattern also was not a double bottom. It continued to whipsaw for months, but the decline from prior highs was a respectable 33%.


In December 2018, it passed its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 176.60 **(1)** as it enjoyed multiple up-weeks in a row. The stock's relative strength line also gave a clue that a price move was underway. It started spiking in late December, and made a new high when the stock broke out, a bullish sign **(2)**.


The breakout was given further momentum in mid-February 2019, after the company reported EPS growth of 73%, which led to buying in above-average volume. The stock ended up trading up for 10 weeks in a row, an impressive achievement.


By the time the stock started to form what would become its next base in late August 2019, Shopify had turned in an impressive gain of almost 236%. Continued strong earnings aided the stock's progress. Those who chose to stand by the stock, holding it up to the current day, have made a handsome gain of more than 500%.

"The best defense is a good offense" doesn't just apply to football, war or a game of "Risk." It applies to investing, too.


Even the strongest stocks can get knocked down by a choppy market. That's why it's important not just to adhere to strict buy and [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/), but also to tighten them if need be.


The market could be in the midst of a bullish uptrend, but if you don't pay attention to distribution days, that could quickly change. A [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) occurs when the Nasdaq or S&P 500 drops 0.2% or more in heavier volume vs. the prior session. That implies a high level of selling by institutional investors.


By itself, a distribution day or two spread out during an uptrend isn't a big deal. But if they begin to occur more frequently — usually a cluster of five or more in several weeks — it may be time to get defensive by locking in profits and cutting losses short.


That means investors should cut their losses even shorter than normal, selling at a loss of 2.5% to 3% instead of the usual 7% to 8%. In such an uncertain market, it also makes sense to take profits at 5% to 10% instead of holding out for the typical 20% profit that most leading stocks can produce from buy points.


After a late-June to early-August run-up, the Nasdaq suffered its third day of heavy selling on Aug. 2, giving up 0.9% in rising turnover. The next week, it eked out a 0.2% gain and closed in the lower half of its intraday range, a stalling day, which is a type of distribution that sometimes happens when an index closes low in its daily price range. On Aug. 16, the Nasdaq gave up 0.7% to add another distribution day. And on Aug. 24, it fell 0.8% in heavier trade.

IBD downgraded its market outlook to "Uptrend under pressure" that day, indicating that risk was higher and investors should pare their exposure.


**Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) gained 8% from a June 6 breakout from a cup with handle before heading south in early August. On Aug. 23, the stock slipped below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) **(1),** but in lower-than-usual trade. So it didn't trigger a sell signal — yet.

But the market outlook was changed to "Uptrend under pressure" the next session. On Sept. 9, shares fell more than 3% below the 51.41 (split-adjusted) buy point **(2)**. Volume was only about average. But with the market racking up distribution days, it would have been prudent to sell when the loss was smaller than 7%.


Monster has only sunk further since and is now well below the buy point.

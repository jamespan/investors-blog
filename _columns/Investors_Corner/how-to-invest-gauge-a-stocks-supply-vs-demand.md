And now we turn to "S."

The current Investor's Corner series covering IBD's investing strategy has reached its midpoint: the S in CAN SLIM.

It stands for "supply and demand," meaning investors should keep in mind the number of shares available for any company â€” and how great the demand is for those shares.

In the stock market, the laws of supply and demand rule. So when there's big demand for a stock, but few shareholders are willing to sell, this environment of limited supply helps fuels a stock's big move up.

You also need to know whether you're buying a steady, large-capitalization stock or a volatile, thinly traded issue.

Examples of the big "Steady Eddies," so to speak, would be drug developer **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and fast-food giant **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)).

Such big caps generally have been around for decades and rarely make big swings. That limits your downside risk to a degree.

Yet the growth of the market and the fund industry has made it possible for those stocks with a market cap well north of \$10 billion to also make big moves in price.

On the other end of the spectrum, small caps can make huge advances, but also can stage dramatic retreats. The stocks in this category would include recent IPOs like **Fusion-io** ([FIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIO)) and **Jinko Solar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)).

It can be a smart strategy to build a portfolio with a blend of big caps and small caps, so that you're exposed to some steadiness but also some potential big winners.

Note, however, that there are times when the market favors one end of the spectrum, then switches to the other end. IBD's Big-Cap Growth Funds Vs. Small-Cap Growth Funds graph, today on page A17, shows this.

With big caps, don't settle for mammoth companies being run by "caretaker" management. Such leaders are lacking imagination or less willing to innovate.

With small caps, don't go too small, which generally means stocks that trade fewer than 400,000 shares a day.

Issues with an average daily volume below that level typically aren't truly of institutional quality. Most U.S. mutual and hedge funds don't have the space to dive in. You sometimes can make allowances for stocks that are close to that threshold, since they might soon pass it and never look back as interest picks up.

Now let's switch to talking about demand. The main thing is you want to see strong demand at key points in a stock's trading cycle.

When a stock tops a buy point from its latest consolidation, you want to see convincing demand for shares.

That'll show up in the stock's daily and weekly volume totals. You generally want to see daily trade that's at least 40% above its average over the past 50 days as a stock breaks out. Use Investors.com to monitor intraday volume changes. You also prefer to see above-average or at least increasing weekly trade.

Leading stocks often draw even stronger turnover as they break out, attracting trade that's 100% or 200% above normal. **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) did exactly that with its breakout beyond a 428.20 flat-base buy point Jan. 5. Volume surged 129% beyond average.

IBD offers additional tools to help gauge demand, such as the Accumulation/Distribution Rating and the up/down volume ratio. Go to Investor's Corner archives for stories on these topics.

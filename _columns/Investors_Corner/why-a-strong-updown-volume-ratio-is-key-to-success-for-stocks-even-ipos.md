New stock investors may not have heard of the up/down volume ratio before. Why get to know it? This easy-to-use tool helps with the selection of great stocks — even new IPOs.




You can find the up/down volume ratio in the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) feature at Investors.com (see the "Technical Performance" section), in [MarketSmith weekly charts](https://marketsmith.investors.com), and on [Leaderboard charts](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


Buying shares in recently launched initial public offerings can bring big rewards. (See this [IBD Weekly story on IPOs in 2018](https://www.investors.com/news/ipo-stocks-2018/) for the latest evidence.) Yet investors should resist the temptation to buy shares right after a stock goes public.


IPO Bases And The Up/Down Volume Ratio
--------------------------------------


They can be volatile in the first days or weeks of trading. Brand-new IPOs simply haven't developed a trading range in which [a potential base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) may emerge.

Instead, it's best to wait for the stock to settle down and [form an IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), which usually takes two to five weeks to form.


They may look like conventional bases, such as the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) or the [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). They may share characteristics that indicate strong underlying demand. Yet IPO bases tend to be shorter in length.



Roll the clock back more than 14 years. That's when internet search giant **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) cleared a 113.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of an IPO base in late 2004.


The base took just 15 trading days to form. The mild decline of 13% from the base's high of 113.48 to a low of 98.94 showed that big fund managers hardly desired to exit the stock.


Up/Down Volume Ratio At The Breakout
------------------------------------


Look for stocks that are rising in heavy trade and [clearing their buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in volume at least 40% to 50% above the 50-day average. But few new issues have established a long enough track record to even make that judgment, since the 50-day moving average needs, of course, 50 trading sessions to plot on a chart.


Instead, use the stock's up/down volume ratio, which compares the total amount of volume during up days in price vs. down days within the past 50 trading sessions. This time frame is significantly shorter than the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which covers 65 days, or about 13 weeks.


For a new IPO, the range of time covered will be even less than 50 trading sessions, or roughly 2-1/2 months' worth of trading.


Look for stocks that have an up/down volume ratio of 1.5 or better when they clear an IPO base. Readings above 1.0 indicate that volume on the upside is higher than on the downside. So a reading of 1.5 is strong.


Google Stock And Its Up/Down Volume Ratio

When Alphabet, known back then as Google, broke out of its [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) on Sept. 15, 2004, its up/down volume ratio was a whopping 4.7, indicating that volume on the upside towered over the downside.


In the week before its [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), the ratio was 3.6, also unusually strong. Alphabet soared 318% from its breakout past a 113.58 buy point to a high of 475.11 in the week ended Jan. 13, 2006.


The correction in [IPO bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) can be shallow — less than 20%. In a volatile market, the correction can be much deeper. The buy point in an IPO base is 10 cents above the high on the left side of the pattern.

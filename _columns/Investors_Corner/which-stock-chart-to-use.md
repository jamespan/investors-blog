Daily or weekly stock chart? That sounds like asking for window or aisle seat, smoking or nonsmoking, fries or no fries with that. Investors naturally gravitate to either the weekly or the daily chart in their stock routine.

  

The risk in using only one is that an investor could miss something important.What are some advantages of each chart?

  

Among the weekly chart's strengths :

  

•It covers a longer period than the daily chart, giving a broader perspective. One big psychological benefit: It's easier for shareholders to stay calm when looking at the weekly chart.

  

•Weekly action can smooth out minor noise. If an investor is looking only at [daily charts](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786&nav=IBDUCourse5), it's easy to get too focused on moves in the latest 6-1/2-hour session. Worse yet, if an investor gets too focused on daily charts, many are tempted to "graduate" to intraday charts.

  

If an investor is looking for a way to mess with his or her own mind, intraday charts are it. Short of electric-shock treatments, few things jar the psyche more intensely than intraday charts.

  

•The bullish three-weeks-tight pattern is visible only on the weekly chart.

  

•The bearish railroad-tracks pattern is spotted only on the weekly chart. This is one pattern that an investor can't afford to miss. It usually leads to bad action, sometimes even a gap down.

  

•The bullish short-stroke pattern is seen most easily on the weekly chart.

  

•The bullish high, tight flag is more evident on the weekly than on the daily chart.

  

But weekly charts don't carry every advantage. Among the daily chart's strengths:

  

•Bearish wedging in the handle is often easier to see on the daily chart.

  

•Counting the days to see if a stock triggers the eight-week hold rule is more precise on the daily chart. (Keep in mind that the eight-week hold rule is designed to be used only with high-quality stocks.)

  

•Some investors say that an ascending base is easier to see on the daily chart than on the weekly. MarketSmith's [pattern recognition technology](http://www.marketsmith.com/patternrecognition/) can help an investor spot this pattern.

  

•The daily chart is necessary if an investor is looking for a market [follow-through day](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/706592-how-to-identify-the-start-of-an-uptrend.htm), which confirms that a new uptrend is underway.

  

•A stock's trip to its 50-day moving average can occur before or after its trip to its 10-week line. So, when studying that kind of action, the investor is wise to look at both charts.

  

•Sometimes a base's handle is clearer on the daily chart than on the weekly.

  

In late October to early November last year, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) sketched a handle that was visible only on the daily chart **(1)**.

  

At first glance, the handle might've looked too low for the base, which rested within a larger consolidation. But the math checked out; it passed the midpoint test. The buy point was 77.77.

  

When the stock cleared the buy point, volume was missing. Disciplined investors would not have bought because of the low volume. But big volume kicked in on Nov. 21, giving investors a chance to buy from 1% to just under 3% above the ideal entry **(2)**. From the highest price on Nov. 21 to an intraday high of 99.20 on March 19, the stock gained nearly 28% in four months.

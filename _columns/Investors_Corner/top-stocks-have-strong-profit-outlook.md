  Stocks With Most Potential Have Strong Profit Outlook

While fundamentals drive stock prices, strong full-year profit estimates are another key barometer of a stock's potential. Growth stocks should have an earnings per share growth estimate of at least 15% for the current full year, although a number of leading names are often expected to show year-over-year gains of 25% or more.

  

"The consensus among analysts on what earnings will be for the next year should also be up — the more, the better," IBD founder William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

Estimates can be found throughout IBD — in the Sector Leaders mini charts each day (today on page B1), the [IPO Leaders](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) charts every Tuesday and Thursday, and the IBD 50 every Monday and Wednesday.

  

Annual EPS estimates can also be found at the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) at Investors.com, which provides data such as a stock's three-year EPS growth rate, consecutive years of annual EPS growth and estimated EPS change for the current year. You can also find those figures on various websites, such as Yahoo Finance.

  

IBD research shows that the biggest stock market winners over the past century have sustained strong profit growth for at least three years before beginning their big runs. That's why the A in IBD's [CAN SLIM investment system](http://education.investors.com/) stands for annual earnings. Past winners that met that criteria include **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), Chinese search giant **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and online travel stock **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)).

  

Keeping an eye on companies with strong full-year earnings estimates can alert you to stocks with potential to rise sharply in the future. Some of the best growth stocks eventually post EPS growth of 50%, 100% or more. Yet not all stocks with robust earnings estimates will turn into winners. Companies with strong profit growth outlooks but weak sales forecasts could be cutting costs to boost profits.

  

Shrinking profit margins could mean that the company's products are facing tough competition or its costs are too high.

  

That's why investors should keep an eye on other criteria, such as return on equity of at least 17%, strong and accelerating quarterly earnings and sales growth, and high-quality [institutional sponsorship](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/734297-check-for-institutional-sponsorship.htm).

  

Also be aware of any dramatic deceleration in growth. If a company's EPS increases go from, say, 200% to 80% to 25%, that's a negative. A stock may be ready to correct deeply in price.

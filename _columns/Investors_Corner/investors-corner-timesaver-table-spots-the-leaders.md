Thoughtful investors gladly spend time on their craft.

But they also understand that time, if not carefully managed, can consume other, equally important parts of their lives.

IBD's features aim at efficient time management. The most obvious example: the IBD Timesaver Table. This feature, typically found opposite the International Leaders page, gives a quick snapshot of top-rated stocks making significant moves during the past trading day.

The left side lists the day's winners. The right side provides the notable losers. To qualify for the list, stocks must move at least 1 point in price or make a 52-week high or 52-week low.

Italicized stocks have 80 or higher EPS and RS Ratings, and have gone public within the last 15 years. Boldface stocks meet that 80 EPS-80 RS threshold, plus they gained one point or more for the day, hit new highs or drew daily trade that was at least 50% higher than average.

Have a look at the Timesaver Table following the March 12, 2009, market session. That was the day the NYSE indexes followed through, turning the market toward a fresh bull run.

The Stocks Up list that day showed **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) with a 7% gain. **Green Mountain Coffee Roasters** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) surged 9%. **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) cranked out a 6% advance. This wasn't the best time to jump into these stocks. Netflix posted a brief gain, then slipped into a six-month consolidation before launching into its 540% advance.

But **Computer Programs & Systems** ([CPSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPSI)) also made the list with a 4% gain. It broke out and ran up 60% over the next nine months.

Not all of the stocks on the table will automatically become winners. The March 13 TimeSaver table showed a 5% gain by China's **CNOOC** ([CEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEO)). The stock then plummeted for two weeks.

But your CAN SLIM rules help you navigate toward the winners at the appropriate time.

After the market's recent, Aug. 23 follow-through, TimeSaver showed gold and silver miners, restaurants and a smattering of other well-placed industries leading the day's action. Keep this list handy as the uptrend continues and watch for new breakouts or follow-on buy points to emerge.

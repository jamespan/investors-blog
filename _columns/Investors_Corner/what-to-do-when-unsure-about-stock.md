When an investor weighs buying a stock, he or she is under pressure, even if the market isn't.

Decisions that look easy in hindsight can be tough in real time. Put money at risk, and hope and fear naturally enter the equation.

What looks obvious in hindsight might've been hard to recognize in real time. A base, for example, involves many elements. Most bases aren't perfect. They involve good things and not-so-good things.

How can you know you are weighing every factor correctly?

The short answer: You can't.

Now before you say, "Thanks for nothing" and turn the page, consider this: IBD has three rules to help you avoid a lemon stock, even when your ability to judge the stock correctly is in doubt.

Rule No. 1: Don't buy a stock before the breakout. Yes, you will get a lower price. But there's no guarantee a stock will finish a base and break out. Even if you cut your losses quickly, you can damage a portfolio with repeated small losses.

Rule No. 2: Don't buy a breakout that lacks volume. Sure, upside volume may kick in late but you have no guarantee it will.

Rule No. 3: Avoid stocks breaking out of later-stage bases. You might make an exception for truly exceptional leaders (**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in its prime), but generally late-stage breakouts are trouble.

**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) sketched a base in February 2012, but the stock's overall picture was mixed.

The industry group was strong (28th out of 197 groups). The Accumulation/Distribution Rating was A-. The Composite Rating was 97. ROE was 29%. Recent earnings grew 58% on a 35% sales pop.

A handle had formed that looked more normal than the previous handle. But it was upward-wedging, a flaw. There were more drawbacks. The base was third stage and 42% deep, not ideal. Much of the base formed under the stock's 40-week line.

Consider how IBD's rules could've protected the investor.

The stock cleared the 114.75 entry Feb. 21, 2012, in volume 3% above average. Weekly volume was thin **(1)**. Not a buy. The stock closed above the entry in below-average volume in each of the next five sessions. Not a buy times five. The base was third stage. Not a buy.

Caterpillar rose 2% above the buy point, and then slid 33% in five months. The stock's action around the buy point, coupled with the IBD rules, made hope and fear irrelevant, and the rules did it in real time.

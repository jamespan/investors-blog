Birds fly in flocks. Fish swim in schools. Wolves hunt in packs. Stocks move in industry groups. Hard to believe? Research shows that "37% of a (leading) stock's price movement is directly tied to performance of the industry group," IBD Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

IBD research also shows that another 12% of a winning stock's price move is owing to the industry sector. That means that nearly 50% of a winning stock rally's strength borrows from the stock's industry and economic sector.

  

Industries can also move on economic trends, such as housing and retail gains driven by recovering consumer spending. It may also be a significant structural shift or technical advance within an industry. This might be shale gas and oil development, or advanced safety technology on new automobiles. You can follow industry trends by reading the daily [Industry Themes](http://news.investors.com/investing/ibd-industry-themes.htm) columns in IBD and at Investors.com.

  

The biotech and ethical drug industry has produced a welter of leading stocks in the past year or two. Smaller biomedical firms saw an influx of investment from big pharma as the industry saw a historic lapse of patent protection on aging blockbuster drugs. Larger firms found themselves needing to bulk up to compete. Many seized on overseas acquisitions. Some shifted their headquarters overseas in order to sidestep U.S. tax burdens.

  

When **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) broke out of a four-month cup-base in April 2013, the stock already had been climbing for four years. But Tarrytown, N.Y.-based Regeneron only managed to pull its earnings growth together through 2012.

  

Some of its prior bases were volatile and produced numerous pullbacks. Yet, by April 2013, its Composite and RS ratings were best-possible 99s.

  

The Medical Sector ranked No. 17 among 33 economic sectors tracked by IBD and listed in the daily IBD Smart NYSE & Nasdaq Tables. That was down from a No. 7 position in January.

  

But of the 15 groups within that sector, Medical-Biomed/Biotech ranked No. 14 â€” one of two medical groups within the top 20. IBD's daily Top 40 Groups list on page B2 of the paper showed the group had climbed from a No. 33 group ranking in January, posting a 19% year-to-date gain.

  

Investors who bought at the breakout would have logged a 178% gain through Monday.

The IBD [General Market Indicators](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DailyGMI_070824.pdf) page gives you what you need to know about the stock market in one place.

## An Overview Of The Stock Market

The main part of the page — a link is at the bottom of [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) each day — are charts of the S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average charts. They show [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/), [the 50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and year-to-date performance. Volume helps measure the level of conviction among institutional investors, while moving averages show potential support and resistance levels.

But that's just the start. Overlays provide a deeper look at market conditions.

One way to measure stock market breadth is with the NYSE advance-decline line on the S&P 500 chart. The Nasdaq chart has its own A/D line.

The line plots the difference between the number of advancing versus declining stocks each day. An uptrending line shows positive stock market breadth, and vice versa.

The NYSE A/D line tends to perform better over time. That's because the NYSE's listing requirements are  more stringent, resulting in a set of higher-quality companies.

A declining A/D line while the index is rising should be treated as a red flag. It indicates that fewer stocks are participating in the advance.

## **Put-Call Ratio Can Spot Market Tops, Bottoms**

The put-call volume ratio measures the number of traded put versus call option contracts. A measure above 1.0 indicates more fear among investors because there are more bearish bets being placed. The ratio, plotted below the Nasdaq chart, shows its 12-month high and low for comparisons.

Use this as a contrarian indicator. A ratio above 1.15 indicates excessive fear in the stock market and often occurs when the market bottoms. Readings below 0.5% can indicate investor overconfidence.

The put-call ratio jumped to 1.61 on Dec. 29, around the time the major indexes bottomed. The market had a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) on Jan. 6 that marked a market uptrend.

The ratio plodded along below 1.0 until the banking crisis hit in early March, causing it to spike just as the market hit a low on March 13.

## Accumulation/Distribution Ratings

The major stock market indexes get an IBD [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) similar to stocks. The rating tracks buying (accumulation) and selling (distribution) for the last 13 weeks on a scale from A+ (most buying) through E (most selling).

Within the S&P 500 chart, you'll find a breakdown of most stocks in our database by Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Study the numbers and watch for shifts among the ratings to get a sense of the market's health.

The IBD Mutual Fund Index is the last chart on the General Market Indicators page. The chart, which includes a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/), can serve as an gauge of stock-picking pros. An IBD committee reviews and updates the funds that make up the index periodically.

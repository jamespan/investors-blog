  Why Chasing Hot Tips Doesn't Pay In The Stock Market

Earning a quick buck off a stock tip sounds exciting, but it's no way to make money in the long term. Not only do most tips turn out poorly, but the habit of surrendering investing decisions also stifles an investor's learning curve.

  

Today's column kicks off a brief, informal series in [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) on investor psychology and suggestions on how to break certain mental habits that kill performance.

  

"Many people are too willing to risk their hard-earned money on the basis of what someone else says rather than taking the time to study, learn, and know for sure what they're doing," wrote William O'Neil, founder and chairman of IBD, in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

**Generate Your Own Ideas**

  

Taking tips can be destructive. Successful trading requires a consistent approach to idea generation, portfolio management and general market analysis. But tips add a random element to trading, obscuring responsibility for results and making it a challenge to learn what works and what doesn't in a systematic way.

  

Tips can be someone's hot stock pick "that's sure to double," a Wall Street analyst's opinion, or a guru's prediction of the direction of the whole market.

  

The antidote to tip taking is knowledge.

  

Instead of relying on tips and touts, learn to interpret the daily changes of the general market indexes and the action of leading stocks. "Once you know how to do this correctly, you can stop listening to all the costly, uninformed, personal market opinions of amateurs and professionals alike," wrote O'Neil.

  

Use The [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) and the What's The Market Trend page (today on B2) for essential data and analysis of general market conditions. Carefully review and understand what is happening without trying to predict the future.

  

The only way to use a tip, besides ignoring it, is to check it out for yourself. Run the stock's fundamentals against a [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) checklist and analyze the stock's daily and weekly price charts for a proper base pattern. Check its ratings via [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) to see if it's a leader or a dud.

  

A thorough [checklist](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735773) is like a buzzsaw that will chew through the thousands of inferior stocks in the market. The vast majority will not pass muster and you can simply move on. If the stock is truly outstanding you can add it to your watch list.

  

Even tips from the pros can cause investors grief. In June 2013, **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) broke out past a 107.23 early entry on a high, tight [flag pattern](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/641437-rare-chart-pattern-delivers-big-stock-gains.htm). Shares resumed their explosive advance and climbed over 20% in just 12 trading sessions.

  

The company had only recently reported its first-ever quarterly profit, and both enthusiasm and skepticism were running rampant as shares screamed higher. Just as Tesla started advancing from the buy point, a negative research note from **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) questioned the stock's valuation and sent shares crashing.

  

Investors who were shaken out missed a big run, though, as the innovative car maker turned around and ran up to 194 in 2-1/2 months.

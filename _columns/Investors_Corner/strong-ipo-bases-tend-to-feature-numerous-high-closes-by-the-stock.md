Over a two week period in 2016, IBD shed new light on how to study a brand new base by a brand new stock.




These Investor's Corner stories include a special [8-week holding rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-catch-an-ipo-winner-by-sitting-tight/) for new IPO stocks that clear their first bases and hit new highs; how to capitalize on [long moves](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-a-fast-moving-ipo-after-its-breakout/) following an IPO base breakout; and why the [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/look-for-ipo-stocks-with-strong-updown-volume-ratio/) can help you gauge institutional demand as an initial public offering goes to market and draws a narrow base.


IBD research on thousands of winning stocks over the years validates these articles. And such research often first gets public exposure through special events like the annual [CAN SLIM Masters program](http://shop.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/can-slim-masters-program/?src=ibdevnt), a two-day seminar taught by IBD senior editors and portfolio managers who work for IBD's sister firm, O'Neil Data Systems.


CAN SLIM works. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) found that from January 1998 to December 2014, the CAN SLIM method produced an average annual return of 25.1%, vs. 4.5% for the S&P 500. To achieve [CAN SLIM mastery](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749), continue to read key articles and analyze the charts seen throughout the newspaper and on Investors.com. Apply the principles. Reread the Investor's Corner articles to fully understand the concepts. Cut out the articles and keep them in a scrapbook.

CLOSE




Today, we address the key element of "high closes" on a weekly chart.


A high close is simply when the stock finishes well within the upper half of its weekly trading range. So if a stock traded as low as 50 and as high as 55 during the week, a weekly close of 54 is excellent. It means that fund managers were eager to bid up the stock, while other deep-pocketed players were reluctant to sell.


When demand is high and supply is relatively low, that becomes apparent when you are seeing a multiple number of high weekly closes. **ARM Holdings**debuted on the Nasdaq in April 1998 and doubled in three months.


That's a nice uptrend you'd like to see before a stock creates its first base pattern. The British designer of mixed-signal semiconductors, which traded under the ticker "ARMH," formed a terrific four-month [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).![ICch-ARMH-040816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ICch-ARMH-040816.jpg)


The 36% decline from head to toe was a tad deep. Yet on the left side of the fairly symmetrical pattern, ARM finished in the upper half of its weekly range in four separate weeks, including a 22% surge in the week ended Aug. 21 **(1)** amid the steep bear market ushered in by Japan's financial mayhem, the collapse of Long Term Capital Management's hedge fund, and Russia's debt default. In the week ended Oct. 9, near the stock market bottom, ARM rose 14%.


Volume grew 28% above its 10-week average **(2)**, another hint of strong demand.


On the cup's right side, ARM posted high closes nearly seven weeks in a row **(3)**. A Dec. 8 breakout past a 58.10 buy point (chart shows prices adjusted for a 4-for-1 split in April 1999) unleashed a 1,311% gain through the end of 1999.

ARM Holdings was acquired by Softbank in July 2016. Please follow Chung on Twitter at [@SaitoChung](https://twitter.com/SaitoChung) and @IBD\_DChung for more on growth stocks, buy points, sell rules, breakouts, chart analysis and stock market insight.*

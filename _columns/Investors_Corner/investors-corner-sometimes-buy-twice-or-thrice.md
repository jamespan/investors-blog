Remember the days at the carnival shooting gallery? Rifle in hand, you might have fired a cork at the floating ghost and missed.

  

Did you give up and move on to the bandit behind the barrel? Of course not. You aimed at the ghost and fired again.

  

It takes courage to pull the "buy trigger" when a stock with leadership credentials jumps out of a solid base. But as many IBD readers know all too well, some initial breakouts are head fakes. We miss.

  

Don't automatically brand the stock a failure. The true rally might kick in on the second or third try.

  

This is the time for real courage.

  

Some great stocks pull back days or weeks after rising past the proper buy point. Shakeouts happen. Why? A fragile follow-through falls apart. The stock's base is not as sturdy as it first seemed. A profit warning or a natural disaster can briefly hobble a stock.

  

If the stock has truly great fundamentals, consider taking a slightly bigger stake on the second buy attempt. This technique might make you feel you are maintaining some degree of control of the situation.

  

**Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) has been a fine big-cap leader in the past few years. But the road to success for investors has had its share of potholes.

  

Take its breakout from an unusual base in the week ended July 23. **1** A July 7 follow-through by the NYSE composite gave investors confidence in buying the breakout.

  

But after two weeks of mild gains, Deere slipped, falling 3 points below its 63.78 buy point. It didn't fall enough to trigger the 8% sell rule. Still, given the heavy trade in some down days and the market's weakness in August, bailing out would have made perfect sense.

  

September, however, was a new month. The indexes followed through on Sept. 1. Meanwhile, Deere found its legs again. Not only did it post a good reversal in heavy volume in late August, but the stock found support at its 10-week moving average two weeks in a row. **2** The message? Buy it back.

  

Deere had just reported a 45% jump in Q3 earnings on a 16% increase in sales â€” the best result in 10 quarters. What if you missed this buy point? The second pullback to the 10-week line in October gave a new opportunity. **3** The stock's heavy-volume price drop stopped dead at this support line.

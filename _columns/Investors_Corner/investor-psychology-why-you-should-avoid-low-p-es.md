*Fifth In A Series*

  

Stocks are like motorcycles. The best ones are expensive.

  

If you have your heart set on a brand-new Triumph Bonneville, expect to pay more than for, say a lesser bike from a company you've never heard of.

  

Your portfolio deserves the best stocks, just as you deserve the best motorcycle. That's why you must break the instinct to find the bargain. Buy the best, and expect to pay more.

  

Let's examine two ways the market values a stock: price and the price-to-earnings (P-E) ratio.

  

You should not be afraid to buy a stock as it breaks out, even though you'll be paying more than almost anyone else had ever paid up to that point.

  

But if a great stock is going to break out at say, 30, and rise to 100, it's going to have to start its move at 31, even if that's a new high in price.

  

You may well be the first person ever to pay 31 for that stock. That's what a breakout is all about. Hopefully, you won't hold that honor for long.

  

Now consider the P-E ratio, another way investors like to see if a stock is "cheap" or "expensive."

  

It's derived by dividing the stock's price by its total EPS over the past 12 months. This tells you how many dollars the market is willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. A forward P-E takes EPS expected one year out.

  

You may have been taught to find stocks with low P-E ratios relative to other companies in the same industry or even compared to the broad market. That's a great way to avoid buying the very stocks you really want to own.

  

Do you think **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) or **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) or **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) showed a P-E ratio of seven before the launch of their big moves? Certainly not.

  

It's always tempting to pick up some shares of a mediocre company that perhaps had sold off too much, too soon. But they aren't guaranteed to rise. In fact, they may be stocks headed for disaster.

  

Even apart from the doomsday-scenario stocks, what sort of portfolio could you build by focusing on the bargain stocks? Maybe some good dividend stocks, but mostly a lot of rust-bucket, second- or third-tier companies.

  

A study of the stock market from 1953 through 1985 shows that, on average, quality stocks showed a P-E ratio of 20 as they first broke out from an early-stage base. The average P-E for the Dow Jones industrial average was 15 at that time.

  

That same study also showed that the real winners were able to increase their P-E ratios by 125%.

  

This may help you set a target price for a great stock. As it breaks out from its first base, look at the current P-E ratio and multiply it by 2.25. Multiply that expanded P-E by the stock's EPS estimate two years out. That will give you an idea of how far this stock can go.

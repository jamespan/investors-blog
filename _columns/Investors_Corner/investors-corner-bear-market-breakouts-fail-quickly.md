The big money is usually made in the first two years of a bull market.

  

IBD has often made this point, but it's worth repeating given the market's current state.

  

What's that state?

  

Stocks are now more than two years beyond March 2009, the month when they picked themselves up and started a strong rally.

  

The major indexes are well off highs that they hit in early May.

  

And IBD's outlook had been "market in correction" for weeks until Tuesday.

  

In other words — and if history is any guide — this seems like the type of period when it will be tough to make money.

  

You still might see some stocks break out of consolidations, but you ought to keep in mind that these issues could face resistance.

  

You want to swim with the current when you take a dip, rather than against it. As longtime IBD readers know, the "M" in the CAN SLIM investing strategy stands for Market, meaning it's essential to stay in sync with the general market.

  

Buying breakouts when the market is against you rarely ends well.

  

Let's take a look at a breakout that fizzled after taking place at the end of a bull market.

  

**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), the business software giant, provides a good example of exactly that turn of events.

  

In the summer of 2000, the stock formed a cup with a faulty upward-drifting handle **1**. The breakout past 43.51, 10 cents above the handle's high, came in late August. The stock hit new highs for a couple days **2**.

  

But the move showed other flaws. For starters, it lacked convincing turnover. Volume stayed below average **3**. It only ramped up as the stock retreated from its early September peak.

  

Another problem was that Oracle was attempting to break out at the end of a powerful bull market. It had already joined in a strong rally, and it was trying to keep that going. Unfortunately, the tech bubble had already burst.

  

IBD-style investors would have ended up selling the stock and cutting losses as it sliced through its 10-week moving average in strong trade during the week ended Sept. 15, 2000 **4**. Oracle ended up tumbling as much as 84% from its peak at 46.47, falling as low as 7.25 in June 2002.

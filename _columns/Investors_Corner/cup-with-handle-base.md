The cup-with-handle base is the most commonly found of all the recognized base patterns. It's the classic. Learn to spot it on a chart, and — crucially — learn to spot fatal flaws.

To know what's wrong you first must know what's right. Let's look at the individual elements of a cup-with-handle base.

• The Cup: This is the story of a stock that had been rising (any base needs at least a 30% prior uptrend), settled back between 12% and 33% (30% would be nicer than 33%), found support and started to move up again. This process should take at least six weeks.

Now for the particulars: The cup should be symmetrical. The left-side decline and the right-side incline should look similar, and they shouldn't look too steep.

Volume at the bottom of the cup should be tame, although a high-volume upside reversal (the stock dives, then claws back to finish in the upper 60% of the day's range) is always nice to see.

Volume can pick up on the right side, but you don't need a mad scramble for shares — yet.

• The Handle: Look for an appendage hanging off the cup's right side. It should be at least five days long, and drop 8% to 12% — less is OK, more is a problem. Also, the handle should appear in the upper half of the base. (Add the cup's top and bottom, divide by two. Do the same for the handle. If the handle's midpoint is lower than the cup's, you're looking at a serious flaw.)

Volume should be low. This is a stock's quiet period. It failed in its stab to reach new highs. That's how the cup formed in the first place. Now, impatient longs unload into smart, patient hands. That's the handle. Those smart hands don't want to attract attention. It's like fishing: Make too much noise and the fish will scurry away.

The handle should slope downward. Sideways may be OK, but an upward-sloping handle is a fatal flaw. The handle is a quiet shakeout pattern. If it's wedging higher, only a few people are getting in, not out.

**Panera Bread** ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) built a four-month cup in early 2009, followed by a handle that ran a few more weeks. The cup was imperfect, showing a steady decline on the left side but a sharp incline on the right side. That's clearly asymmetrical. Worse, though, was the wedging handle that appeared March 26 through April 15.

Panera broke out on the upside, but a small advance was followed by a nasty decline.

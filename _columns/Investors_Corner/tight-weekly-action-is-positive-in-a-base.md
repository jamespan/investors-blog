Big swings are good in baseball and ballroom dancing.

But when a stock is building a base, you'd like to see wild weekly price swings — anything more than 10% from the week's low to its high — kept to a minimum.

The reason: Tight closes and modest weekly swings suggest serious institutional interest in a stock. How so? When just a small pack of investors are buying, demand for a stock is likely uneven. Prices are more likely to swing wild.

When the big boys are buying, sellers and market makers are much more likely to find steady, patient demand.

**Meaningful Support**

When the big money funds go long, they slowly build big positions. They cannot just snap up 5 million, 10 million or 50 million shares of a stock. They have to accumulate their holdings gradually over time. They tend to do this in an organized fashion. The funds stop buying when a price gets too high, then step back in to buy when shares dip to set levels. This approach leads to tight weekly price action within a good base.

Funds' trading desks often hover with bid orders just below the market to catch what shares fall their way. Small price increases may coax small-time investors to give up shares. Big funds are more patient. When the price rises, they usually refrain from buying.

That kind of accumulation appears on the chart as tight trading. These are the fingerprints of big funds.

Another fingerprint: price swings that become wild and frequent after a long run-up. This often signals fund managers shifting from net buying to net selling.

This is one reason why late-stage bases tend to be wide and loose, and thus fail.

**AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) had just shifted out of a period of wide, loose weeks when it started shaping a prim and proper saucer with handle in May 2009. Shares climbed more than 100% before starting the base, a good sign.

Before the base formed, weekly swings ranged as wide as 28% in the three months through December 2008 **1**, then began to settle. In the 36-week cup, only one week ranged as wide as 11% **2**.

Things cinched up even tighter in the six-week handle. The stock climbed above the 161.43 buy point Feb. 16. Trade was moderately above average, and over time the stock amassed more up weeks in higher volume. It rose 71% over the next 10 months.

**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

A market that curves sharply lower is no place to be trapped while holding onto losses, waiting to see whether a wounded stock can get back up on its feet. A sure way to avoid such a predicament: Cut your losses short — even shorter than 7% or 8%. Take action in this important situation when a stock falters during a breakout attempt.

  

Stocks often pull back to retest buy points. Or they will test support at a 10-week moving average that is sometimes just below a buy point.

  

In a bad market, some stocks quickly reverse after a breakout try and dive into corrections that last months or even longer.

  

In other cases, the stock's recent base is flawed and the breakout fails quickly, even in a [good market](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx), come in mighty handy.

  

And if breakouts fail in a market that is correcting or under pressure, selling before 7% to 8% is often a smart strategy. Cutting your losses at 3% to 4% — or getting out at break-even — when the action is clearly negative is smart trading.

  

Case in point: Bombay-based **Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)). The automaker has had a tough slog turning around a sales slump in India, but its Jaguar and Land Rover nameplates — acquired from **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) in 2008 — have driven sales and profit overseas.

  

The stock started this year in a four-month double-bottom base showing a 48.28 buy point. On the Jan. 22 breakout, it surged 4% in heavy volume. Great start.

  

U.S. markets hadn't begun their long, rangebound nap. However, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were mildly off their December highs and struggled to regain their 50-day moving averages.

  

In India, the Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark, the Sensex, peaked on Jan. 29, then fell into a steep, six-day dive.

  

On Feb. 3, the stock nicked a new high of 51.80, 7% above the buy point. That's not much of a profit cushion. But it put Tata above the permissible buy range.

  

U.S. markets had begun to turn up, retaking 50-day support with two days of sharp gains in rising trade.

  

Tata then backed off even as U.S. markets rose, narrowly undercutting the buy point and retesting its 50-day line twice **(1)**.

  

That divergence was unsettling.

  

When the stock did cut its 50-day line March 10-11 **(2)**, it did so in light trade.

  

Still, Tata was less than 4% below the buy point. This was the time to set an early sell point in case the stock unraveled further.

  

More red flags started to rise as shares met resistance in retaking the 50-day line.

  

The Sensex was failing a battle with resistance at its own 50-day moving average.

  

When Tata fell 2% on March 24, the jump in volume was a sell cue **(3)**. The Sensex continued to back off and the S&P 500 was also down for a second straight day, helping corroborate the sell signal. Today, Tata is below 32, 35% below the 48.28 buy point.

The 50-day moving average on the daily chart, or the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) on the weekly chart, is a handy and necessary indicator of stock movement. It can be used to buy stocks after they've advanced from their primary breakouts.


Think of it as a second chance to buy a great stock, or to add more shares if you already bought it.




The line is nothing but a simple average of a stock's closing price over the 50 most recent sessions. But it bears vital signals for those studying stock charts.


The [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) is useful for both buy and sell signals. When a stock rebounds from the line after a breakout from a base, it can provide the next chance to catch the stock's run.


Buying On Pullbacks And Rebounds
--------------------------------


Here are some guidelines on using this buying strategy:


* The first and second rebounds from the line work best.
* Volume should be light as the stock pulls back to the line and heavier as it rebound from it. The lighter pullback shakes off sellers and allows new buyers to take the stock higher.
* When the 50-day line is below the buy point in the base, that is not a time to stock up. That's a technique to average down rather than use a time-tested method such as [pyramiding into a larger position](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-pyramid-into-a-winning-position/).
* Support at the line offers a chance to add to an existing position after a stock has broken out of [a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/). It shows that the stock has tested the key support level after a breakout.
* A rebound from the line after a breakout is also a good second chance to make an initial purchase of the stock.
* The buy zone starts with the bounce off the 10-week average and at a short-term resistance level. It could even be the prior week's high, or another prior high that's near the 10-week line. Avoid buying more than 5% above the 10-week average. So the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) is similar to what's used in base breakouts.

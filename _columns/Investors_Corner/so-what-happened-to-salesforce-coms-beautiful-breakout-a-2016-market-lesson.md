Advanced chart readers who use IBD often pay extra attention to the stock that has the rare power to stage the breakaway gap.

All fine, all dandy. Except when you are hunting for such names during a period of choppy action, or the market is in the late stage of its bull cycle, know this: These strong breakout moves may not work as beautifully as you might expect them to do.

The latest breakaway gap on May 19 by the big-cap business software powerhouse **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) drives this point home.

On that day, the bulls snorted a rejoicing tune after Salesforce.com reported a nearly breathtaking fiscal-first-quarter report (earnings per share up 50% to 24 cents, revenue up 27% to \$1.92 billion). The stock moved swiftly past a 77.92 cup-with-handle buy point. But as the chart shows, the quick gains got reeled back in as the broader market began slipping.
The breakaway gap is a unique style of breakout. First, you need the setup. A stock with excellent growth characteristics forms a solid base. Then, typically on a surprise of good news, it breaks out of the base by opening the trading session at a price high above the proper buy point -- so high, in fact, that the stock forms a gap between its lowest price during the day and the highest price seen in the prior trading session.

Stocks can gap down too. That's a telltale sign of price weakness.

While IBD research on this manner of breakout is ongoing, IBD markets writers have discovered that among companies with superior fundamentals, many breakouts that start with a big gap higher never fill that price gap as they rally 20%, 40% or more. This is why you can buy the stock with conviction, even if it has already risen more than 5% past the proper buy point, on the gap-up day. Those who judge the stock "over-priced" or "over-heated" miss a wonderful opportunity to grab a winner that is clearly demonstrating rare market power.

So, why did the recent breakaway gap by Salesforce.com fall flat?

If you invest for a while and go over your past bum trades, you learn that a bad market can swallow up a good stock. You learn that nothing in the market is mightier than the market itself. The market is the M in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749); it is the last letter of IBD's investment acronym, but in no way last in importance. In fact, your results in stocks will more than likely improve if you show the discipline to buy good-quality stocks *only in pronounced market uptrends,*and the uptrend is still relatively young in age. Read the [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) each day to uncover the market's trend.

So, if the market decides to zigzag up and down, it's going to force most stocks to follow its step. And that's exactly what's happened to one of the most innovative software firms born right before the dawn of the 21st century.

After its May 18-19 breakout, Salesforce.com gained 8% in a week. Not bad in seven days of work following the start of the move on May 18, followed by the breakaway gap a day later. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. However, it wasn't that big of a gain either. And in June, distribution days (signs of intense professional selling) began to pile up on the S&P 500; the large-cap benchmark fell significantly in higher volume on June 3, 7, 10 and 17. Salesforce.com's gains began to shrink as well.

On June 24, the stock made another price gap -- this time a gap down, falling 4.6% in heavy volume on the U.K.'s surprise vote to leave the European Union. The breakout gains got scotched. This week, Salesforce.com is trying to break out again past the same 77.92 entry.

In the third quarter of 2013, the markets were still humming. The Nasdaq was on its way to one of its best years since 2000. Salesforce gapped up on Aug. 30 that year, gliding well past a 46.20 pivot point in volume exploding six times its 50-day average.

In that day's newspaper, the IBD ratings were solid overall: A 91 Composite and 90 EPS Rating offset a mediocre 54 RS Rating, which reflected the stock's long sideways action. Salesforce shot 45% higher in just six months, rising to a high of 67 on Feb. 28, 2014, before correcting.

**Sell Winners Like A Pro:** [Fifth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/611488/201205211612/how-to-sell-winners-like-a-pro.aspx)

You can sell into strength or sell into weakness.

And it's even possible to do a little bit of both.

Namely, it can be a good idea to sell when a stock hits a new high in low turnover.

On the one hand, such action is a display of strength. The stock is touching a fresh peak, after all.

On the other hand, it can be a sign of weakness when this type of move comes in below-average daily volume. You prefer to see convincing turnover as a stock advances to never-before-seen heights.

Lower trade suggests that some big investors are losing their appetites for the stock.

**Intuitive Surgical**'s ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) action in December 2007 provides a good example of how to handle a stock touching a fresh high in weak volume.

By that time, the pioneer in robotic surgical equipment had enjoyed a strong advance for the year. It had more than tripled from its level at the end of 2006, but it hadn't yet run into the wood chipper that was the 2008 stock market.

Intuitive was rebounding from support at its 10-week moving average in the final weeks of 2007. **(1)** It was in the vicinity of a prior high, one reached in October 2007 **(2)** amid a strong quarterly earnings report.

Note how the October high had come in big weekly turnover, the highest trade in months. **(3)**

That wasn't the case at all in December. In the week ended Dec. 7, weekly volume was actually below average. **(4)**

Anyone holding Intuitive shares at that time could have interpreted that as a sign to take at least some profits.

Looking at a daily chart, the action also seemed discouraging. The new highs came on Dec. 7 and Dec. 10 in below-average turnover.

Keep in mind that a new high in weak turnover isn't always a sign to sell. You want to take into account the overall action of your stock, not just one factor.

In Intuitive's case, you would have factored in the fact that the stock already had run up considerably during the year, executing several breakouts and 10-week pullbacks along the way.

Selling in December 2007 would have allowed you to avoid a steady decline in 2008. **(5)**

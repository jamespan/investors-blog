*Second in a series*

  

Sometimes, good enough simply isn't good enough.

  

Seek out stocks of those companies that have reported recent quarterly earnings and sales growth of at least 25% from year-ago levels.

  

Even better, seek companies that show growth of 40% or more. The true market leaders tend to post such increases ahead of their big price runs.

  

This makes perfect sense. After all, you think you spotted a great stock of a great company. The company is doing something new, or has new management. Something is going on.

  

Why focus on big increases in both profits and sales? So let's say that your latest discovery has built a great-looking chart pattern, and has a new product that all the kids are going crazy about. Now look at the numbers.

  

What were the company's results in its most recent quarter? Let's say sales matched the results a year ago, even as earnings surged 50%.

  

Something is wrong.

  

Higher profit may be the result of cost-cutting measures. Well, it's always nice to have an efficient executive at the helm. But this is not the recipe for a booming company.

  

Now let's say earnings growth for the quarter is flat while sales surge 50%. Where's the money going?

  

Again, something is wrong.

  

Years of research show the minimum you should see for sales and earnings growth in the most recent quarter is indeed 25%.

  

But this doesn't mean you should settle for the minimum. More is better. Sure, if you find a stock with a beautiful, tight-action base, and you are excited about the company, then by all means have your way with it even if it just meets the minimum requirements.

  

But be real. Do you need 400 stocks in your portfolio? Probably you only need seven or eight winners, unless you're a large-fund manager.

  

So get the best ones. Don't be shy about expecting even triple-digit sales and profit gains. Such companies do exist.

  

The table shows a smattering of stocks that showed superior EPS and sales growth and were sector leaders in IBD's stock research tables when the market followed through Sept. 1 last year. Many broke out to big gains.

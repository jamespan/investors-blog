There's nothing more frustrating than being shaken out of a stock for a small gain, then watching from the sidelines as it triples.

  

It happens to everybody. But experienced investors know they make most of their profit from a few stocks. Their goal is to make the most money when they're really right. The key to sticking with a great stock through thick and thin? Conviction.

  

How does one build conviction? The first rule is ironclad: Buy the stock right and know the rule requiring selling if your loss hits 7% to 8%. If you tend to buy a few percentage points extended, you can easily be shaken out in a normal pullback.

  

Next, observe the eight-week rule. If a stock rises from a sound base and advances 20% or more in three weeks or less, you should hold it a total of eight weeks. At the end of that period, decide whether to hold it for a long-term gain.

  

A stock that can rise seven or eight straight weeks is also a candidate to be a long-term winner.

  

Even the best growth stocks can have sharp, scary sell-offs that last a few days. In those cases, study the weekly chart, not the daily, for a better long-term perspective.

  

"In a few cases, you may have to allow 13 weeks after your first purchase before you conclude a stock that hasn't moved is a dull, faulty selection," William O'Neil wrote in "How To Make Money In Stocks."

  

Don't get emotionally tied to a stock, but understand the company's story. Go to IBD's archives for articles about the company. IBD's New America and Internet & Technology sections can help.

  

Ask yourself: Is the stock a true leader with Composite or EPS ratings that put it in the No. 1 or No. 2 position in its industry group? And is the group among the best performing in the market?

  

**TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) runs successful off-price retail outlets T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls and Canadian outlets Winners and HomeSense. Pummeled more than 52% lower in the 2008 bear market **(1)**, the stock recovered and soared to new highs.

  

The reason? TJX produced steady, if not dramatic, results as it opened profitable stores throughout North America.

  

Earnings per share grew even during the 2008-09 recession and nearly tripled to \$2.83 in fiscal 2014 (ended in January) vs. 97 cents in fiscal 2008. Sales grew 50% over the same period.

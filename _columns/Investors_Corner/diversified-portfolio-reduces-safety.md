  Too Much Diversification Not As Safe As You Think

The conventional wisdom tells investors to diversify.

Spread your stock investment portfolio among many names. In fact, the more the merrier. Mix growth stocks with value plays, small caps with mega caps. Finally, balance U.S. equities with foreign issues.

The novice investor might feel comfortable with this advice. If a company that once looked rock-solid gets into trouble, you're bolstered by the rest of your portfolio. If your tech stocks tank, your mining, railroad and utility stocks might hold up.

Or maybe they won't. In a serious bear market, it's not very unusual for everything to take a tumble.

So don't use diversification as a mental crutch. Instead, concentrate on a few top names. You'll avoid mediocre results. It's too difficult and time-consuming to keep a close eye on too many issues.

Portfolio concentration is also safer. When IBD's [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) reports the stock market giving strong signs that it's heading south, you have a fast alternative: going quickly into cash.

Many money managers and financial planners deride cash because they view it as money being used unproductively. But it's the best place to be when a significant correction or a bear market arrives.

Legendary stock trader Jesse Livermore said that investors should be in the market only when all factors are in their favor. No one can play the market all the time and expect to win.

"There are times when money can be made investing and speculating in stocks, but money cannot be consistently made trading every day or every week during the year," Livermore said in his 1940 classic "How To Trade In Stocks." "Only the foolhardy will try it. It just is not in the cards and cannot be done."

To show how a few well-chosen stocks in a confirmed rally can lead to better profit potential, six stocks were selected from the IBD 50 of the Monday, Nov. 26, 2012, newspaper.

In the previous Friday, Nov. 23, a follow-through day signaled the beginning of a fresh rally. So it was the right time to buy. The six names were bought for a hypothetical \$240,000 cash-only portfolio, with \$40,000 invested in each position.

At the end of the 13-month period through Dec. 27, 2013, five showed a profit and one a loss, **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).

The gain in this hypothetical exercise was 46.9%, a \$112,571 profit vs. 30.7% for the S&P 500. That's terrific performance, but the experienced investor wouldn't have handled it that way.

Instead, buy stocks when they break out of bases. If you bought correctly, your stock shouldn't go down more than 7%-8%. If it does, you'll know that you were wrong and should sell.

That was the case with Lululemon. A disciplined investor would have cut losses short, never allowing it to drop 16% below its purchase price.

**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) could have been bought coming out of a base at 161.88 on March 25, 2013. When it dropped below its 50-day moving average on March 24, 2014 in big trade, one could have sold and netted a 36% profit.

[Patterns To Market Wealth](http://news.investors.com/special-report/627625-patterns-to-market-wealth.aspx): Eighth In A Series

  

Learning to spot the three- or four-weeks-tight pattern, an add-on point, can bolster your portfolio's returns.

  

The three- or four-weeks-tight is exactly what the name suggests: three or four weekly price closes nearly unchanged from each other. Each close should not differ by more than 1.5% from the prior week, although within 1% would be ideal.

  

Remember, an add-on point needs something to add from. Look for the three-weeks-tight after a stock breaks out from a base and logs some gains.

  

Beware the three-weeks-tight with no significant prior uptrend. Also beware the three-weeks-tight on a stock that simply doesn't move very much. Look at all the three-weeks-tights on the **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) weekly chart. Are those really entries to a hot growth stock? Certainly not.

  

Volume should cool off as the stock builds this pattern. Even better, it should be cooling from elevated levels seen as the stock scored those big post-breakout gains.

  

What are we describing here? A stock had broken out of a solid base, the first sign that institutions are scrambling for shares.

  

After a significant gain, the normal bout of profit-taking appears. But rather than fall under the weight of this selling, the stock moves sideways for three (or four) weeks. Why? The same institutions that provided support in the original base also are providing support as some investors cash in their winnings.

  

Those are the invisible hands placed just below the market, palms up, ready to catch whatever gets shaken loose.

  

Server virtualization firm **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) built a near-perfect four-weeks tight in 2010. It had climbed 22% from its 44.99 cup-with-handle buy point before baking its three-weeks-tight cake.

  

The first week of the three-weeks-tight, ended March 5, saw the stock rise 9% 1. The first week's gain can be any amount.

  

Price changes in the following three weeks were 0.5%, 1.3% and 1%. Volume during the tight phase was completely under control.

  

In that four-week span, VMware got as high as 54.99. It pushed through the 55.09 buy point April 12 2. Volume surged, and so did the stock.

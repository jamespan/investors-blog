If you buy a stock at 50 and it falls to 45, you should buy more shares and lower your average cost, right? Wrong!


You could easily be throwing good money after bad.


Many strategists say buying more shares of a stock in decline is smart because in the long run your average cost is lower. But that assumes the stock will bounce back. Today's damaged market shows that long-term assumptions are risky.


Instead, only add to a position if it's working in your favor.


So what's wrong with averaging down? First, if a stock falls below your entry point, buying more should be the last thing on your mind. You should really be thinking about cutting your loss.


Second, once a stock starts falling, no one knows if it's making only a brief correction or something worse.


Remember, many companies that were thought to be indestructible have gone out of business.


**Mindray Medical International** ([MR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MR)) cleared a 42.10 buy point in the week ended Aug. 6 1. The stock surged 10% in nearly quadruple average volume. Despite that, the stock gave everything back and was down 8% from the buy point the next day.


Mindray managed to find support at its 200-day moving average 2 and started to rebound. Those that didn't sell may have been tempted to even themselves out by adding shares. But the comeback died and the stock plunged 70% over the next three months 3 .


Instead of averaging down, average up or "pyramid" into a position. Divide up your capital and enter in installments. After you make your initial buy, follow up with purchases of fewer shares only if the stock keeps moving higher.


Let's say your initial buy uses 50% of the allotted capital. Once the stock moves 2% to 3% past your buy point, you use 30% of your allocated capital to buy more shares.


Make one last buy with the remaining 20% once the stock trades 4% to 5% above your first entry point.


You can also add shares when a stock pulls back successfully to the 10-week moving average the first or second time after a breakout.


**Mechel** ([MTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTL)) passed a 48.03 buy point Sept. 13, 2007 4.


The stock pulled back gently, then climbed 2.5% above the initial 48.03 entry point, providing a chance to add shares 5. The next day, Mechel traded 5% above the initial buy point, the ideal point to buy the rest of the shares. Mechel rallied 85% by late October 6.

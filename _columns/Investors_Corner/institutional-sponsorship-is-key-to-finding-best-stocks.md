**In Search of CAN SLIM:** [Sixth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/607647/201204171805/in-search-of-can-slim.aspx)


Finding the best stocks is a matter of finding out where big investors are putting their money.


It literally pays to track a stock's institutional sponsorship, represented by the I in CAN SLIM.


That's because banks, pension funds and hedge funds have millions, even billions, of dollars at their disposal. They account for up to 70% or more of daily volume in the market and therefore have the power to drive stock prices.


IBD offers several methods for keeping tabs on where the big guns are — or aren't — going.


MarketSmith, an IBD-affiliated service, provides weekly data showing the number of funds owning a company's shares in the past four quarters. Look for stocks showing a steady increase in fund ownership.


IBD's proprietary Accumulation-Distribution Rating is another tool. It's found in the Stock Checkup at Investors.com and in IBD's daily stock tables. It analyzes a stock's price and volume movements over the past 13 weeks and assigns scores ranging from A to E. It's best to zero in on stocks with an A or B rating, which means that institutional investors are net buyers.


The most timely indicator of institutional sponsorship, however, is a stock's daily trading volume — also shown in the daily stock tables. For instance, when a stock's volume jumps more than 40% higher than average at the breakout, it's a good bet that big funds are involved.


Let's look at **Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)). It broke out above a split-adjusted 44.65 cup-with-handle buy point in June 2004 **1** (it split 2-for-1 in August) and rose 157% in 14 months.


Potash's move was telegraphed prior to its breakout by rising institutional sponsorship.


The number of funds investing in Potash had risen from 146 in the final quarter of 2003 to 154 in the first quarter of 2004 to 163 in April to June 2004, coinciding with the breakout.


In the two months prior to the breakout, Potash's Accumulation-Distribution Rating fluctuated between B and B+. Demand for the stock was growing. Finally, volume was huge — 560% above its average daily turnover — when Potash crossed its buy point.


In addition to identifying stocks with rising institutional sponsorship, it's important to look at the quality of the funds buying shares. IBD's Mutual Funds section ranks the top growth funds and shows what they're buying.


The Fidelity Growth Fund and the T. Rowe Price New Era Fund were among the top institutional investors owning large blocks of Potash shares when the stock broke out.


Keep in mind that funds typically build positions in a stock over time. So it's important to identify stocks that meet IBD's CAN SLIM criteria early and keep an eye on them as they form bases and hit their buy points.

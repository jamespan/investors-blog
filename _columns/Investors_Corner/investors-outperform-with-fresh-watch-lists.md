Some investors are happy performing simply in line with the S&P 500 every year.

But there's another group of investors, many of them IBD readers, who are true students of the market.

They like the thrill of the hunt â€” finding that next big market-winner in the early stages of a new bull market. They're good at taking profits on the way up and raising cash near market tops. They're always looking for an edge to help them outperform.

The edge is developed by hard work, discipline and a desire to beat the market using fundamental and technical analysis to find the very best growth stocks.

Even the best investors have lazy streaks in them. But in the end, it doesn't get in the way of hard work, which is what is needed to go from good to great.

It's human nature to procrastinate. Writers do it. Athletes do it. Executives do it. Even investors do it.

The past two [Investor's Corner topics](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) outlined two bad habits that are best avoided in the journey to becoming a better investor. Bad Habit No. 1: Don't buy blindly based on a stock tip. No. 2: Don't freeze up, unable to pull the trigger, in the early stages of a new market rally.

Bad Habit No. 3 is failing to be prepared with an actionable watch list when major averages flash a [buy signal](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735761&sourceid=735764) after a correction. Buy signals, or follow-through days, have been at every single market bottom in the past, and investors with clean, actionable watch lists benefit the most.

When stock indexes are selling off in heavy volume, it's human nature to stop paying attention. It's easy to procrastinate in building a watch list of candidates that could be the next bull market leaders when the selling finally runs its course.

At the start of new bull markets, new names in new sectors tend to provide the strongest leadership.

Use screens like the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/) (every day in IBD Leaderboard), [Your Weekly Review](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) (Tuesday and Thursday) to keep your watch lists fresh. Target newer companies with top fundamentals. Prune the list periodically, cutting names loose that aren't performing like they were before.

IBD's stock tables quickly uncover the market's emerging stars. The tables are arranged by sector strength. At the beginning of each sector listing, look for Sector Leaders and IPOs within the last 15 years with EPS and RS [Ratings](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) of 80 or higher.

It's easy to latch onto a former leader thinking that it has the potential to be a leader again. **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) was a huge winner in the 1990s bull market before a long period of sideways movement ahead of the 2008 bear market crash (see accompanying chart). Some are confident that new CEO Satya Nadella has the company on the right path, but it's tough for a company of Microsoft's size to reinvent itself. Meaningful sales growth is often hard to come by.

At the time when Microsoft couldn't get out of its own way, enterprise software firm **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was making noise with a successful IPO in June 2004 **(1**). The company grew vast and grabbed a leadership position in the enterprise software space. No surprise, since companies take advantage of new software technologies, like the cloud, to operate more efficiently.

Companies stuck in neutral on Wall Street are rarely compelling investments. Many are suffering from a lack of innovation or an inability to adapt to changing industry conditions.

The [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) acronym comprises the seven traits that past market winners showed before massive price moves. They're all important, but be careful not to underestimate the N, which stands for "new." In your hunt for the next great growth stock, make sure that the company is a young gun, still in the early stages of growth, where innovation is alive and well.

It's usually a [new product or service](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735738&sourceid=735749) that drives growth for an emerging leader. When **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) debuted in January 2006, it didn't take long for consumers to embrace the company's obsession with fresh ingredients.

Meanwhile, the popularity of gift cards in recent years has been a boon for Safeway spinoff **Blackhawk Network** ([HAWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAWK)). And the 'new' for **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) is health savings accounts, which are becoming more popular as employers switch employees to high-deductible health plans. The stock has more than doubled since its [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in July 2014.

Sometimes, new management fuels a turnaround. After a long period of sideways price movement, Jeffrey Sloan took over the CEO post at **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) on Oct. 1, 2013. That week, shares surged 13% and broke out of a long consolidation. The breakout started a lengthy uptrend for the provider of electronic transaction processing services.

Other times, a company can adapt successfully to new conditions in its industry group.

Amid strong demand for the iPhone, business has been booming in recent years for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) suppliers like **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)).

Keep in mind, though, that fundamentals can look the best at or near a stock's top. All three chip names have made big price moves in recent years. Remember, the goal is to buy a growth stock in the early stages of a move, not the later stages.

Meanwhile, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) wasn't looking too good when it pulled back 83% off its high in 2011-12. At the time, Wall Street was questioning the company's price hikes and growth prospects. But Netflix successfully pivoted from DVDs by mail to streaming movies, fueling a new growth phase for the company.

The N in CAN SLIM also stands for "new high." It's no surprise that minicharts found in screens like [Sector Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/sector-leaders-review.htm) and the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/top10/default.aspx) showcase stocks trading near new highs. That's because decades of IBD research show that stocks tend to make their biggest gains when they break out to new high ground. These breakouts are typically fueled by institutional buying, the lifeblood of any successful breakout.

In IBD's stock tables, the N in CAN SLIM can be seen in several leading sectors of the market. The Medical sector has been strong for a while. Several Sector Leaders are shown at the start of the listing (see the research tables starting on page B3). Underneath it, several IPOs within the past 15 years with EPS and RS Ratings of 80 and higher are shown.

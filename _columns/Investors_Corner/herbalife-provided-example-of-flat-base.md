[Patterns To Market Wealth](http://news.investors.com/special-report/627625-patterns-to-market-wealth.aspx): Fourth In A Series


Here's one nice thing about a flat base: As its name suggests, this pattern doesn't feature a steep, hold-on-to-your-hat correction.


By definition, a flat base consists of a stock price decline of less than 15%, rather than the 35% you might see with a cup-shaped structure or double bottom.


It also can be shorter than other bases, forming in as few as five weeks. The typical buy point is the price high made before the decline, plus 10 cents.


This type of stock chart pattern can involve some wobbles, but the up-and-down action will feel more like a kiddie roller coaster than one of those rides boasting the steepest drop ever.


For a good example of a flat base, consider **Herbalife** 's ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) action almost two years ago.


The network market of weight-loss and nutritional products had touched what was then a record high in early December 2010. **1**


It proceeded to consolidate in a tight fashion for about six weeks.  **2** The 10-week moving average served as a support level.


The stock then endured a bigger, but still relatively mild, drop in the week ended Jan. 21, 2011. **3** Volume was strong for the week, as support at the 10-week line gave way.


Herbalife ended up hitting the low point in its flat base during this week. Even at this low, the correction in the base was only 12%.


The stock then started to form the right side of its base. Note the weeks of accumulation, meaning up weeks with strong volume. **4**


You prefer to see weeks of accumulation outnumber weeks of distribution in any base, and Herbalife delivered in that regard.


The stock, part of IBD's Cosmetics/Personal Care industry group, regained its 10-week line in mid-February. It broke out of its flat base in the week ended Feb. 25, 2011. **5**


Volume came in strong for the breakout.  **6** Again, that's what you prefer to see.


Herbalife more than doubled after clearing its flat base, peaking 14 months later â€” in April 2012. It plunged after reaching that peak, hammered by fears that noted short-seller David Einhorn could be betting against the stock.

  How To Trade: Should You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

Buying a stock during earnings season can be good, bad or somewhere in between. In other words, it's very unpredictable. First, it's hard to know whether the company will beat, miss or meet analyst forecasts. And second, it may be even more difficult to guess how shares will react to the report.




To further complicate matters, it's not just the actual results that can boost, or weigh on, a stock's price.


The overall market environment can also affect quarterly reports. There tend to be more good earnings in a strong market than in a choppy one.


**Feel The Market**
-------------------


The choppiness in the market has affected stock price action lately, making breakouts more risky and volatile than in a solid uptrend. That's why even some leading stocks have had trouble following through on breakouts and moving sharply out of the proper buy range.


Heading into [earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), an investor will ideally be sitting on a nice profit cushion if he or she bought shares on a previous breakout. That way, there is still time to act even if the stock plunges on its earnings report.


But if an investor is holding only a small profit — or no gain — and the stock tanks, that can quickly turn into a sizable loss. On the flip side, if the stock gaps up and takes off on the report — it's all good. So what's a shareholder to do?

One safe tactic is to wait until the company announces before making your move. You face no downside risk, and will hopefully be able to catch shares on the way up.


If the stock gaps up powerfully past a [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and [runs out of the normal buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/), you can still buy on the [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/). But the company must be a true leader, and losses must still be cut short if the stock loses ground fast.


Another strategy to help reduce earnings-related risk is to use [weekly call options](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/), if they are available for the stock in question. (Please see the regular column in IBD Weekly as well.)


A Unique Hold Rule After Buying A Stock
---------------------------------------


Harman International Industries, which used to trade under the ticker "HAR," rallied 27% from its late-January breakout in 2015 to the early March start of its last base, which had elements of a [large and deep cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The stock even triggered the eight-week-hold rule by rising 20% in the first two weeks after clearing the buy point.


![Earnings Season](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IC2-081018-300x160.jpg)The rule expired during the midst of the car infotainment system maker's next base, a [seven-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 145.10. Aside from a small dip March 20 in unusually heavy volume **(1)**, the pattern looked mostly routine.


On April 30, Harman posted fiscal Q3 earnings and sales that missed views. A 9% jump in EPS was the smallest increase in eight quarters. The 4% year-over-year rise in sales to \$1.46 billion showed deceleration in the rate of growth vs. 32%, 22% and 19% in recent quarters. Shares gapped down that day **(2)**, falling 15% in fast turnover to a three-month low, before settling for a 7% loss.


That big decline meant that for investors who bought when Harman cleared the latest new base, it was time to cut losses short. IBD calls this [the golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Investors who bought ahead of the announcement likely took a bath, as the stock fell below its 50-day moving average. It's trended mostly lower since, and is now below its 200-day line as well.

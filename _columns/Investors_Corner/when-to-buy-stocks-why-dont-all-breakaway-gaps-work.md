When a stock gaps up so powerfully in price that it rises past a proper buy point, it may instantly feel like it's time to pop the champagne.


Numerous star stocks in the market, after all, have begun their huge price runs to new highs that way. Smartphone maker Research In Motion (now known as **BlackBerry** ([BB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BB))) did so in the final week of 2003. **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) did it on Aug. 4, 2010. Then the online travel agent did it again on Aug. 5, 2016.


But not every breakaway gap works. And wide-area networking gear firm **Ubiquiti Network**s ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) offers a valuable lesson for those who are hunting for growth-stock greatness.


Why do some gaps work, and why do some fail?


While the [state of the market](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) is always a key factor, a growth investor should focus on putting money into the companies with the very best fundamentals. These firms have the greatest chance of building a good base, breaking out with fury, climbing to new highs, and making investors happy.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ICubnt103017-1024x546.png)In a breakaway gap, demand is so hot that the stock's intraday low is higher than the prior session's high. This produces the gap. Sometimes the gain is so big that the stock opens at a price well above the normal buy point in a well-formed base, such as a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), or [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/).


If the company has superior profit and sales gains, industry-leading products and services, top-notch management, and good prospects for further growth, then an investor can feel justified in buying at or near the opening price, even though that price is extended well above the standard buy point. If, for example, the buy point in a good cup with handle is 45.10, and XYZ shares open the session at 49, one could buy at that price even though it's nearly 9% above the proper entry.


Ubiquiti gapped up powerfully on Aug. 3 following its fiscal Q4 results. The stock leapt more than 16%; at the open of 64.21, it was just shy of surpassing the cup's 64.72 buy point (10 cents above the left-side high). An investor could have bought as soon as Ubiquiti rose past 64.72. Yet over the next three weeks, Ubiquiti failed to reach new high ground.


A holder would have had sell and cut losses as the stock began a swift decline on Aug. 28. Just three days later, Ubiquiti dropped more than 7% below the 64.72 entry.


One major flaw in that cup: Most of it had formed beneath both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The base itself was littered with many big daily declines in price in unusually heavy volume.



Another flaw was in the fundamentals. Q4 earnings rose just 9% to 75 cents a share, following EPS gains of 38%, 55%, 24% and 24% in the prior four quarters. You want to see profit growth accelerate ahead of a breakout, not slow down.

**IBD's TAKE:** *One of the best ways to see historical charts is via [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012GE5). The date-change function makes it simple to go back in time and see how a great stock behaved at its breakout, via a daily, weekly or monthly chart.*

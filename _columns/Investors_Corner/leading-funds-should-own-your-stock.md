Individual investors buying a few round lots here and there are not going to have a big impact on a stock's price. But institutional investors, armed with significantly more firepower, can send stocks sharply higher or lower.

The I in CAN SLIM stands for institutional sponsorship, or ownership by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions and other major investors. They account for the bulk of trading on the major exchanges. So before you buy a stock, make sure some of these professionals are in it. It's even better when you see them increasing their holdings.

Professionals have millions of dollars or more to invest on behalf of clients. They usually buy thousands of shares at a time. Because of the size of their investments, they can't go in and buy a full position all at once without running up prices too much.

It may take a fund weeks or months to build up to a full position. Most mutual funds report their holdings to the Securities & Exchange Commission every quarter. The data are available about six weeks after that.

Even though there's a time lag, investors can still compare the latest quarterly portfolio N-Q filing with the prior one and see what a fund has been buying or selling. And make sure you check if fund managers increased their stakes.

Besides the number of sponsors, you also want to check out the quality. Generally, it's best when leading growth funds own shares. So as you analyze a company for a potential trade candidate, make sure you see some top-rated mutual funds that own shares. Newer and smaller companies tend to have much less sponsorship.

Tools in the print edition of IBD and online at Investors.com can help you find stocks with institutional sponsorship. Your Weekly Review each Friday shows the best-rated mutual fund with a big investment for each of the stocks.

In each month's mutual fund special, you'll find a list of top buys and sells of highly ranked mutual funds. The accompanying table shows a few stocks that were in the Sept. 5 feature showing new buys by top-performing mutual funds.

And at Stock Checkup on Investors.com, you can find the percentage change in the number of mutual funds owning a stock. Just below that, you'll find the number of quarters of increasing fund ownership. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating also gives you a sense of the strength of institutional demand. An A or B means they are net buyers.

A classic IBD [sell signal](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) is the long-overdue sharp break and significant close below the 10-week line in heavy volume. It can indicate an impending change in trend. But what exactly do we mean by "heavy" volume?




Look for at least a 40% increase in turnover compared to the 10-week average to indicate that institutions may be shifting their mindset toward the stock.


Every [IBD weekly chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=weekly) on Investors.com shows the 10-week moving average as a line draped across the weekly volume bars. Click on any volume bar to see the actual volume and the percentage change.


That break — combined with other sell signals — can be a great time to lock in solid gains. However, it's never a certainty that the stock will continue to fall; many leading growth stocks will simply form a base and offer a [new buy point](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/). So keep track of that stock. Be prepared to buy that stock back if it breaks out again.


It's also impossible to know how long or far the stock can fall before rebounding. Factors include the strength of a company's fundamentals and the probability that either the company's growth or the greater economy will stall.

The stock's significant close below the 10-week line was its first time since an April 20, 2015, breakout above a 389.47 buy point.

That entry could be considered either a [giant cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) starting back in January 2014, or an [eight-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).


Investors who sold could lock in a nearly 56% advance using the weekly closing price of 607.05. Amazon went on to fall 32% from its peak. Yet, that wouldn't be the end of the stock's long-term move. It formed a new [classic cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and offered a fresh 638.11 buy point. On April 29, the stock broke out past that level **(2)** on strong results.



**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) triggered that sell signal in the week ended Feb. 9 this year amid the market's sudden drop. That week, the stock declined 7.5% on a 68% surge in volume. Over the next five weeks, the social media giant rallied in low volume, showing that institutions weren't very excited to purchase additional shares. This past week, the stock has dropped more than 10% and took out its 40-week line on a deluge of negative news.


Facebook [had not made sufficient efforts to protect user data](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-data-leak-failure-will-bring-fierce-scrutiny-regulatory-risk/) in regards to Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm. Late Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook's chief data security officer Alex Stamos would be [leaving the company](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-security-chief-alex-stamos-leaves-after-clashes-over-russian-disinformation-response/). Shares dove 5% in response.



Blue chip **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) saw a [potential sell signal](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/boeing-new-sell-signal-dow-jones-stock-market/) during the week ended March 16 when it dropped nearly 7%. Volume only increased 37% above average, just shy of the 40% mark, but it had the feel of an expectation breaker. Shares closed near the lows of the week, indicating strong selling pressure.


Its close below the 10-week line was the first since an Oct. 26, 2016, breakout above a flat base's 139.55 buy point. At its peak on Feb. 28, Boeing  advanced 166% — a tremendous gain for a large-cap name.

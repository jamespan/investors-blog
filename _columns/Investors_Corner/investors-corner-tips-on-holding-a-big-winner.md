_Twelfth In A Series_

Knowing when to sell a big winner is one of the hardest challenges for all growth investors. Period.

If you've experienced a few market cycles, you'd agree that buying is easier than selling. There's usually only one correct buy point when the stock starts its move.

The issue of selling is more open-ended. Let's say you sold every one of your winners when it reaches a 25% gain. You've simplified the process, but you may miss out on a big winner's luscious reward.

If your stock gains 20% or more in three weeks or less, and the market is healthy, the first step is to hold your stock for a minimum eight weeks. That's one key step to seeing how much growth potential your winner has. Most of the best winners need a year or more to complete their runs.

What if a stock gives you a 50% or 100% gain? You could sell and move on. You can buy it back later. But before you do anything, pause and ask: Does this company have what it takes to be like **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) in the 1970s, **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) in the 1990s, or **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in the 2000s?

If the fundamentals, the products and the management quality are all truly top class, then you might consider holding through its first or second correction.

This means sitting tight even as the stock dives below its 50-day moving average. If your profit cushion is big enough, you may have the luxury to see how the stock behaves around the 200-day line.

That was the test taken by patient shareholders in **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) as the premier software firm in the 1990s racked up a 370% profit from its April 1997 breakout **1** to its peak at 119.94 at the end of 1999. Everyone can learn from the stock's action in the twilight of its big run.

After clearing the buy point on April 18, 1997, the stock gained 21% in nine days, so the eight-week hold rule kicked in **2**.

After gaining 56%, the stock made a sharp three-week sell-off in December 1997, falling as much as 19.5% **3** and testing its 10-week moving average. The paper gain would have shrunk to 17%. But the stock rebounded rapidly over the next six weeks and thrust to new highs **4**. If you had sold, you could have bought back the stock.

Microsoft formed a new double bottom in the 1998 bear market, then rose 75% through July 1999 **5**. The time to sell came in the spring of 2000. After failing to clear a late-stage base, the stock went into free fall through its 40-week line in huge volume **6**. It sank 16% and 17% in the weeks ended April 7 and 14, respectively.

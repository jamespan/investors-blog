Now that we're deep into the second half of 2019, are you still putting big profits in the best growth stocks on your list of investing goals for the year?

To achieve that, review your past trades so you can figure out your biggest weaknesses. Then you'll know what you need to work on.

If you don't already, track all your buys and sells in a notebook or on your PC. Log each profit or loss, how long you owned each stock, and any big price and volume moves.

Next, print out daily and weekly charts of all stocks you traded. Separate the leaders from the dogs by putting charts of your winning trades in one pile and losers in another.

## To Meet Your Investing Goals, First Confront Your Mistakes

Study them to see what each stock did after you sold it.

Did you miss out on a big rally by getting in too late â€” or too early? Ignore red flags and let a stock fall way below your purchase price? Try to buy a stock before a breakout and get quickly shaken out?

See how well you followed IBD's buy and sell rules. Make sure you paid attention to each stock's fundamentals, price and volume action, and basing pattern. Buying at the pivot point on a breakout is key. So is [cutting your losses at 7% to 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

If you let losses sink below this level, you could set stop-loss orders to automatically trigger the sale for you, until you learn to quickly cut losses yourself. Pay attention to support lines like the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Violations of these levels send up a red flag.

## Never Forget To Do This

Finding stocks with strong fundamentals your weak point? Jot down IBD's SmartSelect Ratings in your log. List each stock's Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength and Industry Group RS ratings. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) also helps you save time.

Investors.com's [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) helps you make sure your stocks are leaders. Don't forget to check sales and profit growth too.

Do you buy too early or late? Review how to spot bases, [pivot points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and breakouts. Always wait to buy until a high-volume breakout from a [sound base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Don't buy stocks [extended more than 5% from their pivots](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).

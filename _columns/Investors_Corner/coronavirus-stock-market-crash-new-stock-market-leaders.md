Believe it or not, some good will come of the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/). At some point, waves of institutional selling in the major stock indexes will subside, replaced with bullish bouts of institutional buying.




After the coronavirus stock market crash runs its course, new stock leaders will emerge. The common bond? Bullish Accumulation/Distribution Ratings.


The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy institutional selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.


Coronavirus Stock Market Crash: The Hunt For New Leaders
--------------------------------------------------------


Daily price and volume action in a stock, or a stock index, is analyzed for the past three months. A stock rising in price in heavy volume (under accumulation) will generally get a high rating. Stocks falling in heavy volume (under distribution) will get a low rating.


Heavy volume is almost always the work of institutional investors. When a stock that normally trades 1 million shares a day suddenly trades 5 million, it's not 100- or 200-shares buys that are fueling a big gain for the stock. It's mutual funds, banks and other institutional investors buying big blocks of shares. The A/D Rating helps pick this activity up.

Stocks On The Move
------------------


The [Stocks On The Move screen](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) on the home page of Investors.com is a great way to monitor institutional buying and selling in the market. The screen is continuously updated, highlighting stocks rising and falling in heavy volume. Some will eventually form an [outstanding base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) and break out to new highs, offering astute IBD readers an [excellent buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The coronavirus stock market crash has resulted in a scant number of stocks in IBD's database with lofty A/D Ratings. That's not surprising because institutional investors have generally been selling stock hard since late February. As of Wednesday's close, the A/D Ratings for all three major stock indexes was E, the worst possible.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IC033020-300x161.jpg)A stock's [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) is another way to gauge institutional buying in a stock. It's available for every stock in the Technical Performance section of [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gsx-techedu-inc-cl-a-ads-gsx.aspx).


The ratio is calculated by dividing total volume on up days by total volume on down days. A ratio of 1.0 indicates an even amount of buying and selling over the past 50 days. A ratio above 1.0 points to heavier demand — or more buying — while a ratio below 1.0 suggests more selling.


The accompanying table is top stocks in the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) showing relative strength. Not surprisingly, all have healthy A/D Ratings.

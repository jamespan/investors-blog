Take a few seconds and look at the cup base that Microchip Technology began forming in January, and you might think it's worth further investigation.

Taking such care to examine a chart pattern and then saying "I'll pass" can pay off. It's especially true when you can sidestep a quick, unnecessary loss.

**Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)) formed a base that proved faulty. Why? It served up a good example of the V-shaped cup.

Cup bases should show a significant correction in price. According to William J. O'Neil's "How To Make Money in Stocks," the decline in a [good cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) typically exceeds 12%. A drop of 20%, 25% or even more than 30% to 33% is perfectly normal.

Expect to see a significant uptrend in price before the left side of the cup forms. Why? You want proof that the stock can run up nicely and generate profits for those who buy right.

## A Good Cup Base Shows Orderly Moves

After a stock makes a nice rise, see how it declines to form the cup. Ideally, the correction is orderly and relatively smooth. You'll likely see a sharp decline in one or a few weeks on the base's left side. But you also want to see the stock trade tightly on a weekly closing basis. As you view a chart, ask this: "Is the stock having a difficult time going down?"

Mild sell-offs and calm turnover on the downside hint that fund managers are stepping in to buy shares and support the stock, even as it falls in price.

But then the Chandler, Ariz., firm slid more than 13% in the week ended Feb. 9. It nose-dived below its 10-week moving average.

Volume soared to 36 million shares, the most since February 2017 **(2)**.

## Cup Base, Take Two

The member of IBD's semiconductor manufacturing industry group made an enviable rebound. It enjoyed four straight up weeks, and three of them came in above-average trade. The 10-week cup base offered a 99.27 buy point. Yet as the weekly chart shows, the stock broke out during the week ended March 16 but reversed by week's end. Those who bought at 99.27 had to [cut losses at 8% or less](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

The next base looked more sound. The cup's contours seemed more rounded. But volume actually fell in the breakout week vs. the prior week **(3)**. Also, Microchip's earnings and sales growth had shown a minor amount of growth deceleration — from EPS gains of 66%, 56% and 50% during the first three quarters of 2017 to growth of 30%, 21% and 23% the past three quarters.

IBD readers have undoubtedly heard or read the term "distribution" at IBD workshops, Investors.com or inside the pages of IBD Weekly.


It's synonymous with institutional selling, whether it's in an individual stock or a major stock index. Big downside moves in explosive volume are the clearest sign of distribution, a sign that mutual funds, hedge funds, banks and insurance companies are unloading shares.


But sometimes it's not so obvious. How can you learn to recognize signs of institutional selling in a stock index, or individual stock?


![icanasdaq112116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ICaNasdaq112116.png)Distribution days, or higher-volume declines, are monitored daily in [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) column. But there are nuances to them, and it's important to differentiate mild distribution from heavy distribution. A distribution day is counted when the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq falls at least 0.2% in volume higher than the prior session.


When the distribution-day count hits five or six in the Big Picture Market Pulse, that's reason to be cautious, but the market has shown in the past that it can hold up even when the distribution-day count is elevated. Earlier this year, there were several times when the indexes had a distribution-day count of seven or eight, yet indexes were holding near highs and leading growth stocks were generally in good shape. Remember, in most cases, a 0.2% or 0.3% decline in higher volume isn't as severe as a 1%-2% decline in higher volume.


Distribution can also come in the form of stalling action. It generally occurs when an index rises a small amount but closes in the bottom half of its intraday range. In most cases, volume will be higher than the prior session, but there are some exceptions. Watch for these rare instances by reading The Big Picture.


While monitoring distribution in the market is important, it's also important to monitor the action of leading growth stocks. Is the distribution-day count elevated? Are market leaders breaking below key support levels in heavy volume? These are two big negatives when assessing market health. But in recent months, an elevated distribution-day count was seen, but damage was limited in leading growth stocks.


In late October to early November, distribution days started to cluster ominously in the Nasdaq composite. The tech index flashed five of them in seven trading sessions from Oct. 25 to Nov. 2 (see accompanying image). That's normally enough to turn the market on its head, but the market quickly righted itself on news of Trump's presidential win.


The distribution-day count remains high for the Nasdaq, but some will start falling off the count right after 25 trading sessions have passed. The thinking here: As time passes, distribution days become less relevant.

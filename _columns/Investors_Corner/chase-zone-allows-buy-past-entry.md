  Chase Zone Allows You To Buy A Stock Past Buy Point

If you've ever wondered why you can't just buy a stock at whatever price it's currently trading at, you're not alone. And in actuality, you can buy a stock no matter what the price. But if you're trying to maximize the upside potential of a leading stock, getting in at the proper buy point is your best bet. Why?


"If you try to buy before this point, you may be premature," IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "In many cases, the stock will never get to its breakout point but rather will stall or actually decrease in price."


Stocks need time to consolidate their gains, particularly after a big advance. That's why following a move up, they will often form a base. Some common base patterns include the cup, cup with handle, double bottom, and flat base.


The ideal time to buy — assuming the company's fundamentals, stock price and volume action, as well as the overall market, all check out — is when the stock crosses its proper buy point.


Even if you don't get in at the precise buy point, don't fret. There is a 5% chase zone that gives investors the chance to buy before a stock is considered extended.


Beyond that 5% threshold, risk becomes elevated, so it's best to wait for a secondary entry, like a future bounce off the 50-day or 10-week moving average, or for a new base to form.


"If you buy at more than 5% to 10% past the precise buy point, you are buying late and will more than likely get caught in the next price correction," O'Neil wrote.


There is one exception to the 5% buy range: the breakaway gap. On rare occasions, a leading stock may gap up at the open, soar right past the buy point and end up well above the prior session's high and the proper entry.


For instance, if a company reports an upside earnings surprise after the close, the stock may gap up at the next open. Such a breakaway gap is a sign of unusual strength, so investors could consider buying beyond the normal 5% chase zone.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) cleared a series of flat bases back in 2005. It gapped up out of a base July 27 **(**1)**** after its Q2 earnings report, then triggered the eight-week hold rule the next day.


After a 36% advance, shares began consolidating in late August. After the close on Oct. 25, the surgical-gear maker reported Q3 earnings that surged 224% and topped views by a wide margin. It also raised its full-year guidance.


The stock gapped up and soared 25% the next day, blowing past a 79.52 buy point and the 5% chase zone, which extended to 83.50. In this case, the general rule of thumb is to buy as close to the opening price as possible.


Intuitive sported solid fundamentals at its breakout, including a 99 Composite, 77 Earnings Per Share, 99 Relative Strength and a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Its medical systems industry group was ranked an A as well.


Shares rallied 37% from the buy point in less than three weeks to trigger the eight-week hold rule **(2).** By January 2006, Intuitive rallied 75% before diving into a new price correction.

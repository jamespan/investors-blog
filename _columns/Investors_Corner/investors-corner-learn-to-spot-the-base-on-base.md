Your stock breaks out, all seems fine — and then it stalls.

  

You throw up your hands and give up on a stock which, in reality, may just be regrouping to make the very move you had been looking for in the first place.

  

You may have failed to recognize a base-on-base in the making. But the base-on-base is a must-know for any IBD reader.

  

So, what is a base-on-base? Exactly what it sounds like.

  

You're looking for two bases, one on top of the other. The first base needn't be perfect. It can be a mess.

  

The second base is far more important, especially if the first has problems. This is the stock's chance to correct its flaws.

  

The second base's peak should stand no more than 20% above the first base's buy point.

  

Crucially, the second-base's floor should sink at least as low as the first base's peak. If the second base just hangs in the air without contact with the earlier pattern, you aren't looking at a base-on-base.

  

There's no guarantee that a weak breakout will lead to a base-on-base. Don't walk away from this column thinking you have to hold onto any breakout that goes nowhere.

  

But keep an eye on your former holding. It may be building on that first base to set up a healthy run after all.

  

Look at athletic-wear maker **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), which built a base-on-base from December 2010 through the end of March 2011.

  

Or did it?

  

The first base, a flat base, appears from the week ended Dec. 17 through the Jan. 21 week. It then pushed past its 60.24 buy point **1**.

  

Under Armour only got as far as 70.69, a 17% gain, before one could see it was moving more sideways than higher. A square-box base appeared **2**. Base-on-base, right?

  

Wrong. The lowest point of Base Two — 62.28 **3** — did not fall as low as the upper reach of Base One, which had a 60.14 high. No base on base.

  

In fact, you could argue that the stock was simply pulling back to its 10-week moving average line, offering a new buy point, and not a proper base at all.

  

When Under Armour reached 80 before correcting again, it definitely made its 20% gain from the original breakout at 60.24.

  

The new base that followed was later stage. Always remember: The higher the base count, the more likely the stock is to fail.

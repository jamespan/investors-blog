*Dear Millennial:*


I am stoked. (Did I just date myself?) I am glad you — and readers of older and even younger generations — check out this column to see what you can learn.


Why? You want to earn some extra money. You are intrigued about the stock market. You are a big fan of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and its amazing shows.


Good. Now consider this: If you follow companies whose products or services are loved by your friends and family members, you definitely are on to something. Some investment pros in the business, such as former star Fidelity mutual fund manager and "One Up on Wall Street" author Peter Lynch, believe you have an edge. You may know more about a product than anyone on Wall Street.


Being a savvy consumer gives you an edge in the art and game of stock investing. But don't fly blind.


Don't just buy some shares in a stock and then resume your binge-watching on Netflix or YouTube. To really be stock-smart, learn to gain insights from a **stock chart**, preferably both a daily and weekly. Why? You'll know the right time to buy and the right time to step away.


Let's look at the early-December attempt by Netflix to blast off to new highs. IBD has researched the best U.S. market winners going back to the 1880s. Many of them formed the **cup pattern**, shaped by investors' emotions of hope, greed, fear and exhaustion. It then broke out to new highs and market-beating advances. Netflix did so several times from 2009 to 2011.


So, why did Netflix's latest breakout flop? And could you have spotted the reasons early?


Yes. Many cup bases form in the market. Many are poorly formed. Avoid those that show the same flaws as Netflix.


**![ICnflx090516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ICnflx090516.jpg)Flaw 1**: See the wild swings just weeks into its new correction **(1)**. In the week ended Aug. 21, Netflix slid 15%. The next week, it catapulted 13% -- and in that same week, the weekly price range was an insane 39.5%. (Weekly high minus weekly low, divide by the low, multiply by 100.) Those weren't the only wild weeks. After the August 2015 flash crash, Netflix showed at least six more week of weekly swings exceeding 10%, two of which were severe declines **(2)**.


When a good cup forms, it shows areas of tight, quiet price action. Why? You want to see strong gains, but you also want to see few instances of fund managers and other members of the big money selling stock like mad. So, study each week's action in the base. Get a feel for whether the action is wide and loose (bad) or tight (usually good). Whip out your calculator if you have to. Don't simply trust what you see on the screen.


**Flaw 2**: A 7-for-1 split took place right before the base began to form. Excessive splits indicate tremendous optimism by management and can flag a top as the market floods with a new supply of shares.


**Flaw 3**: While Netflix spent heavily to invest in future growth, its profit has suffered. Netflix's earnings fell 9%, 8%, 63% and 50% vs. year-ago levels from Q4 of 2014 to Q3 of last year. You want to see earnings growing rapidly when a stock breaks out.


**Flaw 4**: The market was still struggling as Netflix's base formed. When a stock breaks out, check to see if the market is healthy as well. Go to the Market Pulse table, attached to IBD's **[Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/)**. It's best to buy stocks only when the market is in a confirmed uptrend.

**IBD's TAKE**: *Tight trading is one of the key elements of a **[good chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/tight-areas-in-bases-show-accumulation/)**. It means that institutional investors are reluctant to depart the stock. Read more about this element in this **[Investor's Corner column](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/tight-areas-in-bases-show-accumulation/)**.*

Imagine driving a car and never checking the gas gauge, the coolant temperature, the oil dipstick or the tire pressure. Yet, that's the approach some folks take when investing. Price is all they care about. They ignore volume, even though it's often more important to decision-making than price is.




Volume matters greatly in stock indexes and in individual growth stocks.


What sort of insights can an investor get from the volume data? Let's look at a few situations.


* The stock price is declining: If a stock pulls back in quiet volume, this suggests funds are not dumping shares. But if the stock falls in heavy volume, this points to serious institutional selling.

Consider a stock that rides above its 50-day moving average or 10-week line for weeks, but then pulls back to the 50-day line. Volume will tell the investor whether the decline is troubling or nothing to worry about. If the stock can bounce off its 50-day line in strong volume, that's positive action.


Savvy investors like to make their [secondary purchases near the 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) when they are bullish on a stock.


* The stock price is rising: If volume is quiet as a stock makes a new high, especially after a long run-up, this could be a [sign of weakness](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-why-new-highs-in-low-volume-can-halt-a-big-run/). Individual latecomers may be buying shares, but funds may have become cautious.


Generally, big volume as a stock advances is a bullish sign. (The exception is a [climax run](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/).)


* The stock shows stalling action: If a winner attracts heavy volume without further price progress, this is a sign of unusually strong institutional selling. Funds are selling into the rally.


This is also true of stock indexes. [Stalling action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) is a sign of distribution.


* Up/down volume: If a stock's [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) is either above or below the neutral 1.0, draw the appropriate conclusion: A high rating points to fund buying, a low rating to fund selling.


Growth Stocks And Their Breakouts

What about [stock breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/)? Strong volume is critical in a [stock breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). IBD research has determined that a breakout needs a volume increase of 40% above the stock's average volume.


A volume increase of that sort points to institutional buying.


What about [the current market](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/)? Check the weekly chart. Nasdaq volume has declined in the three weeks ending May 17, May 24 and May 31, and prices also have fallen.


The situation would be more dire if volume was building during the Nasdaq's price decline.


In July/August 2017, similar action developed **(1)**. Afterward the Nasdaq advanced almost 17% in 21 weeks.


Among individual stocks, look at the volume since Christmas in **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)). High volume weeks mostly occurred on the down side.



The stock was sending a message all the way during its 50% decline.

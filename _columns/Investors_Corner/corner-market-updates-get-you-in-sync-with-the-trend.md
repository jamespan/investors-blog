"So, how are you?"

  

When a stranger or friend greets you with those four words, they're not asking for your medical records, your financial statements or a list of everything you did in the past 24 hours.

  

A brief reply will do: You're fine, or a bit bummed, or you're about to donate your vital organs to science.

  

"So, how's the market?"

  

The proper answer to that question is pretty much the same. The market is fine, wrestling with something, or headed to hell on rails.

  

Following the market isn't as complicated as some people make it out to be. You don't need 42 indicators and a deck of tarot cards.

  

Sure, stock research and studying charts take time. But that's not what we're talking about here.

  

Reading "The Big Picture" takes maybe 10 minutes. But that's also not what we're talking about here.

  

Then what are we talking about?

  

We're talking about how you follow the market intraday. How often do you read a market roundup? Where's the balance between too much detail and too little?

  

The market updates at Investors.com try to find the balance. Updates are posted eight times daily.

  

You may have noticed that the Investor.com updates are different than the updates that come from other sources.

  

Investors.com's updates often revolve around top-rated stocks, not old companies that have ceased to be relevant. When possible, the focus is on stocks breaking out, or flashing sell signs. The idea is to provide useful information.

  

General media updates and Investors.com updates both discuss the trend of the day. But the general media often ignore volume, a critical component. They also see cause and effect where it may not exist.

  

For example, after the last earnings report by **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), some general media reports suggested Cisco's weak outlook was the reason for the market's early struggles the next day. Granted, Cisco is 2% of the Nasdaq composite's makeup. But was Cisco spreading a marketwide flu?

  

Well, three of every four network stocks rose that day. How do we know that? IBD's market writers use a variety of sophisticated tools, including MarketSmith, that can sort industry groups and other categories that put things in a context.

  

On a recent day, an Investors.com update noted that **OmniVision Technologies** ([OVTI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OVTI)) was trying to clear a buy point. On another day, a report flagged a breakout by **NetScout Systems** ([NTCT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTCT)).

  

Here are a few additional tips:

  

•Don't focus on intraday charts, or you'll overtrade.

  

•Cut down your intake of opinions. Some subjectivity is unavoidable. You'll get enough by accident.

  

•Don't go on vacation and ignore your stocks. If you do, your vacation could cost you more than you ever imagined.

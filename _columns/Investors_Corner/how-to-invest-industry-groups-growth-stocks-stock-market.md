Growth stocks gain attention on the stock market in any number of ways. But they tend to travel in industry groups. And industry groups have, for decades, been a focal point of research at Investor's Business Daily.

Industry group information is scattered throughout Investors.com and IBD Weekly. At [Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/), the [Stock Quote page](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nyse-kirkland-lake-gold-ltd-kl.htm?fromsearch=1) includes a stock's industry and the industry group ranking listed under the "Company Fundamentals" column. In the IBD weekly print publication, the ranking of each IBD 50 growth stock's industry group (from 1st to 197th) is just to the right of the company name at the top of the mini-chart.

You can find the top 40- and worst 40-ranked industries listed just below the Nasdaq and S&P 500 charts on the General Market Indicators information page. At Investors.com, see it as a daily PDF page at the end of each part of [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).

But the epicenter of IBD's industry research is the "[Industry Group Rankings](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-19-2018/)" page at investors.com, and the more detailed industry group information available [at IBD Marketsmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF). These lay out the group rankings, composite ratings and other factors related to the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.

## Growth Stocks, Industry Groups And The Stock Market

[IBD founder William J. O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) made industry-level study a central focus based on early company research that showed more than 35% of the strength of a winning stock's advance owed to the strength of its industry group at the time of its [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Another 10% to 15% of that same stock's strength was linked to the strength of the overall sector. The combination meant as much as 50% of a stock's strength is tied to industry group and sector attributes at the time of its breakout.

Industry groups are ranked according to a number of factors. Most important: six-month relative price strength. This gauges the collective price performance of stock in the industry against all others.

A great many things that occur within an economy take place at the industry level. Regulations shift. Supply and demand wax and wane. Labor and raw material prices rise and fall. New technologies or business modes arrive to place pressure on traditional competitors.

These are a few of the fundamental reasons that leading growth stocks generally move in groups. On the technical side, investor capital often flows according to industry. Many index and other types of funds specifically distribute investment at the industry level. The [key for CAN SLIM-style investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) is to pinpoint growth stocks that are gaining strength, with [promising chart traits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/), within a strong or improving industry.

## Pinpoint The Best Growth Stocks In An Industry

A trick to finding industries which are gaining strength is to go to the [Industry Group Rankings](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-dec-19-2018/) page at investors.com. Scan down the left side columns of the top 50 industries, and look for which groups have made the largest advances over the past three and six-week periods.

The current giant step leader is Mining — Gold/Silver/Gems. The 63-stock group jumped to a No. 24 ranking at the end of Thursday trading, up from 133rd three weeks ago and a No. 160 position at the start of November. This is a sort of de facto gauge of relative strength, showing which stocks are running up faster than others.

A simple way to hunt for which stocks in the group are promising is to go to Investors.com and type "gold miners" into the search window. This should turn up a long list of stories which mention stocks included in the group. The first story about a specific gold miner growth stock is [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch: Will This Top Growth Stock Strike It Rich?](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-kirkland-lake-gold/) The article discusses **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), which is currently the [top growth stock pick](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-kirkland-lake-gold-ltd-kl.aspx) in the group.

The art of investing could be summed up in one sentence: Make sure you stay on the smart side of a shakeout. If you can do that, then success is likely.




A shakeout involves a rush to the exits by investors who suffered a long price decline in a stock and now can break even or perhaps make a small profit. Many rookie investors can tell stories about the stock they sold just before it soared.


The shakeout in top stocks often appears just before the smart money begins to scoop up shares.


How can an investor get on the right side of a shakeout?


A [good stock chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) is the best way to get a clear view of what's happening in a stock.


Check The Chart In Top Stocks For A Shakeout
--------------------------------------------


There are at least three ways to create a stock shakeout. A stock that suffers a long decline — a year and a half to two years or more — will shake out impatient investors. With the shakeout accomplished, investors can often spot a 30% prior uptrend and an [excellent base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) that leads to an [outstanding breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Top stocks that sketch a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) will shake out the weaklings when the second low undercuts the first low. Watch for the undercut in the W-shaped pattern.


A top stock that forms a [cup with handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) will conduct a shakeout on the right side of the base. The low-volume [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) is the sign of weak holder selling. The [high-volume breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) is the sign of smart money moving into the stock.


How To Invest: Chipotle's Shakeout Story
----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ICcmg042219-249x300.jpg)Restaurant chain **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) provides a unique shakeout story.


The stock began declining in October 2015. With minor rebound attempts that essentially failed, the stock didn't reach a bottom until February 2018.


The more than two-year decline served as a shakeout. A final consolidation formed from January 2018 through late April 2018. The stock broke past a 345.98 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Given the long decline, few weak holders hung around to spoil the breakout. The stock gapped up 24% on April 26, 2018, and eventually rose 37% by mid-August.


A consolidation followed. Chipotle sketched a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). The [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was 501.08. Chipotle broke out in the week ended Jan. 11 of this year, no doubt helped by the second leg's shakeout.


In just five weeks, the stock had risen 42% (543.90) from the base's second low (383.20). The quick gains had to worry any remaining weak holders. Chipotle formed a handle at 543.90 to 519.09, offering a new entry at 544. [The handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), which formed above the base's left-side high, reflected another small shakeout.


Spotting The Shakeout
---------------------



A Feb. 7 breakout past the handle involved an 11% gain in volume soaring 471% above normal pace.


The stock is now [too extended](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) to buy.


Note how the shakeouts formed several opportunities for Chipotle bulls. Spotting the shakeout made success possible.

Some of the best technical indicators are the simplest ones, such as the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Count the relative strength line as another one.




The relative strength line's job is nothing more difficult than to tell you how a stock is performing compared with the general market. Straightforward as it sounds, it's an important tool for finding winning stocks and ETFs.


The line measures the price performance of a stock or ETF and compares it to the S&P 500. When shares outperform the S&P 500, the line trends higher. When shares lag the S&P, the line trends lower.


By now you may be thinking, "Well, what's so special about that? The line will just follow the stock price." Actually, there's a lot more to it.


Because it compares stocks to the broad market, the RS line is great at identifying true leaders. And some stocks trading near new highs could be fooling you if their RS lines are drooping.


When a leading stock climbs above a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/), it's bullish if the RS line also makes a new high. In fact, if the line makes new highs before the breakout, that's especially savory.


When we say new high, it's not necessarily an all-time high. If the line makes a new high for the duration of a stock's basing period, that's sufficient.


In a slumping stock market, the relative strength line is especially helpful in making an early identification of emerging leaders — often those that lead the next market uptrend.


How To Find Relative Strength Line
----------------------------------


In IBD Charts and [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge), the relative strength line is plotted in blue and usually appears below the price bars.

In September, crude oil prices and energy stocks started to outperform the market, as the S&P 500 went into a slump that month. This was a clear case of an industry bucking the market trend thanks to powerful underlying fundamentals.


Devon, an oil and gas exploration and production company based in Oklahoma, had been forming a base since June. For 15 weeks, the stock consolidated while the company demonstrated its leadership with EPS gains of 650% and 433% reported during that period.


RS Line Confirmed Breakout
--------------------------


The stock broke out Sept. 23, 2021, past the 30.41 buy point of a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) **(1)**. Volume surged 47% above average, a good sign.


Even more impressive was the relative strength line, which was picking up momentum and made a new high the day after the breakout **(2)**. This was a solid sign that the stock was in favor among institutional investors.


Devon shares soared 48.6% to a peak on Nov. 24 — a tidy profit for those who saw the RS line and other chart signals.

  Tight Areas In Bases Show Accumulation

Your goal when analyzing a base is to determine if the stock is under accumulation. Let's say the market is in a correction, and the leading stocks are declining alongside the major indexes. Institutional investors use the correction as an opportunity to buy or pick up additional shares of a name they believe has great potential.

  

The big money managers don't want other hotshots scalping profits by trading ahead of them, so they keep their buying and selling confidential. But they can't hide from the charts what they're doing.

  

We don't know who they are, but we can see what they're doing. It shows up in the price and volume action of the chart.

  

One quiet sign of accumulation is tight areas of trading. On a weekly chart, they appear as small price variations from low to high for the week. Over several weeks, the stock finishes unchanged or remarkably near the previous week's close. This can go on for weeks as the money manager builds a large position.

  

Tight areas are particularly critical near the bottom of a base.

  

Let's study the weekly chart of IT services giant **Cognizant Technology** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)). The Nasdaq began a correction in January that would take it down 19% to as low as 1750 by August 2004, nearly a bear market decline.

  

Cognizant, which had outperformed the indexes since the end of 2001, ultimately corrected 31% from its early 2004 peak of 28.59 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in June that year). But by May, while the rest of the market continued to decline, Cognizant mounted a comeback. It formed a double bottom with a handle.

  

Three times during the base-building process, Cognizant formed tight areas and narrow weekly price closes. The first instance, which occurred during the weeks ended March 19 and March 26, was especially noteworthy **(1)**.

  

In the week ended May 7, Cognizant dropped just 1%. The next week, it fell 1.8% but ended in the upper 60% of the weekly price range, a sign of accumulation **(2)**.

  

Cognizant etched another tight area running for three weeks in the handle **(3)**. The stock broke out past a 26.69 buy point July 27. Volume rose 65% above average.

  

Investors were forced to endure a pullback that took the stock 10% below a 26.74 buy point **(4)**, a tall order given investors should cut losses at 7%-8%. But they could have bought it back when it recovered.

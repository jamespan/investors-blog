When the U.S. stock market bottomed in the fourth quarter of 1974, the country and the economy were in an utterly sour state.


For stock investors today, that piece of market history serves up a timeless lesson: Don't wait for the economy to pick up and then speed up before you decide to deploy your own cash and make new buys.


The market leads the economy. So keep an open mind and accept a strong follow-through as your timing signal. Then, no matter how you feel, find a highly rated stock that breaks out of a sound base to new highs.


Don't dilly-dally. If you lack the courage to invest when most folks are depressed or disillusioned about stocks, you might suffer from mental inertia and never take the plunge.


The oil embargo by OPEC in late 1973 whipped up inflation, and the U.S. economy fell into stagnation. By March 1974, crude oil futures quadrupled in price to \$12 a barrel. Meanwhile, newly industrialized countries knocked American manufacturers to the ropes. Many companies went through painful restructurings.


The U.S. recession lasted long, from November 1973 to March 1975. Joblessness hit 9% two months afterward.


Yet the stock market bottomed out and rallied well before the economy as a whole did. On Oct. 4, 1974, the S&P 500 logged an up day **(1)** to 62.34, ending a nine-session losing skid. Three days later, in nearly the blink of an eye, the large-cap benchmark notched a follow-through **(2)**, rising 4.6% in sharply higher volume **(3)**.


About a month after the follow-through, the S&P 500 started retreating. But it held above the Oct. 4 low and resumed its climb.


Coal stocks led from October 1974 to December 1977. Demand for coal spiked as America suffered from severe gasoline shortages. Falcon Seaboard rose 997% in 168 weeks after its breakout.


Catalog showrooms reinvented retailing with their time- and space-saving concept. Consumers appreciated the selection and low prices. Service Merchandise — where this writer bought his first album, the "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack — rallied 586% over a 139-week run.


One could not ignore the oil-exploration and oil-services firms that dominated the buying during market rallies of the mid-1970s. Houston Oil romped 460% in 79 weeks. You can see its chart on page 144 of IBD Chairman William O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks" (4th ed.).

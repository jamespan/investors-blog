You're not supposed to judge someone by the way he or she looks, but in investing you should do just that.


When hunting for stocks in proper bases, two positive traits are smooth price action and symmetry. Having both in your target stocks will give you a better shot at a successful trade.


What is smooth price action?


It's the opposite of wild and loose trading. When a stock is forming, say, the left side of a base, it declines in a controlled, even gentle, fashion. Not every week within the base has to show mild action. But smoothness signals that professionals are supporting the stock and steadily building their positions.


Armed with millions of dollars to put to work, institutions spread their buying out over a period of time. This can last weeks or longer. Because of their size, they can't enter a stock all at once without running up the price too much.


Smooth price action on the right side of a cup pattern lets you know that institutional buyers are in charge. Price patterns that are all over the place and have spikes to the upside and downside suggest no one has control. Buyers and sellers are still battling it out, which bodes poorly for a future breakout.


When you buy stocks, you want as many variables lined up in your favor as possible.


A proper chart pattern also should show symmetry. Simply put, the base shape should have a balance in proportions. Lopsided price patterns tend to be faulty.


For example, in a cup pattern, the amount of time on the right and left sides should be similar. In a 10-week cup, the low of the pattern should occur at around week five or the halfway point.


In the case of a double-bottom base, both sides should resemble each other. If you're looking at a 12-week double-bottom pattern, the amount of time needed to create both legs should be similar.


If the first leg took six weeks to form, then ideally the second leg should also take about six weeks. It doesn't have to be exact. You just don't want a situation where the first leg formed over two weeks and the second formed over 12 weeks, or vice versa.


After coming public in May 2005, casual clothing retailer **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)) more than doubled before settling into its first base in late July â€” a 13-week double-bottom with a handle buy point at 34.


The base's left side took six weeks **1**, while the right side took seven weeks **2**. The stock broke out in the week ended Nov. 4 and ran up 53% by February 2006 before pulling back to its 10-week line **3**.

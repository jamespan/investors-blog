  Sell Stock Quickly When Late-Stage Breakout Goes Awry

Are you worried that your stock may be about to crash?


One way to conquer, or at least ease, that fear is by reading the technical signals that foreshadow a stock's breakdown. This is especially important for high-growth stocks that have already enjoyed a long run-up, for at some point they will correct sharply or even crash.


One such signal occurs when a stock breaks down from a late-stage base. Learning to recognize and react to this sell signal quickly can be the difference between getting out at or near the top, or watching a sizable chunk of your profits evaporate.


Let's look at property manager **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)), which formed a fifth-stage base starting in early February 2007.


First- or second-stage bases are good; they typically have the best chance of success. But later-stage bases — they don't get much later than fifth-stage — should be viewed with caution as they're more likely to fail.


So how do you know what stage base you're in?


One, go back to the end of the last bear market, when all base counts reset to zero. Two, a stock resets its base count if it cuts below the prior base's lowest intraday price point.


From these low points, count how many times the stock broke out from a proper base and rose at least 20% before shaping the next base. Doing so tells you what stage base your stock is in.


Note that a base that forms before the stock has advanced 20% from the breakout is called a base-on-base, which is counted as a single base.


CBRE went public in June 2004 and broke out from its first base by early September that year. The next base appeared from February to May 2005 **(1)**. That was followed by a third-stage cup-with-handle base starting in early September 2005 and cup-with-handle base beginning in late April 2006 **(2)**.


The fifth-stage base started taking shape in early February 2007 **(3)**. But the pattern was ill-defined. The stock spent many weeks going mostly sideways without a definitive breakout to new high ground. That was a warning sign.


The other signal that all wasn't well came in the week ended July 20, 2007, when the stock hit a new high but then reversed lower and ended at the low end of its trading range in brisk trade. (Please see a weekly chart.) Sure enough, CBRE crashed 13% the very next week in the highest weekly volume in eight months, breaking through its key support lines and triggering IBD's 8% loss-cutting sell rule.


Investors who bought at the fifth-stage breakout and failed to heed that sell signal lost money quickly. And those who had been holding the stock since its IPO saw their hard-won gains from the long uptrend vanish. In October 2008, CBRE had fallen sharply below its IPO price, then fell to a low of 2.34.

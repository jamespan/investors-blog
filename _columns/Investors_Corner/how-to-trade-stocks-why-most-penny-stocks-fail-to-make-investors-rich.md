Think of penny stocks the same way you think of really cheap perfume.




The fact that you could buy 100,000 shares of a 10-cent stock for \$10,000 might sound very enticing. After all, with that many shares in the portfolio, you might feel like a company insider or an institutional-class investor.


The thought that the penny stock just needs to rise another 10 cents to double in price may be like an irresistible cologne or eau de toilette.


The truth? As you learn and master the [rules of IBD-style investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/getting-started/), you quickly learn that a stock's share price is a function of a company's quality and growth record.

In the long run, stocks with higher quality, big institutional support and strong growth will give you consistent results.


Why Penny Stocks Do Not Generate Big Long-Term Profits
------------------------------------------------------


A stock that is trading at 20, 60 or 100 a share or more is attractive to fund managers across the globe. With millions of dollars to invest, each portfolio manager still needs to buy a cartload of shares of such a stock.



Now, let's imagine what it would be like to try to build a \$50 million stake in a company whose shares trade at 20 cents each. The manager would have to accumulate 250 million shares. Few companies have that many shares outstanding, let alone a float that large.


If you spot a stock in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) or in [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) that trades at least 1 million shares a day at 40, it has \$40 million of daily turnover. This allows funds to buy and sell shares smoothly, making less of a serious intraday impact on the price.


Of course, some pros excel at buying and holding stocks that trade for less than a buck or two a share. But even for them, the road to profits is not smooth. Penny stocks are a whole lot closer to becoming financial dust if the underlying company files for bankruptcy.


Even Stock Market Leaders Can Become Penny Stocks
-------------------------------------------------


Do you remember Central European Distribution? (*The company traded under the ticker symbol CEDC before going private and then later winning court approval in May 2013 to restructure financially, wiping out a ton of outstanding long-term debt.*) The exporter of fine wines and liquors and vodka distiller in Poland moved like a hot rod during the 2003-to-2007 bull run. IBD frequently covered the former then-IBD 100 member. In July 2008, the stock traded as high as 77.48.


But after the 2008 bear market, CEDC never made a new high again. On Feb. 26, 2013, the stock fell 77 cents, or 55%, to 62 cents amid a mountain of souring convertible debt. Despite efforts to shore up its finances, CEDC kept falling until its stock was suspended from trading on April 12. On July 8, Nasdaq said it would delist shares of CEDC as well as three more companies.

Care more about the dollar size and quality of your investment, not the sheer number of shares you own.


Suppose you bought \$10,000 worth of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) when it first broke out of a [first stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) on March 4, 2004.


The [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was 24.94, the average volume was 5.7 million shares. That's solid liquidity. So what if you owned just 400 shares? Apple rose 179% to 69.57 by Nov. 29, growing your wad to \$27,900.


The Opposite Of A Penny Stock
-----------------------------


Today, Apple trades near 200, even after a severe slide in the fourth quarter of 2018. Due to a 7-for-1 split in June 2014, the split-adjusted price of the Silicon Valley giant at its March 2004 breakout comes down to 3.56 a share.


Profit and sales surely are not growing at the same clip they did more than a decade ago. But the megacap tech has proven in recent years that it's still capable of churning out steady double-digit EPS and revenue gains. Earnings jumped 11% in fiscal 2017 (ended in September that year) to \$9.21 a share, then accelerated 29% in FY 2018 to \$11.91.


That's remarkable for a company that logged \$265.6 billion in fiscal 2018 revenue, \$11.91 in profit per share, and 4.6 billion shares outstanding.


Apple Stock Today
-----------------


The company, under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook, has vowed to further expand its business in the digital services markets as well as through new products.


The Street currently sees earnings in the current fiscal year ending in September falling just 2% to \$11.67 a share, then rebounding 10% to \$12.83 in FY 2020.


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-inc-aapl.aspx), Apple's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is on the mend. As of Thursday, the RS Rating has improved to a 61 on a scale of 1 (woeful) to 99 (wowza). The best stock market winners on average show an RS Rating of 87 at the start of their big price gains.

  How To Invest: Focus On Market Leaders, Not Laggards

In recent days, you've learned in Investor's [Corner](http://education.investors.com/) that big earnings growth and a new product or service fueling that growth is critical to a stock's success. Gauging supply and demand is also important.

  

The 'L' in CAN SLIM stands for Leader. The definition of a leader and a laggard isn't difficult to understand, but in the stock market it can be a source of confusion. Why? Because industry group laggards are referred to as leaders all the time.

  

Because of its size and brand recognition, **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) is often mentioned as a chip leader even though its performance in 2014 left a lot to be desired. Shares ended the year flat compared to an 11% gain for the S&P 500.

  

Truth is, new leaders have emerged in the Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group but they're not well known.**Avago** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and **NXP** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) lead on strong fundamentals and big market-share gains.

  

IBD's definition of a leader is fairly straightforward. It has strong fundamentals. It shows strong price performance in its group. Leaders also tend to have outstanding mutual fund sponsorship.

  

An industry group laggard is just the opposite. Its share price is going lower because fundamentals are deteriorating. Price performance is hurt because mutual fund managers are no longer interested in owning shares.

  

IBD's Relative Price Strength Rating measures the price performance of a stock against the rest of the market for the past 52 weeks. Stocks are rated on a 1-99 scale. An RS Rating of 99 means the stock's price performance has outperformed 99% of all other stocks.

  

The best strategy is to focus on stocks with RS Ratings in the 80s or 90s that are in proper base patterns. Stocks with RS Ratings below 70 should generally be avoided.

  

IBD's Composite Rating is another way to quickly identify stocks with leadership traits. Stocks with high Composite Ratings generally have outstanding fundamentals and are showing relative price strength.

  

After lengthy uptrends, some leaders maintain high ratings from IBD even though they're in late-stage price runs. Targeting leaders when they're breaking out of early-stage bases is preferable to buying those breaking out after huge price runs already.

  

In recent years, new leaders have emerged in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group. One of them is **NetSuite** ([N](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=N)). The provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) is no stranger to growth with a five-year annualized earnings growth rate of 41% and sales growth rate of 27%.

  

Compare that to Germany-based **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) where earnings and sales growth has slowed dramatically in recent years. Meanwhile, 201 funds owned SAP shares at the end of 2013. Three quarters later, the number dropped to 131.

  

Keep in mind that SAP's market capitalization is around \$80 billion, much more than NetSuite's market cap of \$8 billion. It's a good reminder that leaders tend to be smaller companies. Every company eventually reaches a size where earnings growth starts to slow. SAP is there now. NetSuite isn't there yet.

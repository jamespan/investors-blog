Scouting out potential winners before they take off on a big run isn't easy. But IBD helps makes the task a little less daunting with its Composite Rating.

This broad-based metric takes into account IBD SmartSelect Ratings including Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength, Sales + Profit Margins + Return On Equity and Accumulation/Distribution, then assigns stocks a number ranging from 1 (worst) to 99 (best). How far a stock is from its 52-week high is also factored into the Composite Rating.

A 99 Composite means a stock's combined ratings outperform 99% of all others tracked by IBD.

Keep in mind that just because a stock gets a 99 doesn't mean it's an automatic buy. The Composite Rating offers a good place to start your search for watch-list contenders, since it helps narrow the field. A high grade implies that the stock meets certain fundamental and technical criteria. From there, further due diligence is required, including studying the stock charts as well as company news, industry group action and the overall market.

While a high rating indicates that a stock is an outperformer, you shouldn't limit yourself to just those with a 99 Composite Rating. Many leading stocks will not have a 99 when they break out. So if you look only at those, your pool of candidates will not just be tiny, it might also include stocks that are already extended in price. An [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/782978-3-perfect-score-stocks.htm?ntt=perfect+score) column late last year looking at three stocks with 99s for their Composite, EPS and RS ratings proved this point.

That's why it's important to use IBD's SmartSelect Ratings as one component of your stock-picking routine, not as a way to avoid doing further digging. Filtering for stocks that earn a Composite Rating of say, 90 or better, will leave you with a solid list of companies to delve into for your watch list. Always check the daily and weekly charts too, to see if a stock is basing and where potential buy points are, and to analyze price and volume action.

You can find the Composite Rating in the stock tables each day, in any of the mini stock charts in the paper, and on Stock Checkup at Investors.com.

**Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) can help illustrate why it's tough to catch a winning stock based solely on its ratings. The stock was slowing down from a two-year run and moving mostly sideways as it started forming a base in the week ended March 15, 2013. It went on to shape a nine-week cup with handle, with a buy point at 60.30.

Shares broke out in the week ended May 24 and surged 193% through late February 2014, when they paused to digest the big gains and work on a new base. It's important to note that the broader market was in the midst of a multiyear run-up. What kind of fundamentals did Jazz sport at its breakout?

When the narcolepsy drug maker cleared the entry on May 21 in above-average trade, its SmartSelect Ratings were somewhat of a mixed bag: 95 Composite, 99 Earnings Per Share and 63 Relative Strength. An A SMR and B Accumulation/Distribution checked out. But investors screening for stocks with a 98 or 99 Composite would have missed Jazz, as would have those who looked at just its ho-hum RS Rating.

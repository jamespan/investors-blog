Keeping losses small in a stock when things don't go as planned is one of the best rules to adhere to when investing.


The math is tough to overcome if a loss is allowed to spiral out of control. Remember, if a stock falls 50%, it needs to rally 100% just to get back to even. That's a tall order.


One of the flagship IBD sell rules is to cut a loss in a stock when it hits 7% to 8%. The percentage isn't arbitrary. It came out of years of research that showed growth stocks breaking out bases that fell 7%-8% below the buy point rarely went on to be big market leaders. In fact, many turned into laggards.


While it's important to adhere to the rule because it prevents catastrophic losses for a portfolio, there are times when cutting a loss before it hits 7%-8% makes sense, especially when distribution days start to mount in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, or when breakouts start to run into trouble.


Just recently, the Nasdaq showed nine distribution days along with six for the S&P 500. That's a high count and indicative of institutional selling. It's been a headwind for breakouts, which have been a mixed bag at best. Remember, breakouts need institutional buying power for success. During the summer doldrums, institutional investors aren't exactly chomping at the bit to put money to work.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ICnvda082817.png)With some breakouts working and some not, cutting losses at 3%-4% is sound strategy.


Stocks either act right or don't act right after a breakout. Acting right means the stock generally does a good job holding gains, trading tightly and not giving up much ground. A stock doesn't act right when it shows volatile, whipsaw price action after a breakout. A heavy-volume decline one day after a breakout would be a cue to keep the stock on a tight leash and cut losses at 3%-4%. Also, a gap down in heavy volume soon after a breakout is abnormal price action, especially when a modest gain turns into a loss in one fell swoop.


Other times, it makes sense to cut losses sooner than normal if a breakout just can't get going. A stock might break out, then stay inside the 5% buy zone for an inordinate amount of time. It doesn't make any more headway, then starts to pull back. In this case, you've given the stock plenty of time to work, but it's having a hard time getting out of its own way.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) recently cleared a 168.60 buy point in light volume but could only muster a 3.5% gain before pulling back. It was recently below the buy point and seeking support at the 10-week moving average. New buyers around 168.60 might consider keeping losses limited to 3%-4% in this name, especially if it gives up support at the 10-week line.


Also keep in mind that if you're finding that you're having to cut losses more frequently, take that as a message from the market to take your foot off the pedal when it comes to new buys.


In the early stages of a new bull market, after a meaningful pullback for the major stock indexes, the likelihood of having to cut losses short after a breakout lessen. That's because the early stages of a new bull market is when fresh institutional money is coming in from the sidelines in spades.

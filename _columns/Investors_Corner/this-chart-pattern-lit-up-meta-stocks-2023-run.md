Though perhaps the least exciting pattern in terms of taxonomy, a flat base pattern can return profits as well as any other base structure.

A flat base is a shallow formation. From its peak, the stock will not fall more than 15%. If the depth exceeds 15%, you may have another type of pattern, such as a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), or what [MarketSurge pattern recognition](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) will simply identify as a consolidation.

The sideways, rangebound action of a flat base may appear dull at first glance but can be a sign of continuing institutional demand.

## Identifying The Flat Base

A flat base commonly occurs after a stock has already advanced 20% or more from a previous base. As the stock digests gains and investors begin to take profits, institutional investors are there to purchase it. Big money — such as mutual funds, pension funds, or hedge funds — are slowly accumulating shares. That keeps the stock from falling too much.

For at least five weeks, this process creates a relatively tight area of both support and resistance.

Institutional investors want to avoid paying above a certain price and will wait for the price to drift back down. In doing so, investors get shaken out because they lose patience rather than because of a sharp drop in price.

Without a rapid increase in price, they pull out and search for other growth stocks in which to put their money.

Though most commonly found as a [second- or third-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/), a flat base is no slouch when it comes to first-stage bases.

The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/) is the highest price at the start of the pattern. Look for volume to jump at least 40% when the stock crosses above that level.

## Meta Stock Flattened Out Before Running Up

![meta platforms](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IC100923-300x167.jpg)Facebook parent **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) fell 73% during the 2022 bear market. Its rebound was well underway by the start of 2023, but Meta had yet to present a clear-cut entry.

Following February's earnings report, Meta stock shot up nearly 23% **(1)**. Between the announcement of a new division focused on AI incorporation and deeming 2023 the "Year of Efficiency," CEO Mark Zuckerberg managed to quell investor's fears. The stock needed to cool off after such a big rally. But Meta corrected only 15% **(2)** in the five weeks that followed.

In the week ended March 17, Meta stock cleared the 197.16 buy point with support at the 10-week moving average in volume 51% above average **(3)**. This run would last four months until the stock topped out in late July for a 65% gain.

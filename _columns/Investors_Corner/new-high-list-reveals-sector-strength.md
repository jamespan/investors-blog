CAN SLIM investors like to buy high and sell higher. That makes IBD's New High List a profitable place to shop each day.

But first, a word of caution. Although some stocks hit buy points as they go to new 52-week highs, others should be bought sooner. That's because the ideal place to buy is when a stock clears the handle in a cup-with-handle base or the middle peak of a double-bottom base by a dime.

Also, a stock should never be bought just because it's on the New High List. The stock might also be extended in price, shaking you out in a normal correction. Also, no purchase should be made without analyzing the stock's chart and understanding the company's fundamentals.

That said, some stocks showing up on the list are buyable that day. IBD's New High List, today on Page B11, also offers valuable and time-saving features found nowhere else.

You don't have to wade through the junk. Stocks that are priced under 10 a share and with EPS Ratings under 60 are excluded.

Stocks with EPS Ratings of 90 or better are boldfaced.

Another helpful feature is that the new highs are organized by sectors. You can learn a lot about what's going on in the market by just glancing at how the sectors are organized. Sectors with the most stocks making new highs are listed first.

For example, the Medical sector has sat at or near the top of the New High List on an almost daily basis in recent weeks. Building, Energy and Retail have also generally been prominent on the list.

You can quickly grasp the pattern. Medical stocks are leading the market, and energy stocks and retailers are close behind. When sectors rotate, as they sometimes do with speed and surprise, it should show up on IBD's New High List. While others scratch their heads wondering what happened, you understand, and react accordingly.

Stocks within each sector are sorted by percentage volume increase.

Take the newspaper of Oct. 12, 2013. Looking down the list, you see the Transportation sector and see **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) at the top of the list and boldfaced with a 95 EPS Rating.

Miramar, Fla.-based Spirit had gapped up out of a base the previous day, rising 15% on volume 315% above average. It's made a sizable gain. Along the way, the stock presented new opportunities to pick up shares.

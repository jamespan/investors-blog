If you are looking for ways to invest in the needs and wants of millennials, it makes sense to evaluate real estate investment trusts (REITs) that focus on multiunit rental housing. But the CEO of an Austin-based real estate firm believes the focus should not be so narrow.

Why? The baby boomers — that is, Americans born from the end of World War II in 1945 to the mid-1960s — are also thinking to rent, not buy.

"An underlying theme reported by the 2015 census report is that baby boomers are becoming the fastest growing renter demographic in the country," Yuen Yung, CEO of the non-traded REIT Upside Avenue, told IBD in an interview by email. "They are renting in both the senior living and traditional apartment markets."

## Don't Invest In Just Millennials

Industry experts note that millennials who are not ready to buy homes have boosted the country's renter population. But Yung says market research forecasts show more than 5 million baby boomers are likely to rent their next residence by the year 2020. Add the fact that Generation Z has just begun to enter college, and you've possibly got a perfect storm of demand for rental apartments.

"Over 4.6 million new rental units are needed by 2030 to meet projected demand," Yung said. "This massive influx of new renters will only continue to increase the demand within multifamily markets."

Yung thinks Texas and Florida will likely provide solid long-term returns. Why? These states attract both companies and workers with a positive business climate and low or zero taxes. He adds "there will always be opportunities in certain cities that also attract companies like Atlanta, Denver, Nashville, or St. Louis, where individual (real estate) deals can be found."

## REIT Stocks Heat Up

The debut of Upside Avenue, which aims at annual returns of 6% to 8%, is timely. Through Wednesday's market close, IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group has vaulted from 124th to 46th among [197 IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) for six-month relative performance.

Austin-based Casoro Capital launched [Upside Avenue](https://upsideavenue.com/) this past summer. The firm, founded by Monte Lee-Wen, has executed more than \$1 billion in transactions to buy, manage and reposition U.S. commercial property.

## Risks Of Non-Traded REITs

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) warns individuals to carefully review non-traded REITs before investing. On its website, FINRA notes that "early redemption of shares is often very limited, and fees associated with the sale of these products can be high and erode total return."

Upside Avenue REIT requires a one-year minimum holding period. It imposes a penalty of 2% of money invested on redemptions during year two of holding and 1% for year three. After year three, no penalty. Yung says the Upside Avenue product will price annually.

Like exchange-traded REITs, non-traded trusts must distribute at least 90% of all taxable income to shareholders to maintain tax advantages set by the IRS.

## Publicly Traded REITs Are Excelling

As of Wednesday's market close, IBD's REIT leaders stock list shows 12 companies. The list includes **Arbor Realty Trust** ([ABR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABR)) of Uniondale, N.Y. (8.2% annualized yield as of Thursday's trading) to Little Rock-based **Uniti Group** ([UNIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNIT)) (12.5% yield). Arbor buys real estate-related bridge loans, mezzanine loans and first mortgages. The latter owns and leases fiber optic and copper wire cable lines.

Hospital operator **Medical Properties Trust** ([MPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPW)) has snagged [a spot in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) as software and other tech leaders have corrected sharply this fall.

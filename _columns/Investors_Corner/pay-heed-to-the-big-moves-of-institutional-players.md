Isaac of Nineveh became an Eastern Orthodox saint even though he ignored every theological dispute of his time. If you observe silence, he wrote, "inexpressible light will dawn upon you."


Isaac might have made a fantastic money manager.


Filtering out market noise is essential if you seek to stick to right action. But what is right action?


Right action in investing involves three things. First, you must zero in on the price and volume action of the market. Second, you must zero in on a stock's fundamentals and chart action. Third, you must ignore almost everything else.


Substance Vs. Fluff
-------------------


What should you ignore?


When your gasbag uncle says he works with a guy who knows of a company about to snare a big government contract, that's not information. It's rumors and noise.


When a pundit declares a potential investment "stupid" because of concerns that historically have had no impact on a stock's action, that's not a well-reasoned observation. It's sound and fury.


When an analyst touts an "undervalued" stock because of its low price-earnings ratio and bad-mouths an "overvalued" rival with a high P-E, that's not a research-driven view. It's dogma.


These sorts of things should be ignored. By ignore, we don't mean hear it and dismiss it. We mean excuse yourself from the gasbag's presence, turn the page, switch the TV off -- as soon as you grasp what's coming. You don't want insidious and useless suggestions burrowing into your brain like a pig tapeworm.


Listen to the market and study stocks in silence. Try to get a pure take on reality.


Now if you pay attention to detail, you probably noticed in paragraph five we said to ignore almost everything else.


What escapes the almost-everything category?


Institutional buying and selling is something you should monitor. True, the price and volume action of a stock will point to accumulation or distribution. The up-down volume ratio also can be useful.


But you also should determine how many funds owned a stock in the most recently reported quarters, whether quality funds own the stock, and whether the trend in ownership is up or down.


Yes, this information is dated but it's still useful. You want to be aware of broad trends in ownership, even if you can't possess detailed knowledge in real time.


The War For Profits
-------------------


So, why does IBD ignore pundits and market analysts but watch fund managers? Fund managers are like warriors. They determine the outcome of the battle.


They don't bad-mouth a stock. They sell it. They don't bloviate over a stock. They buy it.


Their actions are worth watching because funds have the buying and selling power to move a stock up or down in a sustained fashion.


**[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)** at Investors.com lists the percentage change in funds owning a stock in the latest quarter, and quarters of increasing fund ownership, as seen in the "Supply And Demand" section of IBD Stock Checkup. MarketSmith (accessible via the home page at Investors.com) shows the number of funds holding shares for the past eight quarters. Finally, IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating gives you a sense of whether the funds are net buyers or sellers of an equity. You can see this rating at IBD Stock Checkup.

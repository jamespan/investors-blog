This poker story may help you become a better player in the game of buying growth stocks.

A colleague of mine in IBD's main office shared an episode in a recent game. Jim has won many small tournaments. He has shown a strong sense of the game's mathematical probabilities and player psychology.

In one Texas hold'em game, Jim is dealt a pair of kings. Jim decides to go all in. One opponent decides to call, shoving all his chips into the middle of the table.

The players turn over their cards. Jim's foe shows an ace and 9. As far as probabilities go, Jim clearly has the edge. The flop comes down: ace, ace, ace. Jim ultimately loses the hand.

In Jim's mind, when the stakes are so big, you simply do not call with that kind of hand. But although he played smart, he still lost the hand.

What does this have to do with IBD-style investing?

Sometimes, you can do everything right, and still get hooked for a loss. In cards and in the market, chance and luck do matter. Luck, in fact, plays a significant role in market success — even at the highest level of professional money management.

But that doesn't mean you stop playing smart.

To win big in the stock market, keep focusing on younger companies with big increases in earnings and sales. Focus your capital on the stocks that rise faster than the rest in a good market and fall less than you would expect in a bad one.

And, like Jim, don't give up. Don't let a small loss in a great stock prevent you from buying back at a better time.

Persistence paid off for those who got burned by **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) back in early 2005.

In 2004, EPS soared 92%; sales rose 118%. Yet Google nicked investors who bought on the Jan. 3 breakout past a 201.70 cup-without-handle base, as it slid 7% in three days **(1)**.

Two more breakout attempts over the next four weeks — one on Jan. 18 **(2)** and another on Feb. 2 **(3)** — proved unprofitable.

The big score arrived on April 22. (That breakout is not visible on the graph above, but you can see it on a historical chart.) Google soared 6% in heavy trade and took out a 216.90 buy point — higher than the original 201.70 entry.

The firm's Q1 earnings per share showed the quality of quadruple aces, rising 143% vs. a year ago. The stock ran up 47% by July, and hit 446.21 by year's end.

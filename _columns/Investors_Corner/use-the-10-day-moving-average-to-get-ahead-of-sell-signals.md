Mastering the skill of when to sell stocks takes time, experience and the use of good stock charts. Is there a way to take profits on a stock before it makes one more key sell signals? The short answer is yes.




One way is to sell once your [profit reaches 20% to 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/). Stocks tend to consolidate for at least several weeks after climbing that much from a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). A less clear-cut but effective way is to use the 10-day moving average.


This is a short-term price indicator that tracks the closing prices over the past 10 sessions. ([All daily charts in Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) draw the 10-day line in purple.) Generally speaking, it can lead to more false signals than, say, a 50-day moving average. Yet, there's value in using the 10-day line for the purpose of locking in profits. Here's how it works.


Let's say you buy a stock at a proper buy point and it advances a few percentage points from the entry, just like it should. Watch how the stock acts in relationship to the 10-day average. As long as it doesn't make a serious break of the line, you should continue to hold.

If your gain from the buy point exceeds 20%, consider a break of the line not just a chance to take profits but a sell signal. If the general market is weak, you may treat such a break as a sell signal when the profit is less than 20%. A break that occurs below the buy point is a [sure sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/).


When To Sell Stocks: Using The 10-Day Line
------------------------------------------


In 2016, **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), the Chinese online gaming company, offered a good example on how to use this principle.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ICntes052917-1024x543.png)


The stock broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) June 29, clearing the 179.20 entry **(1)**. Volume was unimpressive, but picked up the next day. That told investors their purchase at the buy point had a good chance of working.


NetEase continued advancing and gave shareholders little trouble. Shares held above the 10-day moving average for months, aside from a few minor penetrations of the line in mild volume. Even on Aug. 18, when volume was more than 2-1/2 times normal following an earnings report, the stock pared losses and closed above the 10-day line **(2)**. That should have been a relief to shareholders.


On Sept. 26, NetEase closed below the 10-day and volume was higher than normal **(3)**. That was the first signal to take profits, which by then had reached a handsome 35%. Shares didn't top until about three weeks later, when the signal became more pronounced. NetEase closed clearly below the 10-day line and continued lower the next day in big volume. A bearish reversal added to the topping behavior **(4)**.


If investors didn't sell three weeks earlier, this was the time to do it. NetEase started a price consolidation of 17 weeks.

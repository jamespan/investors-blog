Short selling is the practice of selling borrowed shares of a stock in hopes of buying it back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.


The stock market's natural upward bias makes short-selling extremely risky, so it's important to know when stocks are poised to fall â€” and keep falling.


If there are golden rules for short sellers, one is this: Short only those stocks that have risen 300% to 400% or more in price.


Growth stocks sometimes appear to be breaking down after posting only modest gains, but they may just be taking a breather before turning around and resuming their climb. Such action saddles short sellers with losses.


Consider this warning from IBD founder William J. O'Neil, who wrote in "How to Make Money In Stocks" that short selling "rarely works out well. Usually the stock that you sell short, expecting a colossal price decrease, will do the unexpected and begin to creep up in price."


Once you've found a big winner, look for symptoms that the stock is breaking down. These typically include a failed breakout from a [late-stage base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/788166-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) or a classic topping pattern such as a [head and shoulders](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/052915-754890-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm).


In each case, look for wild price action as institutional investors start to bail out.


A break of the 50-day or 10-week lines in heavy volume gives short sellers the green light. Ideally, such stocks should have weak Relative Strength and Accumulation/Distribution ratings, indicating heavy institutional selling. Also, the market should be in a correction, as a market uptrend tends to lift even the weakest stocks.


**Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)), a maker of 3D printers, showed how tricky yet profitable short selling can be.


A failed breakout from a late-stage base with a 134.10 buy point in the week ended Jan. 3, 2014, was a sign that the stock was topping. Before that, the stock had run up 220% from a 41.85 buy point of a first-stage consolidation cleared in April 2012. Stratasys had also gained 649% from its October 2011 low of 17.88.


Stratasys offered its first short-sale entry in the week ended Jan. 17, when it pierced its 10-week moving average at around 124.22 in heavy volume. At that moment, investors who bought at the January breakout were forced to sell for a 7%-8% loss.


The stock fell fast. Just three weeks later, Stratasys slipped to a low of 102.21, giving traders a brief opportunity to cover for a gain of 21.5%. But the stock quickly rebounded and forced short sellers to cover.


At the time, the market was in a correction and Stratasys' Accumulation/Distribution Rating had plunged to a worst-possible E. But a 70 RS Rating indicated it still outperformed most listed stocks.


A long, faulty new base formed. Stratasys triggered another short-sale entry by piercing the 10-week line in heavy volume in the week ended Oct. 10 **(1)**. Again the stock rebounded, forcing short sellers to cover.


Finally, the break of the 10-week line near 117.47 in the week ended Nov. 7 provided a nice entry. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. But the stock's 14% plunge that week in huge volume **(2),** an Acc/Dis Rating of D and a 29 RS were signs of a serious breakdown.


From there the stock continued to fall, offering a number of other short-sale entries.

A stock that has been advancing for a long time naturally raises questions when it forms yet another base. Can the good times continue? Is the story too old? Why or when should an investor pass on a new breakout?

  

An investor might look at quarterly earnings and sales for signs of deceleration. The investor might check profit margins to see if they are near highs or at least in line with previous quarters. The quarterly return on equity also should be considered.

  

Those are all fundamentals-related gauges. Yet there's another tool to consider from the technicals side â€” the Relative Strength line. The RS line compares the stock's price action to that of the S&P 500.

  

If a stock breaks out with the RS line moving to a new high, then that is bullish. If the RS line hits a new high before the breakout, that's even better.

  

However, if a stock breaks out but the RS line is not near a new, 52-week high, doubts are natural.

  

Isn't it basic to expect a leader to lead?

  

And if a leader hasn't been outperforming a broad measure like the S&P 500, why should an investor trust the breakout?

  

**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) was in such a situation in 2014. The stock gained 85% from a May 2013 breakout from a long base with a 745.30 entry **(1)**. Then a new base took shape.

  

The RS line had struck a high in February 2014 **(2)**, just before a new base began construction in mid-March. Priceline broke out in early August. Technically, the base count was reset to first-stage when the low of the previous base was undercut in May 2014.

  

Was a first-stage base reason enough to buy the breakout?

  

No, it was not, for two reasons.

  

First, Priceline's fundamentals were changing. In the quarters before the August breakout, revenue growth slowed from 33% to 29% to 26% and again 26%. Earnings growth went from 40% to 31% to 35% and 29%. This wasn't terrible, but again it wasn't ideal.

  

Quarterly after-tax margin slipped from 40.5% to 30.6% to 25.4% and then popped to 31.4%. Perhaps the changes were seasonal. But return on equity in the trailing four quarters dropped for 11 straight quarters from 57.9% to 36.2%.

  

Generally, a growth investor likes to see the fundamentals improving or at least staying the same. Priceline's numbers were suggesting hesitation.

  

Second, after the RS line hit a peak in late February 2014, the line began a choppy decline **(3)**. The stock market was leaving Priceline behind. A growth investor should look for stocks that are outperforming the S&P 500. Why settle for less?

  

When Priceline broke out past 1292.76 on Aug. 4, 2014, volume was heavy. But the RS line was not at a 52-week high. The stock rose less than 3% in the next few sessions and then sank as much as 21% from the buy point in two months.

  

The lagging RS line was a major clue that Priceline had become too tired to run. And if a leader or former leader is too tired to run, it's probably done.

Finding stocks to trade is no easy feat. There are literally thousands to choose from.

  

No, you don't have to pore over all of them. You could just let the Screen Of The Day feature of Investors.com do the heavy lifting for you.

  

Why spend your evenings and weekends going through tons of financial statements and charts when you don't have to? Screen Of The Day will give you potential trade candidates with just a few mouse clicks.

  

Screen Of The Day is a rotating list of 10 different stock screens created by Investors.com staff. A different one appears each trading day. Most of the screens focus on fundamentals, while a couple of them involve sponsorship (institutional ownership) and Relative Strength (a measure of a stock's price success).

  

Among the screens you'll find are those that look for big-cap leaders, small-cap leaders and leading stocks with strong profit margins.

  

The Big Cap Leaders screen on Nov. 20 featured **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) and **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)). All three are institutional-quality stocks.

  

To find Screen Of The Day from the Investors.com home page, just hover your mouse over the Research tab. Then click on Screen Center.

  

Above the screen results, you'll find an article highlighting themes or key events in some of the stocks in each screen.

  

A good way to use Screen Of The Day is to click on the checkmark to pull up a Stock Checkup, which provides a lot of research on the company. Then, click on the chart icon to see the stock's price performance and whether it's in a base or some kind of secondary buy area.

  

If you're satisfied with the stock, you can click on the plus-sign icon to add it to a watchlist on Investors.com and research it further.

  

On Jan. 3, **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) appeared on the Rising Estimates Screen, which looks for leading stocks with big increases in their profit estimates. The screen also has filters for price, volume, Relative Strength, level of accumulation and Composite Rating.

  

3D Systems has been volatile, but it has more than doubled this year. The stock gave investors chances to enter via a couple of bases 1 and tests of its 10-week line 2.

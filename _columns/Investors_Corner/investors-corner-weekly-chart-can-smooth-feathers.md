You don't want temporary factors to shake you out of successful holdings.

  

One method for broader perspective on a stock's status is to study both daily and weekly charts.

  

A daily chart provides many of the stopwatch-level indicators on a stock's health. Both daily and weekly charts offer a range of vital signs late in a stock's run, including climax run and topping signals.

  

But only a weekly chart offers the balance that can temper an overreaction to a stock's daily volatility.

  

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), for example, was beyond a third-stage base and testing support at its 10-week line early in March. It was a week during which IBD's market outlook would shift from "Uptrend under pressure" to "Market in correction."

  

Netflix climbed 4% on Friday, March 4 **1**. The volume was only moderate, but the stock acted as though it wanted to rebound from support at the 10-week line.

  

The general market skidded lower Monday, March 7. Netflix gave up 2% in mild trade, ending just above the 10-week line. On Tuesday, investors flinched: The stock tanked 6% and cut through the 50-day and 10-week lines in heavy trade **2**.

  

The daily chart looked scary â€” a reasonable juncture at which to pare holdings. But investors with a healthy cushion may have opted to wait and see how the chart looked at the end of the week.

  

Shares slipped 1% lower Wednesday. Trade was moderate. On Thursday, Netflix shares jumped 4% in strong volume. They ended just below the 50-day moving average. The stock retook the 50-day line Friday on a 2% gain in slightly below-average volume.

  

On a weekly chart, shares ended down 3%, just below the 10-week line in a third weekly loss. (The 10-week and 50-day lines are slightly different.) But Netflix closed well in the upper half of the week's range and in the stock's best weekly volume since January **3**.

  

It was a hard call. But the added perspective of the weekly chart, and the hint of institutional support, may have been just enough to urge a decision to hold. The stock gained an additional 20% from its close on March 11 and June 17.

  

Other positive signals on weekly charts include tight weekly closes and upside reversals.

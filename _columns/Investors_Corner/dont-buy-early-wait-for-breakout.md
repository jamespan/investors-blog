Sometimes, a stock just looks like it's ready to go. When a stock forms a flat base, characterized by tight, sideways trading in mostly light volume, or a bullish cup-with-handle pattern, astute investors know the chances are good for a breakout.

It's human nature to want to be there early for a breakout. But buying a stock before a base completes is always fraught with risk.

One of the hallmarks of a successful breakout is a surge in volume when the stock passes the buy point. That's the actionable time to buy, and not before then.

Buying in anticipation often ends in unnecessary losses.

[Early buy points](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/747574-how-to-chart-an-early-buy-point.htm) can often present themselves in [flat bases](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/743141-bullish-stock-bases-have-many-positive-traits.htm), but the risk here is that the highs inside the base are still below the high of the left side of the base. That's the last resistance level that a stock must conquer for a legitimate breakout.

In the double-bottom pattern, a stock shows a good shakeout as the second leg down undercuts the first. It may even start rallying in heavy volume from there, but even if that happens, it doesn't mean that the stock is buyable.

"Overhead supply" is a big obstacle when a stock bottoms out and tries to form the right side of a base. When the stock rallies back, those who bought on the way down are often tempted to sell to break even on their investment.

That's why heavy-volume gains are good to see when a stock builds the right side of base. The buying demand must be strong enough to offset overhead supply issues and launch the breakout.

After a nice run-up, **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) consolidated gains in 2011. Seeing a base taking shape, eager buyers may have bought when the stock surged 7% in heavy volume during the week ending April 1 **(1)**. Weekly volume exploded to 3.5 million shares, well above its average at the time of 1.9 million shares. It wasn't a breakout, though. The stock stopped just short of a 60.83 buy point. So the buy was premature.

Acuity went on to rally less than 1% past the buy point before it started moving sideways again. Another flat base formed with a new buy point at 61.55. Current stockholders were hoping for another breakout attempt while others may have bought early during the second consolidation.

A breakout never materialized from the second pattern. Acuity tried in the week ended June 3 but reversed **(2)**. Acuity slumped as much as 46% from its high before bottoming in October.

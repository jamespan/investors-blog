The L in IBD's [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) seven-point investment system stands for "Leader." In other words, it highlights a critical factor for choosing and profiting from big stock market leaders. Always ask yourself: Is the stock a leader or a laggard?

At times, the difference between these two is as stark as day and night.

Other times, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two. Correctly pinning stocks as leaders — and not laggards — can mean the difference between a good year and a great year.

To Google something was first popularized in the early 2000s, well before Google — now **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — was even public. "Google" was even added as a verb to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006 — meaning to perform an internet search via the Google search engine.

The debut of Google in August 2004 and its breakout on Sept. 15-16 **(1)** past a 113.58 buy point (before splits) would lead to one of the first identifiable IPO bases. From there, the stock would appreciate 557% by November 2007.

And today the stock is still pursuing new high ground.

If the name of a company or one of its key products becomes part of the common vernacular, then it's definitely a company worth watching.

Some of the best [leading growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) have similar associations with their products and services.

## Stock Market Leaders: Netflix

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) popularized "binge-watching" in 2013 when the video streamer started to bulk-release episodes of its original content. Since then, shares have surged, rising over 50% in 2017 alone. And they may not be finished yet.

On Oct. 5, 2017, the stock surged above a 190.05 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) entry. On that day, Netflix announced subscription price increases.

An analyst at Wall Street firm Bernstein commented that the company's ability to raise prices while growing its membership indicates substantial pricing power.

After the close on Oct. 16 last year, Netflix announced [mixed Q3 results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-dips-early-despite-third-quarter-subscriber-beat/). Shares fell almost 2%, but they held above the correct buy point.

On the following Monday, Netflix roasted analysts' views on net subscriber growth in the fourth quarter as earnings leapt 173% to 41 cents a share on a 33% pickup in revenue to \$3.29 billion. Net margin improved dramatically, rising 290 basis points to 5.6%, the highest in three quarters.

Netflix shares now trade more than 93% above that 190.05 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It's forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).

## Stock Market Leaders: Amazon

As seen in IBD's stock research tables, the [Leisure sector](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-sep-13-2018/) has fallen off the top rungs. ranked No. 23 among 33 sectors through Thursday's close.

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has the "[Amazon effect](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/retail-stocks-are-crashing-not-amazon-wal-mart/)" — the ongoing disruption and radical transformation of the e-commerce industry. Amazon has its fingers in cloud services, video streaming, and even grocery stores, thanks to the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Next, the company could be heading into health care with the acquisition of a prescription-benefit management company.

The longtime [Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) has posted toasty gains and remains extended after rallying past its latest buy point at 1,213.51 in early January.

Earlier, Amazon had broken out with a lovely gap-up in price on Oct. 27, 2017, near 1,083. The stock spent much of its time forming a 13-week base underneath the 50-day moving average. But the overall decline from the base's 1,083.31 peak was a supermild 14%.

**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) laid the foundation for the current phrase "I'll Venmo you" — meaning "send money electronically." [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-adds-retail-purchases-to-venmo-app-ahead-of-apple-launch/) is a digital wallet that allows you to send money to friends or make purchases.

In October of last year, PayPal shares reached the [20%-25% profit-taking level](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) from a 55.24 [flat-base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) entry, allowing investors to lock in some gains before the earnings results. Yet those with strong conviction in the stock could have decided to hold as PayPal cooled off in November, forming a new base in the process.

Go to [historical weekly charts in MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com), and you'll notice how PayPal held firm during sell-offs to the 10-week moving average.

On Jan. 9 of this year, PayPal broke out again, this time moving past a 79.48 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). PayPal had cleared an earlier buy point in a much-longer [flat-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) at 44.62 in late April 2017.

## Not All Household Names Win

But making its way into your vocabulary doesn't always make it a sound investment. Does "send a snap" sound familiar? **Snap**'s ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) Snapchat app allows for the sharing of images, or snaps.

The [much-hyped IPO](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-tale-of-4-ipos-facebook-alibaba-snap-and-square/) debuted on March 2 to great fanfare, but the company doesn't make money yet. Shares never formed an IPO base and have cratered as much as 61% from their post-IPO high of 29.44.

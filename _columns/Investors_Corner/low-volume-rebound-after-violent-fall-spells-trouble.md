When you see your stock falling with heavy volume, you probably get a bad feeling about your stock. Then the stock starts to rebound and you feel so much better.

But if that rebound appears with low volume, you're still in trouble.

By now you know that volume is a crucial gauge of what the big-money funds are doing. That's why you want to see hot action when your stock breaks out, solid volume as it moves higher, and soft volume as it pulls back.

These are the signs of a stock under accumulation by the professionals. And, of course, you want them on your side.

So what sort of picture is painted by the high-volume decline followed by a low-volume rebound? You're looking at the biggest players unloading that stock.

You want to see any rebound appear with strong volume. So a low-volume climb is bad enough. Coming on the heels of a high-volume rout, you should know that the stock will find a wall of sellers not very far above.

**Green Mountain Coffee Roasters** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) enjoyed a monster run for nearly three years through September 2011. But its decline from its Sept. 20, 2011 **(1)**, peak picked up steam from Sept. 29 to Oct. 3, with volume surging in two of those three sessions **(2)**.

Now, the stock has sliced its 50-day moving average and is clearly on the defensive. If you still have some shares, you are plenty scared.

But wait â€” there's a high-volume upside reversal Oct. 4 **(3)**. Maybe you'll be OK after all. If only the stock could regain its 50-day line, you'd feel so much better.

Yes, if only. But the stock ratcheted higher four days in a row through Oct. 11 in low volume **(4)**.

This is the point where you should feel like a blind person groping in a knife shop. You can't see it, but you know you're walking into a sharp blade.

Green Mountain never made it as high as the 50-day line. Oct. 11 saw the stock end with a small gain, closing near the bottom of the day's range with below-average volume.

Green Mountain fell 4% in double-paced trade the very next day. Three days later, the stock was suffering the sort of high-volume rout that you want to avoid.

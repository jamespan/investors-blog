In the stock market, buying new issues can be the way to fast, astounding gains. But fresh-to-market stocks can also quickly hand investors big losses. Investors who want to partake in [initial public offerings, or IPOs](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm), must truly handle an IPO with care. They must follow proper sell rules religiously, because IPOs can be especially volatile.

  

New issues tend to come to the market with much fanfare. These companies usually have some kind of red-hot products or services, such as China's **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) with its diverse e-commerce platform, or **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) with its market-dominating wearable cameras. As a result, investors start itching to get a hold of shares.

  

Companies go public to raise money for expansion. So a company will sell a large stake of itself in exchange for funds, which allows investors a chance to own a piece of the action.

  

But unless they are well connected or have large accounts, most individual investors can forget about buying shares at the offering price. Investors will have to wait until they actually start trading.

  

This is when things can get dicey.

  

It's best not to buy into the hype in the first few days of trading, which can see huge swings in either direction.

  

So it's best to let the new issue settle down. After that, wait for the stock to build its first base.

  

Unlike other patterns, which are at least five or six weeks in length, bases of IPO stocks can be as short as a couple of weeks.

  

Look for tight, constructive action. Volume should be light during pullbacks and heavy during the stock's upside.

  

Networking-gear maker **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) went public on June 25, 1999, which was a Friday. Trading was wild the next week **(1)**, as the stock staged a huge bullish reversal.

  

Trading settled down a bit over the next three weeks, forming an IPO base with a 27.10 buy point.

  

Volume picked up in the weeks when the stock rose, which was a bullish clue.

  

Juniper broke out in the week that ended July 30. But with typical volatility of a new issue, the stock fell the next week as much as 10% below the 27.10 entry **(2)**.

  

That would have shaken out many shareholders. But they got a chance to get back in the week after that. The stock surged about 45% by late August before settling into another base **(3)**.

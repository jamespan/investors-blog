There was a time when electronic home organs, with their one-touch chord features, automatic bass lines and hokey built-in rhythm machines, sold like they were going out of style.

  

The sales pitch: Anyone can play right away. It's easy!

  

The truth was, the organs were going out of style.

  

Why? Partly because the sing-along family culture upon which they relied was receding. But also because owners found that learning to really play a musical instrument — not just fake a song or two — was a dadgum challenge.

  

Really learning to play the things required a commitment of time, mental energy and physical effort, and a willingness to suffer through many mistakes.

  

A \$3,500 console filled with colorful switches and sound effects didn't change that.

  

And that is the first vital lesson for people who want to know where to begin learning how to trade stocks.

  

It's not easy.

  

It demands time, commitment of energy and willingness to suffer through some mistakes.

  

The myth popularized among non-investors in the roaring 1920s was that you could get a hot stock tip from some market pro and make a fortune. It certainly happened. But more often than not, the opposite occurs, simply because pinpointing a potential winning stock is only one small piece of successfully working with and learning to profit from the stock market.

  

Grasping that fact is the [starting point](http://education.investors.com/).

  

If you are willing to invest the time and effort, start by setting up a trading account (easy to do) and reading "How to Make Money in Stocks" by IBD founder William O'Neil. Fund the account only with as much capital as you are willing to risk in your beginner's stage as an investor. And, when reading "How to Make Money," don't try to memorize the [book](https://www.investors.com/store/). Just do a quick read the first time through to familiarize yourself with the book's main messages and structure. You will return to it many times as a reference.

  

If you want to get some more mileage out of your effort, you may even want to set up linked accounts to learn alongside your spouse and/or kids.

  

The other big first step to becoming a successful investor is beginning to look at the world around you in terms of investment opportunities. Check out technologies that your kids use. Places where your spouse shops. Where the family likes to eat. How much you pay for everything you use. All of these things can cue economic changes and possible opportunities.

  

Over time, you're likely to find portions of the economy that you understand better than others, and learn the best ways to profit from them.

October's sharp sell-off [in the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) pummeled leading growth stocks. Many top stocks triggered [sell signals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) after strong breakouts above buy points. The weak action was enough to shift Wall Street into a stock market correction, according to [IBD's The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).








The stock market still remains in a correction, so new buys are not advised — even as the indexes have rallied significantly in recent days. Instead, investors should monitor the top stock ideas and wait for a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/).


What is a follow-through? In a nutshell, find a big one-day rise in a major index in higher volume vs. the prior session. The follow-through must occur a minimum four days into a new rally attempt after a severe slide in stocks. Not all follow-throughs work, so it's important to remain disciplined and patient even after the signal occurs.


Keep in mind that leading stocks of the past may not be the leaders of the future. To help pinpoint stock leaders that emerge in a new market uptrend, [use the relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to see which stocks are outperforming the general market.


The RS line helped identify **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) as potential leaders before their big gains over the past year.


Even In A Stock Market Correction, Watch The Relative Strength Line
-------------------------------------------------------------------


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), drawn in blue in all IBD [daily and weekly charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), is a key technical metric to help investors find leading stocks. It measures a stock's price performance relative to the S&P 500. The RS line trends upward when the stock is outperforming the market and vice versa.

CLOSE




During a stock market correction, investors should identify companies whose stock prices are fighting the stock market downtrend. A strong RS line will be pointing sharply higher, either during [the basing period](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) or soon after a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


The cybersecurity industry has been one of the top groups in 2018. Software stocks have gotten hit hard in October. Yet the security software industry group has held up strong. Through Tuesday's close, it ranked [No. 40 among 197 IBD industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-nov-06-2018/) for six-month price performance.


Leading stocks within the group — Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks — went on to solid advances after the stock market sell-off in early February.


The Big Move By Fortinet
------------------------



During the stock market's extreme volatility in February, Fortinet merely pulled back to its 50-day and 10-week moving averages before quickly rebounding. It marked the second such pullback to the support level after a breakout from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). Such bullish action also marked an [ideal follow-on entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


The RS line hit a new high Feb. 6 when the stock leapt 6% on strong earnings.


At its Oct. 1 peak price of 94.37, the stock gained as much a![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ICpanw102218.jpg)s 102% from the Feb. 6 closing price of 46.54.


Palo Alto's Breakout And The Rising RS Line
-------------------------------------------


Palo Alto Networks broke out above a 156.95 cup-shaped base entry on Jan. 18, but the RS line had not made a new high **(1)**. Shares failed to gain traction until they pulled back to their 50-day line. After finding support on Feb. 9, the stock went on an eight-day winning streak. The RS line hit new highs during that time **(2)**. Palo Alto shares continued to climb for months.


Palo Alto's stock looked to add to its gain when it broke out past a flat base on Aug. 24. But the move rapidly faltered. During the current market correction, the stock [triggered a defensive sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) when it fell more than 7% below the 219.48 entry, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) chart analysis.


A Spring 2018 Breakout For Square
---------------------------------


Another weak market environment from March to May created Square's [double bottom](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/) during that time frame.


Shares for the payments processing firm broke out May 8 above the 52.60 buy point. On that day, the stock's RS line didn't confirm the stock's strength. Several weeks later, the stock added a handle with a 57.29 buy point.


When the stock broke out on May 29, the RS line was much stronger. At its 101.15 peak, Square advanced 92% from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) with a 52.60 entry.


Square sold off below its 50-day moving average line on Oct. 10 in huge volume, triggering a [key defensive sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).

**Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) is one of the top [Chinese stocks to watch](https://www.investors.com/news/best-chinese-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/) in the current [stock market rally](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). But what were the signs that it could be a potential winner ahead of the stock's October breakout? For one, Pinduoduo stock's incredible power during the midst of an escalating trade war.




Chinese Stock Leader's Unique Take On E-Commerce
------------------------------------------------


Pinduoduo's e-commerce platform combines social networking with group shopping. The company's unique take on shopping helps buyers save money by enabling a team approach to discounted purchases. Key backers include Chinese internet giant **Tencent** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)).


According to CEO Zheng Huang, Pinduoduo is a combination of **Costco** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and Disneyland.

Pinduoduo's Power Up The Right Side
-----------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ICpdd111819-300x161.jpg)From July 12 **(1)** to Sept. 12 **(2)**, the stock advanced 93%. In comparison, the S&P 500 edged up a paltry 0.6% (from intraday low to intraday high) amid a worsening [U.S.-China trade war](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/trump-mulls-china-trade-war-retreat-dow-jones/). On an [IBD daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), you can look at the stock's skyrocketing [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to see a graphical representation of the stock's price performance relative to the general market during that time period.

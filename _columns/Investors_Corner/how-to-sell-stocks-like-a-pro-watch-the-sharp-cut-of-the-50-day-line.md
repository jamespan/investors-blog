Defense is a key part of investing. Things aren't always going to come up champagne and roses. You have to take action when a stock — even a longtime true market-winner — isn't moving in your favor.


On some days, what a stock does can test you. One such case is when a stock breaches its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) in a big way and does not rebound.


When this happens, don't be a deer in the headlights. Depending on the exact situation, investors may need to sell into weakness to cut losses. Doing so will protect any existing profits and avoid turning a winning trade into a losing one, a Wall Street sin.


The 50-day moving average is a key tool used by retail and professional investors. Many times, leading stocks will pull back and find support at or near the line.


Generally, institutions like to buy on weakness and will come in to support a stock that's pulling back to the 50-day line. Their buying causes the stock to rebound.


IBD calculates the 50-day moving average by adding up the price closes of a stock over the 50 most recent trading sessions, then dividing by 50. You get a specific number, such as 99.35. Then, when another trading day on Wall Street finishes, IBD goes through the same process all over again. A new 50-day average number emerges. Over time, you can take those numbers and form a line on the chart. That's why it is called a "moving average" and not a static one.


The 10-week moving average moves in similar fashion with the 50-day line, but it's only found on a weekly chart. The 10-week line reflects the trend of a stock's price over the past 10 weeks.


When a stock breaks the moving average and fails to recover, it could mean one of several things.


First, it could be just a shakeout.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IC_tzoo_071317-300x159.png)The stock can go slightly below the 50-day line and stay there for days or even a few weeks before staging a comeback. The stock can close a couple of percentage points below the line and not act as a sell signal. But if it ends 5% to 6% or more below, especially in heavy volume, one should sell. The big funds are unloading their positions in a big way.


Investors should also dump shares if the stock has already had a long, sharp advance and breaks the 50-day line in vastly higher trade. Another instance to sell is when the stock breaks the 50-day line after finding support there on previous occasions.


**Travelzoo** ([TZOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TZOO)), the online publisher of travel deals, had a huge rally after it broke out from a first-stage [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) on April 30, 2004. The stock tested its 50-day line in late June, July and August. Travelzoo pulled back to the line several times in October **(1)**, but kept climbing.


An early sell signal arrived when the stock staged a failed breakout from a flawed cup base **(2)**. What was wrong with its base? It did not meet the minimum time length of six weeks in price. It's easy to check this by looking at a [weekly stock chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), either at Investors.com or via [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012GE5).


Cup bases that are too narrow in length don't work because the stock, after staging a magnificent price run, hasn't taken enough time to squeeze out all the holders who are eager to sell their shares. It takes time for the stock to correct in price, bottom out, attract new long-term investors, get back near the old highs, and eventually break out to new price peaks.


On Jan. 7, 2005, the stock closed a hair below its 50-day. Two sessions later, Travelzoo breached the line in light yet accelerating trade. It also closed 11% below the line **(3)**. That was the sell signal; the stock fell another 39% in 23 days.


Since then, the stock has been one gigantic roller-coaster ride. On Thursday, shares traded at 10.90, more than 89% below a multiyear high of 103.80.

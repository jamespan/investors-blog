  If You Wait For Wall Street Analysts To Bail, It's Too Late: Learn The Key Sell Signals

It doesn't take a lot of time learning how to buy a stock using fundamental and technical analysis. But when you want to act upon the right sell signals, you need to consult stock charts.




Identify a firm showing good earnings and sales growth. Then learn how to tell when mutual funds and other institutional investors, the biggest drivers of a stock's price, are acquiring shares. [Bullish chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) form when the latter is happening. The patterns can lead to powerful upside breakouts, especially in the early stages of a new bull market.


After big gains for a stock, though, sell signals often arise. But don't count on the analyst community to tell you when it's happening. When it comes time to sell, they're often late. Sometimes, very late.


In June 2016, Deutsche Bank, BofA Merrill Lynch and Needham issued well-timed buys for former leader **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) just after its IPO. But through March  2017, they failed to publicly issue any sell ratings, even as Acacia has plunged off highs because of bursts in institutional selling by fund managers and other large investors.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ICacia032017-1024x552.png)Acacia quadrupled in price after a breakout from an IPO base with a 32.04 correct buy point. But signs of institutional selling started to crop up in the stock. In early September, shares slumped 6% in higher volume during the week ended Sept. 9 **(1)**. More signs of distribution followed after that.


An outright sell signal was triggered in the first half of October when Acacia fell below its 10-week moving average in huge volume **(2)**.


The 10-week line is a key support level to watch for a market leader.


The Best Time To Sell Under Armour
----------------------------------


Meanwhile, in late February 2017, Instinet downgraded shares of **Under Armour** ([UAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAA)) to reduce from neutral after the stock had already fallen more than 50% off its high.


But in early May 2016, [an IBD story](https://www.investors.com/news/under-armour-shares-sink-into-sell-territory-touch-50-day/) noted a sell signal in Under Armour when the stock fell 8% below a 45.53 [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). That triggered [the golden rule of cutting losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).



By early November 2017, UA shares went on to fall 75% below the 45.53 breakout price.


Cutting bait with a stock when it's not working prevents small losses from spiraling out of control. Sometimes, a stock will rally back after triggering the 7% to 8% sell rule, but it's a good rule to follow to preserve capital.


Learn These Chart Insights
--------------------------


Sell signals are annotated on daily and weekly charts in [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) for the IBD-exclusive features [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and the top-10 names in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) every day.


A break of support at the 50-day moving average (daily chart) or 10-week moving average (weekly chart) in heavy volume as well as cutting losses at 7% to 8% are annotated when appropriate.


IBD also has rules that showcase the time to sell on the way up. For instance, when a stock breaks out and rallies 20% to 25% past a buy point, investors will be reminded of an [IBD sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) that says to generally take at least partial profits when you have that level of success. That's around the time the stock is ready to consolidate gains and perhaps form a new base.



When To Give a Stock Star More Room
-----------------------------------


**Finisar** ([FNSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNSR)) delivered a powerful breakout in the summer of 2016 that yielded a solid gain.


The fiber optic telecom gear firm cleared a 19.30 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in late July. It [triggered the 20%-25% profit-taking rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) when the gain hit 20% during the week ended Sept. 9. But shares soared 17% in big volume, fueled by strong earnings.


Because of the signs of strength, those with conviction in the stock might've given it a little more room. Those who did were rewarded. The gain hit 31.42, up 62%, in early October just before Finisar settled into a new base.


The take-away here is that while [taking profits at 20%-25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) is generally sound strategy, there are some instances where it makes sense to give a potential market leader more room to run.

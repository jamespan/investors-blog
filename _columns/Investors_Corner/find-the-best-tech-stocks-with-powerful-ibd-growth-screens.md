The technology sector is home to plenty of fast-growing firms, and the home page of Investors.com is a great starting point to research the [best tech stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/).

The Stock Lists tab, found at the top of the home page, is where you access some of IBD's most popular growth stock screens.

## Where To Find The Best Tech Stocks

The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) is a list of leading growth stocks across a variety of sectors and industries, but tech stocks are always well represented. Tech stocks often show the best earnings and sales growth. And it's earnings growth that's the main fuel for a stock's advance. Click any column header to sort the IBD 50 as you wish.

[Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), one of IBD's most restrictive screens, is another good place to find the [best tech stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/). The list tends to expand and shrink based on general market health. In the early stages of a [stock market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), the screen tends to expand with leading stocks. But when [market conditions](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) start to deteriorate, usually because of increasing distribution days, the list tends to get smaller.

In a recent [Sector Leaders screen](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), eight of 10 stocks hailed from the technology sector.

## Top Tech Stocks Are Often New Issues

[IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) is also accessible from the [Stock Lists tab](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). Here, you'll find many tech stocks that have been trading less than three years with strong earnings growth and favorable [fund sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) trends.

Stocks tend to make their strongest moves in the early stages of being a public company, so it makes sense to focus on tech stocks in the IPO space.

**Incyte Pharmaceuticals** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) is back above its 50-day moving average as it works on a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) with the 88.93 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

**Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)), meanwhile, could be poised for a first test of its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). A bounce off the 10-week line with conviction would put the stock in a secondary buy zone.

And don't forget about the [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), which is also home to plenty of leading large cap stocks. Biotech **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), with a market capitalization of around \$30 billion, was a recent Big Cap 20 component. It's back near highs after a breakout over a 138.42 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) faded. A [new entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is 141.96, 10 cents above its April 10 intraday high.

## Tech Stocks On The Move

On the home page, the ["Stocks On The Move" stock list](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) is updated throughout the day and delivers a daily screen of heavy-volume gainers and decliners. It's where you'll often find tech stocks rising in heavy trade, a sign of very strong institutional buying. An initial appearance in the Up in Price section can spawn more as a mutual fund or other big investor builds a position in a stock.

There comes a point where every skydiver has to jump out of the aircraft.

The equivalent moment of total commitment for investors is when a stock hits the buy point.

In both cases, the key to survival is preparation. For paratroopers this means proper flight training, a perfectly packed chute and a thorough gear inspection.

Investors need to have carefully vetted their stock. Fundamentals must be up to snuff. Chart patterns must meet all necessary criteria. Know your price targets and sell rules.

Then, step out into that cold, thin air. Unlike the open door of an aircraft, buy points can be maddeningly elusive. They can shift and force investors to power down and wait — either for a new buy point or, in some cases, an entirely new chart pattern to form.

Or stocks can overtake buy points in weak trade, leaving prudent investors behind as they climb to new highs.

Still, buying at the correct buy point is crucial. It reduces risk and provides a cushion to keep you from being shaken out when the stock pulls back — as many do — to retest the buy point.

Buying in volume at least 40% above a stock's 50-day average is also crucial. It shows the stock's institutional investors are holding up their end of the bargain.

**Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) tested investors' patience during a long lull in the middle of a five-year advance. When the stock started basing in August 2005, it had already run up more than 350% in two years. There was no promise it would go any higher.

The stock bottomed and climbed 36% in November 2005 to February 2006. Then it shaped another cup base, built a low handle and broke out in big trade on April 27 **1**.

The low handle was a red flag. An even brighter red flag, on the day before the breakout, emerged as the stock dipped 1% in more than double its average trade **2**. Volume had been uneven across the breadth of the handle, with some upward wedging in the two weeks prior to the breakout. Not the kind of quiet, final shakeout you like to see.

The stock rose 13%, then nosed down into another cup pattern that featured a shallower drop than the second half of 2005. It built a handle with a 100.24 buy point starting Aug. 28, 2006. When it broke out on Sept. 20, volume was precisely 40% above its average **3**. The stock gained more than 600% in 22 months.

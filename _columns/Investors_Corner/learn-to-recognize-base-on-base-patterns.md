Stocks can often seem like they're doing their best to fool you or fake you out. Perhaps never is that more true than when a fundamentally healthy stock forms a base-on-base pattern. Base-on-base patterns take a large number of forms. Most commonly, a stock will climb out of a cup or a flat base, advance less than 20% — often much less — then stall and build another cup or flat base.

  

The result often sends investors looking elsewhere, forgetting about the stock until it roars past the base-on-base buy point and moves on to new highs.

  

**Take Two**

  

In "How to Make Money In Stocks," IBD founder William O'Neil says base-on-base patterns often form near the end of bear markets, when a top stock is fighting a negative trend in the overall market.

  

When the market turns and launches a [follow-through day](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764) , stocks in base-on-base patterns are often the first to emerge.

  

"It's like a spring that's being held down by the pressure of a heavy object," O'Neil wrote.

  

A textbook base-on-base pattern forms with the low point in the second base above or just even with the high point in the lower base. When bases do not match up this way, and instead are more equally aligned, they are base-beside-a-base patterns. These can produce positive breakouts, but they don't have the same spring-loaded effect as a base on top of a base.

  

**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) has stumbled through a series of not-quite base-on-base patterns for the past year. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has struggled to make headway, forming side-by-side flat base patterns since October.

  

Stocks that are currently making good on recent base-on-base breakouts include **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) (following an early January breakout) and homebuilder **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)).

  

Stocks with base-on-base patterns under construction include **Sykes Enterprises** ([SYKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYKE)), **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) and **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)).

  

Remember, the usual healthy base rules apply in terms of how deep, how long and where buy points occur. The one rule usually waived is the requirement for at least a 30% uptrend prior to the start of the base.

  

**An Exceptional Breakout**

  

A good example of a base-on-base vs. a troubled market is **Varian Medical Systems** ([VAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VAR)) in an early November 2000 breakout past a 50.10 entry point. The maker of radiation and X-ray therapy equipment didn't have fundamentals quite as strong as you'd like at the time. But its EPS was on the way to a 300% increase in 2000, then rose 29% in 2001.

  

The stock formed what was technically a base-beside-a-base pattern from April to October. The pattern was not perfect, partly because the base formed and the stock broke out as the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 were collapsing into the historical tech sell-off.

  

The Nov. 2 breakout occurred in volume that exploded 636% above average, and the rally began the month when the Nasdaq would drop more than 22%.

  

Varian shares rose 20% that November and went on to gain 270% over the next 40 months.

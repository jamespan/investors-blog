Volatility has returned to the stock market after low interest rates and central bank stimulus fueled more than five years of steady gains.

Trading stocks in a choppy market can be immensely challenging. But periodic corrections are normal. They also serve a useful purpose by setting the stage for the next big uptrend and ushering the entrance of great new stock winners.

The Dow sank 25% in six months after peaking at 213.36 on May 29, 1946 **(1)**, meeting the definition of a bear market. The blue chip index didn't regain its peak until April 10, 1950.

As might be expected, few stocks broke out of bases and embarked on big advances in the late 1940s. However, Conde Nast Publications, the owner of fashion and lifestyle magazines such as Vogue, continued to climb following its initial breakout in 1944, rising 514% from above a cup-based buy point of 10 in March 1944 to its peak of 77.50 in April 1946.

Conde Nast survived a paper shortage during the war and benefited from government purchases of magazines and books for troops fighting overseas.

The late 1940s' stock market slump featured a mild recession that lasted from November 1948 to October 1949, as many veterans returned in large numbers to find themselves unemployed. Also, a wave of strikes in 1946 crippled a wide range of industries, including mining and steel, hurting President Truman's efforts to rebuild the postwar economy.

Amid the turmoil, however, the groundwork was being laid for an economic boom that spurred a roaring bull market in the 1950s and '60s. In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which restricted the power of labor unions and quelled unrest. The Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which removed barriers to international trade, were both enacted in 1948.

Inventions during the era included the first computer, ENIAC, unveiled in 1946; the long-playing phonograph (LP); the transistor; the Polaroid camera; and Tupperware.

Gimbel Bros., which operated the Gimbels and Saks department stores, was among a number of retailers that enjoyed hefty advances in the immediate postwar period, before the market rolled over in the summer of 1946. Others included Bloomingdale Bros., furniture retailer City Stores and apparel retailer Edison Brothers Stores.

Lion Oil Refining was a rare winner that broke out of a base between early 1946 and the spring of 1949, IBD research shows. It cleared a double-bottom base at 49.25 in May 1947 and more than doubled in 11 months. By the late 1940s, a broader range of stocks cleared buy points and scored big profits. They included tire maker BF Goodrich and TV makers Admiral and Motorola. Detroit-based Pfeiffer Brewing tripled in 62 weeks after clearing a cup-with-handle base in April 1949.

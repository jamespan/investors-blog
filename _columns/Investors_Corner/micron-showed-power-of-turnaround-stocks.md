Investors could have easily overlooked chipmaker **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) in 2014.

  

Micron was a turnaround stock, rebounding from a series of losses extending back to 2011. The stock has risen sharply this year, easily outperforming the S&P 500.

  

Micron showed that turnaround stocks can become winners. Such stocks often fly under the radar because they tend to start out with weak IBD ratings. To see the potential of a turnaround stock, it takes a good knowledge of the company's industry and its competitive strengths.

  

Micron's turnaround has been driven by rising chip prices amid industry consolidation and its expansion into new markets.

  

Last year, Micron acquired bankrupt Japanese DRAM memory chipmaker Elpida. It's also moved into high-capacity flash memory, or Nand, chips, which are used in personal computers, smartphones, digital cameras and tablet computers.

  

The first sign that Micron had turned the corner came in June 2013, when it reported fiscal Q3 profit of 4 cents a share, rebounding from a loss of 24 cents in the year-earlier quarter. The better-than-expected result marked the company's first profit in eight quarters.

  

Not long after, on Aug. 13, Micron cleared a flat base with a 14.70 buy point, beginning a run that continued as profit and sales rebounded sharply.

  

The stock next cleared an 18.95 flat-base entry on Nov. 13, 2013. That was about a month after Micron reported better-than-expected fiscal Q4 results on rising chip demand and higher average selling prices.

  

By then, its ratings had improved markedly since its August breakout. Its Composite Rating had risen to 95 from 64, and its Earnings Per Share Rating was 79, up from 57.

  

Also, its Accumulation/Distribution Rating had risen to A- from a neutral C.

  

Micron shaped an eight-week consolidation starting last February. The consolidation was fifth stage, which was risky.

  

But some stocks fared well after clearing late-stage bases in 2014, and Micron continued to climb after clearing third- and fourth-stage bases in 2013.

  

The fact that it was in late-stage bases would have kept the stock off some investors' watch lists.

  

The consolidation showed a 25.78 buy point, which Micron cleared in heavy volume on April 22, a couple weeks after another better-than-expected quarterly earnings report amid continued strong demand for DRAM and Nand memory chips.

  

By then, Micron was a leader in the chip manufacturing industry group, which had risen to No. 4 out of 197 from about 80 in late 2013.

  

Micron rose to a high of 34.85 on July 18 **(1)**, when it started to shape a sixth-stage consolidation.

  

By then, the stock had risen 35% from its buy point, well above the 20% gain at which investors should take profits.

  

Those who hung on would have had to sit through a couple of sell signals as the stock broke through its 10-week line in heavy volume during the week ended Aug. 1 and again in the week ended Oct. 10.

  

Micron rebounded to clear a 34.95 entry Nov. 24 . The breakout from the late-stage base failed, however, and Micron is now testing support at its 10-week line.

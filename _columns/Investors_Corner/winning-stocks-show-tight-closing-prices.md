When you compress a spring, it gets far more powerful. Energy is stored in its coils. The same can be true of stock prices and the action in the best growth stocks.




Many winning stocks have periods of ultratight price closes, in which prices vary little or not at all for weeks at a time as the stock comes under institutional accumulation. Like that compressed spring, it sets up a possibility for a major advance in a stock with the right fundamentals.


That's the case with **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)), currently [No. 2 in the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10) and one of today's top-performing stocks.


Going back to late 2016 and early 2017, the leader in operations software for biotech and pharmaceutical firms formed multiple [bullish formations](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) including the [base on base](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/). The stock moved steadily higher after nearly two years of sideways action.

CLOSE




Veeva began forming one of those bases, a 15-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/), in December 2016. If you check the weekly [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) chart, you can see that the final weeks of price action on that cup showed exceptionally tight closes **(1)**. The "spring" was coiled.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wICveev062419-300x169.jpg)And then it sprung. In the week ended March 17, 2017, Veeva broke out on a big jump in volume, blasting right past the 48.05 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) with a 10% gain. Volume almost doubled vs. the stock's 10-week moving average to 9.3 million shares.


Veeva rose all the way to 68.07, up 41%, in just three months before starting to consolidate its gains. It formed a 38-week [consolidation pattern.](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) Then the stock broke out again on Feb. 28, 2018, blowing past a [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 68.17 in huge volume.


Winning Stocks: Bases And Tight Prices
--------------------------------------


In that long base, the MarketSmith chart pattern recognition tool identified a trio of [3 weeks tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) formations. Such tight price formations can be highly advantageous. Whether it's a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with tight price action, a rare [high tight flag](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/emulex-hoisted-a-high-tight-signal-flag-before-its-breakout/), an even rarer [square box base](https://www.investors.com/research/chart-reading-basics-why-the-flat-base-square-box-show-bullish-action/) (which is so close to a flat base, it's rarely used), or the [handle that finishes a cup](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) or a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), tight price closes signify a stock's power. Few institutional investors want to sell the stock hard.


In his [classic investment book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Money-Stocks-Winning/dp/0071614133), "How To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System For Good Times Or Bad," IBD founder William J. O'Neil explains: "There should be at least some tight areas in the price patterns of stocks under accumulation," he wrote. "If the base pattern has a wide spread between the week's high and low points every week, it's been constantly in the market's eye and frequently will not succeed when it breaks out."


Often, says O'Neil, "less-discriminating" investors watch such a stock run up 5% to 15%, and get sucked into buying it. Then the stock crashes and burns.



When it comes to stock prices, forget wide and loose formations. Tight is right.

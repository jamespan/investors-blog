The stock market is always in flux.

  

New products, new technologies, new desires and trends among consumers cause some sectors to advance while others retreat.

  

The ability to quickly recognize such change requires a constant state of informed vigilance.

  

That's why Investor's Business Daily divides the more than 6,000 stocks in its database into 197 industry groups. The listings and IBD's ranking system provide an indicator of which particular segments of stocks institutional investors are focusing on.

  

The stocks within IBD's industry groups are often changed and often come under review, being moved from one group to another as a company alters its products or its focus.

  

Beginning in 2009, analysts at William O'Neil & Co., a sister company of IBD, spent many months carefully reviewing all 197 groups. They rolled out major updates to the listings last May.

  

The result kept the total number of groups at 197. But it moved many stocks, updated the names of 35 groups, deleted 34 others and added 34 new designations.

  

The result provided a much clearer view of the current market breakdown.

  

One example: the Leisure-Travel Booking group. The eight stocks in this group grew out of the Leisure-Services group.

  

That original group contains resort chains, cruise ship lines and rental car providers.

  

The new segment is closely related, but clearly innovating a fresh angle on travel services.

  

Lifted initially by **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) and more recently by **Travelzoo** ([TZOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TZOO)), the group gained more than 130% in the past 12 months vs. a gain of about 20% for Leisure Services.

  

The division of coal and solar stocks, and fabless and nonfabless chipmakers also made it clearer to track each of these distinct industries.

  

Remember, as much as 50% of a leading stock's move owes to the strength of its industry group and broad sector.

  

You can track the movement of industry groups using IBD's 197 Industry Sub-Group Rankings Table, today on Page B2. The table shows each group's performance over various periods of time, such as three and six weeks ago.

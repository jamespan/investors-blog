What goes into a financially successful company? Cost controls, great new products, corporate strategies and financing decisions play major roles. But nothing much happens unless the business is producing sales, and in increasingly large sums.

To wit, sales growth is one of the first steps in learning how to analyze stocks. And superior sales growth marks a common characteristic of successful stocks. Research shows most winners boast at least a 25% year-over-year increase in quarterly sales before they start their major advances. Such robust top-line performance tells savvy investors the company is supporting strong earnings growth.

Put that 25% top-line gain into your checklist — the [C in CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) — for potential stock purchases. If a company's sales are less than 25%, watch for accelerating growth from one quarter to the next. The accelerating trend should occur over a period of at least three consecutive quarters.

## How To Analyze Stocks: Eye Acceleration

For example, you could see a streak in which revenue climbs 9%, 15% and 20% from year-ago levels. That's unusual strength that investors should not ignore.

Some companies will post accelerating sales at rates above 25%, which is even more desirable. For example, **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) posted sales increases of 28%, 31% and 33% in the quarters ended in October 2015, January 2016 and April 2016. The medical software leader was [shaping a base](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) during that time that ignited a rally of more than 50% from a 28.05 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) — and that was just to the next base.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ICtbl112519-202x300.jpg)If you spot a company with both accelerating sales and earnings, that's a potent combination.

In a sense, revenue numbers are more sincere than earnings. Cuts in research and development, plant expansions or labor reductions can inflate profits, at least temporarily.

But not everything in the revenue line is wholesome.

Companies can fudge sales in the way they recognize revenue. Sales may be booked at different times to make the quarter's numbers look good. A major acquisition can skew sales numbers, too.

A study commissioned by **BlackLine** ([BL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BL)) found that 82% of global investors believe companies in their portfolios "often resort to legal but 'creative' accounting tactics."

  How To Trade: Top Big Cap Stocks Can't Gain Traction

The market's attempt at righting itself is pushing higher a number of top-rated big-cap stocks. But some show trouble maintaining their new and improved action.


Credit card leaders **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) each scored new 52-week highs on Friday. But those gains aren't sticking. Each has reversed lower the past two days and closed at or near the session's worst prices.


Maybe it's something to do with the credit card business? No. Tobacco giant **Philip Morris** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)) hit its all-time high Thursday and reversed lower.


It tried to regroup Friday but reversed lower. Monday, Philip Morris took out Thursday's record high by 3 cents â€” then faded badly. The stock now shows three straight poor closes.


What else do these three stocks have in common? Their suspect three-day performances lured low volume. That's not the best way for a stock to explore new highs.


But then, the market is still in a correction. Maybe it's to their credit they've done so well without a broad uptrend.


Gas pipeline operator **Enbridge** ([ENB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENB)) had been trying to claw back to its Nov. 18 peak (which also ended with a downside reversal).


Enbridge notched its fourth-straight advance Thursday, but ended that day much nearer the session's low than its high. Friday saw the stock rise a bit and reverse lower. Monday, the same.


Enbridge could not muster any special volume the past three days. That's just as well for the stock, as the poor closings during that stretch would look far uglier with heightened turnover.


Oil & gas producer **Anadarko Petroleum** ([APC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APC)) closed weakly Thursday. Friday saw gains fizzle with a downside reversal. That day, Anadarko rose as much as 3%, then ceded virtually the entire advance.


Monday's action wasn't so bad. Anadarko climbed 2% and closed in the middle of the day's range. Still, volume was weak.


Perhaps the biggest standout amid this spate of weakness is search-engine king **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)). The stock broke out Oct. 24 from its 599.70 buy point from a cup-with-handle base.


The stock's potential looked in doubt, thanks to a lack of proper volume surge on or after the breakout. The stock fell 5% from its buy point, then got back to break-even and added 3%.


A seven-day losing streak Nov. 16 to Nov. 25 cost Google 9%. Now, though, Google has advanced for four days in a row, and stands 4% above its buy point.


Google ended Monday near the lower end of the day's range, like many stocks. But Thursday and Friday, as others struggled, Google outperformed.


Also impressively, Google's volume climbed on the stock's best days.

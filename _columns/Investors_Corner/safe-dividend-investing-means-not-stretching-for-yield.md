  Stretching For A High Yield Is Inviting Trouble

When economic times are good, conservative investors sometimes stretch for yield.


In good times, it's hard to imagine anything going wrong, so why not pick up a bigger dividend?


The problem is that stretching can change a portfolio from low risk to high risk in a hurry. It's like a modified 1911 Little Willie verse:


*Willie's yields were dynamite,*



*Didn't understand it, quite.*



*They heard the blast in the Serengeti,*



*Willie's portfolio is now confetti.*


In bad times, risks sometimes come into play. Earnings shrink, making payouts questionable. If earnings shrink enough, then dividend increases end. If earnings worsen further, the dividend is cut. And if things really head south, the dividend is eliminated.


Of course, an investor can always sell before trouble emerges. However, that's easier said than done. By the time a sell rule applies, much of the paper gains will have vanished. Timing a bad investment is more difficult than timing a good investment.


A good investment doesn't require perfect execution in order to make money. A longer climb gives the investor more opportunities to leave with a gain.


Stocks with only a high yield going for them aren't necessarily guaranteed to rise, which means that investors will have to play them that much better. So dividend investors will sleep more soundly if they don't focus too much on yield.


What, then, should they focus on?


A stock's liquidity, dividend growth rate and dividend stability are worth considering. Such an approach isn't absolutely safe (what is?), but it decreases the odds of getting burned badly.


The screen above, run on Sept. 1, shows liquid stocks with good dividend growth rates and dividend stability ratings. IBD's daily Income Investor column has recently covered some of them.


Another way to keep a conservative bent on a portfolio is to buy stocks in the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrat list. These are stocks that have increased their dividend payouts for 25 consecutive years.


The Aristocrats list is well-balanced. Its 52 constituents represent ten sectors. (Sometimes chasers of high yields end up invested in only a few sectors, which increases risk. Normal sector rotation can create havoc for such investors.)


As of Aug. 31, sector exposure in the Dividend Aristocrats broke down like this: consumer staples, 25% (results are rounded); industrials, 15%; health care, 13%; financials, 13%; materials, 12%; consumer discretionary, 12%; energy, 4%; utilities, 2%; telecom, 2%; and information technology, 2%.


The Aristocrats list includes stocks such as food distributor **Sysco** ([SYY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYY)), utility **Consolidated Edison** ([ED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ED)), home improvement store **Lowe's** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)), steel producer **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and cleaning products firm **Clorox** ([CLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLX)).

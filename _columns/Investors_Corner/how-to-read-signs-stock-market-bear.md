You may have seen those stock market headlines on the internet that say something like this: "Why Dead Mice Inc. Plunged Yesterday."









 
 
 Don't you think if the media really knew the answer, they would've told us the day before yesterday?
Predicting the market is a fool's errand. Yet the investor who carefully studies the market can get a sense of the market's condition, and that knowledge is worth something, particularly when it's compared to ignorance. This is the great edge that IBD readers attain by making [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) a daily ritual.


Consider the last two big corrections the Nasdaq has suffered. Both came in 2015 and both involved roughly 18% corrections.


Clues On The Chart
------------------


The first began July 21, 2015, just after the Nasdaq made what turned out to be a peak. The Nasdaq then lost 18% in just under five weeks — even worse on the exchange-traded Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Fund ([ONEQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONEQ)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ICnsdq031918-468x1024.png)What were the chart clues as the stock began to fall?


The Nasdaq gapped down July 22 **(1)** and volume jumped 15% vs. the prior day, [a clear distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). The index staged bearish negative reversals in the next two sessions. Then the index gapped down again, losing its 50-day line **(2)**. All four days came in above-average volume.


Other indicators looked like trouble. On July 20, new lows bearishly outnumbered new highs. New lows held their advantage in the sessions ahead.


From July 22 through Aug. 6, the indexes suffered [cluster distribution](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) — multiple losses in rising volume that point to institutional selling.


Now let's look at the 18% correction that began Dec. 2, 2015, and which lasted about 10 weeks.


The Nasdaq staged negative reversals Dec. 2 and 3 **(3)** and gapped down Dec. 11, slicing under its 50-day line **(4)**. Volume was above average in each session.


Cluster distribution was the story here, too. One or both of the major indexes suffered distribution in five of the six sessions from Dec. 2 to Dec. 9.


New lows began outnumbering new highs Dec. 2 and kept their advantage for almost three weeks.

The cumulative message was convincing in both cases. Negative reversals, cluster distribution and new lows were signaling trouble. But whether the signal was for a minor dip, a 10% correction or a nearly 20% pullback was impossible to determine.


If an investor was holding an exchange traded fund based on either the Nasdaq composite (symbol ONEQ) or the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ), a savvy chart reader could've been at least partly in cash before major damage occurred.


IBD-style investors playing individual stocks also could've used the clues to lighten up.

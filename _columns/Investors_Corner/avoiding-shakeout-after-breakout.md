Cutting your losses short is one big key to [successful investing](http://news.investors.com/investing.aspx), but it's not that easy to figure out whether you're selling prudently or just getting shaken out.


IBD tries to help in this regard with some guidelines on pullbacks after a breakout.


One guideline is the 7%-8% sell rule. When a stock breaks out in proper fashion from a consolidation, you should buy as close as possible to the ideal buy point, but then — according to this rule — sell if the stock ends up falling 7% or 8% below your purchase price.


IBD's research has found that most big winners won't drop back below their buy points after a breakout. Most is not all, however. About 40% will undercut their buy points, according to this research. Still, they generally won't trip the 7% or 8% sell rule, so you should sell if your stock does so.


Another useful guideline for pullbacks after a breakout has to do with the 50-day moving average (or on a weekly chart, the 10-week moving average). This guideline says that a first or second pullback to the 50-day or 10-week line is fine, but once you see the third or fourth pullback, it's smart to turn a bit more cautious about that stock.


Keep in mind that retreats from a breakout don't have to follow any particular schedule. You might see them happen the very next day, or it might be several weeks or a couple of months later.


Check out **CommVault Systems**' ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) action last year, if you want to learn about pullbacks after a breakout.


In September, the stock broke out beyond a buy point at 53.90 from a cup-with-handle base. Within a few sessions, it showed a gain of 10%, but then it moved sideways for about a month. **(1)**


Then, just ahead of a quarterly earnings report, the software maker undercut its 53.90 buy point.**(2)** However, the stock dropped only 2% below that level, so you wouldn't have sold based on the 7% or 8% sell rule.


The drop in late October also represented CommVault's first test of support near its 10-week line, rather than a later-stage test. So that also shouldn't have caused alarm.


Investors who held on during this first pullback were rewarded, as CommVault soared on big earnings and built on that gain.

Few things feel as homey and comfortable to chart readers of the [CAN SLIM ilk](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) as cup-with-handle bases.

Cup-with-handle bases are common and easy to identify, and often preface powerful rallies. Most cup bases possess a number of basic traits, discussed in Tuesday's column.  They can be as short as seven weeks long. But they are generally longer -- occasionally reaching lengths of a year or more.

This time frame can make even a common, familiar base type tricky to spot. The tendency among growth investors is to set aside leading stocks that slump into long-term consolidations. Many of them take years to recover. Others never do.

One recent example of a long-term cup was **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), which cleared an eight-month cup with handle on Thursday. **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), on the other hand, has been struggling to clear a buy point in a similar, six-month base.

A model case was **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), which crafted a cup-with-handle base throughout most of 2010, when it was called Biogen Idec.

The base began late in March. Seven of 12 weeks on its down leg were weekly declines in above-average volume. Yet this action showed institutional investors selling in a controlled rather than panicked fashion. Six of seven weeks on the upside were advances, and four of them occurred in above-average trade. During the last two, trade rose 46% and 57%, respectively, above Biogen’s weekly average.

Both of those weeks closed below the midpoint of their weekly ranges. This activity raises a warning flag. But unless other flaws appear, it is not a deal killer for a base. The depth of the base was 24%, well within the 35% maximum limit from intraday high to low for normal cups.

The right side of the cup topped out in the weeks that ended July 30 and Aug. 13, 2010. In both weeks, the stock notched a high of 58.16. The handle slipped 9% lower in quiet trade, retesting its converging 10- and 40-week moving averages.

A burst of heavy trade shook out the final sellers and left the stock perched atop its 10-week moving average in the week that ended Sept. 24. Biogen traded quietly for a few more weeks. On the day of its breakout past a 58.26 buy point, Biogen held a 92 Composite Rating from IBD. Its EPS Rating was a powerful 96, and its RS rating -- despite nearly seven months of basing -- was an imperfect but still healthy 81. Its Sales, Margins and Return on Equity grade was an A, Accumulation/Distribution a B+.

The outcome: a 725% rally over the next 53 months.

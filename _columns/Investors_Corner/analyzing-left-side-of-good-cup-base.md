**How To Spot A Fine Chart:** [First In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/609681/201204301622/how-to-spot-a-fine-chart.aspx)

Not all cups are alike. Sometimes the differences jump out at you. But it's the subtle details that can trip you up.

In this, the first in a new Corner series on how to assess the quality of a stock base pattern, we'll examine the left side of a cup — what it should and shouldn't look like.

Simply put, a cup's left side is no place for panic.

The left side of a cup appears when a stock falls. What do you want to see? Big volume, a steep retreat with the unmistakable stink of panic all over it?

Certainly not. You're looking for a calm decline, without serious volume surges. The stock shouldn't just collapse like an old building. Rather, the decline should be smooth and orderly.

Why do you care how a stock falls if you don't yet own it? The answer: You're still shopping, and you're tracking the professional big-money fund managers. That's what brought you to this stock in the first place. Dramatic, high-volume sell-offs are the footprints of those managers dumping as much as they can, as fast as they can.

If you have been base-hunting for some time, you'll have noticed that some volume increases on a cup's left side are hard to avoid. But don't accept huge, scary surges.

Now let's say your cup's left side shows no such panic. Look at the stock's weekly chart. You're looking for weekly closes in the upper 60% of the weekly range.

This shows funds are likely adding to their positions — even on the way down. You want to see the big guys getting in, not out.

**Hologic** ([HOLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLX)) built a 19-week consolidation starting in the week ended July 2, 2004. The left side appears with four straight weekly losses **1**. Volume's biggest surge appears in Week 1 **2**, as trade climbed 22% above its usual pace.

That's not much. The medical gear maker ended that week with a loss of just a few pennies — and in the upper 60% of its trading range.

Week 5 shows Hologic's first weekly gain since the cup began **3**. In fact, the stock had sliced below its 10-week moving average and then regained it, posting an upside reversal. This shows the hands of big funds accumulating shares. It's no coincidence that the stock bottomed just a week or two later.

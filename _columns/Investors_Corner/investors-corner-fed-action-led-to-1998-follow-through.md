When conditions are their bleakest, sometimes that's the best time to buy stocks.

When everyone throws up their hands and thinks it's the end of the world, astute investors usually begin thinking about going the opposite way. Even so, you should wait for a follow-through signal.

In the late 1990s it looked like the world was falling apart. Russia defaulted on its government bonds. The turmoil caused a flight to quality. Investors rushed to the safety of U.S. Treasuries, pushing up prices. But this spelled trouble for a behemoth hedge fund, which bet on lower bond prices.

Worse yet, Long Term Capital Management used monster amounts of margin in its bets. Even with Wall St. veteran John Meriwether and options gurus Myron Scholes and Robert Merton on board, heavy leverage and a wrong bet led to disastrous results.

Long Term Capital Management lost billions. It had to be bailed out in a move orchestrated by the Federal Reserve of New York in late September 1998.

The Nasdaq, which had been in a sharp uptrend for months, reversed from a record high in the week ended July 24, 1998 and tumbled 33% by early October.

On Sept. 8, 1998, the Nasdaq bolted 6% in heavier volume â€” the fifth day of a rally attempt. But the move petered out after hitting resistance near the intersection of its 200-day and 50-day moving averages about three weeks later. Not all follow-throughs work.

The Nasdaq went on to make a new low Oct. 7. Then on Oct. 15, the tech-heavy index staged a Day 5 follow-through, surging 4.6% in higher volume. That day, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points. The Fed had made a similar cut just a month earlier.

The LED expert cleared a handle a few days earlier, but volume was below average **2**. Also, the market was still in a downtrend so buying was still risky. Cree broke out Oct. 16 and tripled from a 17.60 buy point before making its first pullback to the 50-day line **3**.

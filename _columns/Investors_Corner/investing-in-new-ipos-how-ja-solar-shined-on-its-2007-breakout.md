Few abbreviations in the investment trade are as intoxicating as IPO — initial public offering. The challenge is this: When is the right time to buy a new issue? After all, it can be highly tempting to jump quickly into a new stock.
As with any stock, you must wait for a proper base to form in order to spot a buy point that offers potential for big gains and lower risk. Focus on those with excellent growth in earnings and sales as well as solid industry group strength.


In some cases, a stock with outstanding credentials will take off after trading for only a few weeks. But in most cases, patience is key.


Fledgling stocks have no trading history. This limits an investor's ability to gauge whether shares are fairly priced.


In some cases, shares seem to be drastically underpriced — especially during a weak market — so that they will shoot higher at the start of trading. Consider SouFun Holdings, a Chinese real estate marketer that went public Sept. 17, 2010, at 42.50 a share. It opened its first day of trade in the 60s and closed at 73.50. SouFun, now known as **Fang Holdings** ([SFUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFUN)), had a rough ride over the next few years.


IPOs came back in fashion in 2010 after a slump, with nearly 120 new stocks hitting U.S. markets through November that year. Also at that time, a surprising 60% of those had traded above their IPO prices. **Jinko Solar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) and **China New Borun** ([BORN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BORN)) are two that have turned in explosive advances. Use the IPO AfterMarket feature, found at the top of the New America page in IBD Weekly, to track significant moves by new issues.


 IPOs can also tell a riveting story. Recent offerings have revealed new or developing areas in technology, energy, fashion, travel and dining.

**JA Solar** ([JASO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JASO)) rose 41% in the three weeks after its IPO in February 2007. But the stock at that point held subpar ratings for its earnings performance and other factors.


Investors were better off waiting. This meant risking being locked out of a fast advance right at the start. But a great IPO will eventually offer a solid entry point. This reduces risk, and it's smart to wait until fundamentals improve.


JA Solar wasted no time in laying out a welcome mat. The solar cell maker dipped into its first consolidation the week ended March 2 **(1)**. Shares unwound 23% as they shaped a six-week-long cup.


During that base, the company reported first-quarter earnings of 6 cents a share, sharply above year-earlier levels. Revenue took a 10-fold leap to more than \$43 million.


The news, on April 12, sent the stock charging through the base's 21.20 buy point in very heavy trade **(2)**. The Big Picture's Market Pulse table at the time noted that stocks were in a "confirmed rally," but cautious investors may have wanted to see better fundamentals.


The next day, April 13, IBD upgraded JA Solar's EPS Rating to a 75 and its Composite Rating to an 80, alongside solid Relative Price Strength and industry group strength ratings. The stock opened the day less than 3% above the base's buy point — a good time to jump in. Shares rocketed higher and held a 36% gain through April 25.


JA Solar then turned down, forming a narrow, seven-week double-bottom base **(3)**. As the base formed, the fundamentals strengthened even further. Shares passed the base's 28.19 buy point in soft trade on June 15 **(4)**. Volume kicked in several days later, and shares rose 56% over the next four weeks. JA Solar formed another base and broke out in September to big gains again.

Markets abhor uncertainty. And perhaps nothing breeds more uncertainty than a war that starts with a surprise attack like the Korean War in the early 1950s.


To the investor, wars create volatility and opportunity.


You do not have to be able to predict such events. But you do need to be flexible and know when to quickly raise cash to avoid huge losses in stocks. Then you must be able to buy with conviction when the market, via the follow-through bottoming signal, has given investors a green light to buy leading new stocks.


IBD teaches such techniques via this column and the [Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). Market timing is essential to making great trades.


On Sunday, June 25, 1950, the North Korean People's Army surprised South Korea and a small contingent of U.S. military personnel, pouring south across the 38th parallel. The next day, North Korean tanks were at the outskirts of the South Korean capital of Seoul.


The day after that, President Harry Truman secured a United Nations resolution calling for military assistance to the South. Truman named Gen. Douglas MacArthur to head two U.S. divisions in what he called a "police action." For the next three years, the U.S. would fight a difficult and costly war to an eventual standstill that lasts to this day.


Kim Jong Un, the grandson of Kim Il Sung, the supreme leader who launched North Korean forces against the South, is in charge today, still raising havoc in the region.


The Monday morning after the attack in 1950, the Dow fell 4.7%. The next day, the market lost 0.8%, with volume reaching the heaviest since September 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. From a June 12 intraday high to a July 13 low, the Dow lost 14.8%. Yet the correction was contained; the Dow had just about recovered its loss by September, when U.S. forces launched the Inchon invasion and the liberation of Seoul.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ICch_050816.jpg)The Korean War had important consequences for the economy. Rather than build deficits, Truman preferred a pay-as-you-go strategy. Supported by Congress, he raised income, corporate and excise taxes to record levels in 1950 and 1951.


At the war's outbreak, inflation skyrocketed as consumers hurried to buy, fearing shortages. Prices rose 11% from the war's onset until price controls were imposed Jan. 26, 1951. In its last year, war expenses made up 14.1% of GDP.


Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected in November 1952 on a platform of ending the war. An armistice went into effect on July 27, 1953.


The market's advance once the war was underway was mild and choppy. Still, some winners emerged. One winner was United Aircraft, later to become current Dow Jones industrial average memberÂ **United Technologies** ([UTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTX)), which owned the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Engine Co. Pratt & Whitney built jet engines used in fighters and bombers. United broke out of a cup-with-handle base in 1949. By 1953, 87% of sales were to the government. It gained 256% in 169 weeks.


Better bets surfaced at the end of the war when price controls and materials restrictions were lifted. Enter Outboard Marine, a maker of outboard motors. It expanded its offerings to include snowblowers, lawn mowers and chain saws, and its earnings and stock price exploded.


Following a strong breakout in January 1954, Outboard gained 720% in 177 weeks, ascended into a climax run on a 3-for-1 stock split and gave a clear sell signal. See the entire chart in the fourth edition of "How to Make Money in Stocks" by IBD chairman and founder Bill O'Neil.

For nonprofessional investors, time is scarce.


You might think that's a great disadvantage in the investment game.


Actually, the shortage of time can help the individual investor to focus properly. If you only have 15 minutes a day to devote to the stock market, you can't afford to waste time.


Think of it as "15 minutes tight." This means that just as a stock stays in a tight range when forming a bullish pattern, you don't stray and diddle-daddle when using your 15 minutes.


You might be surprised how much you can learn from 15 minutes of pure concentration five times a week.


Here's how an investor might use IBD as a 15-minute toolbox.


**One minute** (14 minutes left on the clock): Scan those nine little boxes at the top of the front page. You might circle the most bullish item with a green pen and the most bearish item with a red pen.


**Two minutes** (12 minutes left): Read the headlines in To The Point on A2. You're not looking for anything in particular. Stop and circle an item only if it's relevant to the market. Check the Coming Up item that tells what economic reports will be released in the next session.


**Two minutes** (10 minutes left): Turn the pages, looking for stories on stocks that might be watch-list worthy. Don't read the stories now. Circle the story if it's worth a look on lunch hour or a restroom break.


**One minute** (nine minutes left): Stop and scan the Growth Funds Leading The Market on the Mutual Funds & ETFs page. You want to see what they are buying and selling, but don't scan unless the fund is highly rated.


**One minute** (eight minutes left): Look at the graphic of Small Cap Growth Funds Vs. Big-Cap Growth Funds in the Mutual Funds & ETFs section. On the Futures page, check the charts on copper (an economic indicator) and oil (a key commodity).


**One minute** (seven minutes left): In the B section, look at the stocks in boldface in Stocks On The Move. These stocks have good ratings and are making gains in strong volume.


**One minute** (six minutes left): Check the new highs vs. new lows, and which sectors have the most new highs. In a healthy market, new highs dominate. Read or scan the new high column.


**Three minutes** (three minutes left): Study the charts of the indexes on the "What's The Market Trend?" page. Read or scan The Big Picture column, or at least the Market Pulse.


**One minute** (two minutes left): Look at the Stock Spotlight charts. Try to ignore the name and focus on the chart. If it's interesting, circle the name for later research. Look at the other lists on the page.


**One minute** (one minute left): Scan the sector rankings, and check the column headlines to see if there is anything you wish to follow-up on later.


**One minute** (and then time's up): Look at the Psychological Market Indicators.


A drill like this isn't comprehensive, and reasonable people will disagree on what might be added or subtracted. But you should put together a 15-minute drill. If done consistently, it will give you a strong sense of where the market is. If you already devote more than 15 minutes a day, the quick drill makes a good starting point.

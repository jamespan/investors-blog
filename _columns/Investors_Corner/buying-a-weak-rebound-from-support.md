Few things comfort a [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/) investor like a well-vetted, leading stock in an uptrend that continues to find support at its 10-week moving average.

A touchback to 10-week support produces a buy opportunity, especially the first two rebounds after a breakout from a base. This gives investors a chance to expand a winning position with measured risk and to concentrate their capital in their best-behaving stocks â€” a key principle of IBD-style investing.

But what if a stock comes off its 10-week or 50-day moving average in weak trade? Is that still a follow-on buy opportunity?

At times, big volume doesn't kick in until some time after the initial rebound. Buying during a rebound in weak trade, in a bid to get in and wait for volume to kick in, is a valid strategy. But here are some factors to keep in mind:

First, watch the stock closely after the buy. Note how it finishes the week. An increase in volume or a finish high in the week's range is a good sign.

Second, have a close look at the market. Were there factors (like a pending Federal Reserve announcement or key piece of economic data) that restrained overall market trade? Did this restraint affect your stock? If market action is quite positive, it might lend a weak rebound a bit more credibility.

Check performance of the stock's overall sector or group. If these are showing unusual strength, they might shore up a weak-volume bounce.

Also, price is going to factor more strongly into this type of situation. Higher-priced stocks are likelier to remain stable during a rebound in soft trade, and they are less likely to see violent stabs of trade that could drag them back below 10-week support.

It is also a situation in which investors should be clear about their own risk tolerances. Because it is an add-on buy point, smaller amounts of cash will be involved than at initial breakouts.

The 7% to 8% stop-loss sell rule applies. And investors buying rebounds in weak trade may want to tighten up their sell levels significantly.

A good example of such a light-volume rebound was **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) in October.

It had cleared a flat base in July and a tight consolidation in September, then pulled back to just kiss support at its 50-day line on Oct. 9 (please see daily chart). On a weekly chart, Actavis briefly undercut the 10-week line **1**.

It etched small gains in weak trade in five of the next seven sessions. It then flattened out, but never returned to retest support. Buying during any one of the five sessions would have been a good move.

Volume did not kick in until 14 sessions after the touchback to 10-week support. Shares rose 6% in twice their average trade on Oct. 29. The stock diligently gained, climbing 68% through Feb. 26, then entered its current consolidation.

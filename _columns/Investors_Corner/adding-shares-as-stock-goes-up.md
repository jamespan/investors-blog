A stock investment doesn't end the moment you buy shares.

A purchase is just the start of a process that requires investors to make adjustments to control risk and enhance rewards.

Here's how the process works:

The starting point is the initial purchase. If you plan on investing \$10,000 in a stock that breaks out of a sound base at 50, consider starting with half of the total investment as your foundation. In other words, buy 100 shares.

Spend the other \$5,000 making a couple of additional purchases as the stock moves up. The second purchase could be worth \$3,000 in additional shares, and the final purchase worth the remaining \$2,000. When do you make those follow-up buys?

Look for secondary entries in the stock's chart. A primary one is when shares pull back to the 50-day or 10-week moving average and rebound in robust fashion. (Another way is to add shares as the stock rises a few percentage points from the buy point, a concept that was discussed in Monday's [column](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/694194-pyramiding-involves-making-a-series-of-buys.htm).)

Another important part of managing a new purchase is to sell part of your shares if the stock is not working out. For example, you might need to sell a portion of your shares if the stock starts trading below its 50-day line. Sell the higher-priced shares first.

If the stock falls 7% or 8% below the primary buy point, you must sell all shares to cut losses short.

In the week ended Oct. 14, 2011, **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) broke out of a choppy cup with loose handle at 42.10, 10 cents above the handle's high of 42. Volume was light, yet the coffee-chain giant was a tempting choice, having recorded impressive earnings growth and accelerating sales growth in the most recent quarters.

At the breakout, investors had their chance to make a first purchase. After climbing 6% from the buy point to 44.69, Starbucks eased to its 10-week moving average **1**. Volume was thin **2**, a good sign. But the new buy point near 41.35 was lower than the original buy point, so this was not a proper time to buy. It's key to average up in price, not down.

A couple of weeks later, a light pullback to the 10-week line near 43 3 provided a proper follow-on entry. The stock dipped no more than 3.7% below the original 42.10 entry, so there was never a sell rule.

Starbucks gained 47% by April 2012. In May, it made a decisive break below the 10-week line. That triggered a sell signal and capped the investing cycle.

In the first 20 trading days after the presidential election, businessman and President-elect Donald Trump could already lay claim to a title.


The Trump stock market got off to its best start since Reagan in 1980 and Clinton in 1992. The No. 1 rank, among those three, depends on which index is used. As first impressions go, Trump was the king of the small-cap Russell 2000, up 14% in his first 20 days. Clinton was the champ of the Nasdaq, up 8% in the first four weeks after his election. Reagan was the general on the large-cap S&P 500, up 6% in the first four weeks.


Obama and the two Bushes got negative receptions in their first 20 trading days.


Can Trump bring back the Reagan-like exuberance? A first impression can fade to an unremarkable performance in a month or two. Yet Reagan and Trump might share one big thing in common: Reagan's presidency coincided with the start of a supercycle in August 1982. As noted in the [front-page article](https://www.investors.com/news/trump-win-stocks-rise-new-bull-market/) of IBD Weekly during the week of Nov. 14, some market watchers say the same thing could happen to Trump.


The challenge is spotting a new reality quickly enough to profit from it. How is that best done?


For stock pickers, broadly based indexes aren't a particularly good way to find anything specifically useful in the presidential stock-market story. A better gauge is to look at which industry groups thrived and which sagged during a presidency. This tells individual investors where money is flowing.


And it could point the way to stock-market winners, as the Trump presidency unfolds over the next few years.


IBD studied the past five presidents and how they did in each industry group. The results included some surprises, along with a sense of how much or how little presidents matter to the stock market.


Five factors emerged in relation to how the stock market reacts to a president:


**Confidence:** President Reagan, probably the most optimistic of the five presidents, communicated confidence. Retail is the sector that benefits most directly from consumer confidence, and Reagan is the only president with two of his top four industry groups from the retail sector. Retail-Super/Mini rose 738% and Retail-Department Stories 640% from October 1980 to October 1988. (Results were scanned with Oct. 31 as the cutoff date in order to include reactions to a candidate's win and to eliminate at least part of the lame-duck window.)


**Innovation:** A president has no role to play in engineering new products. But when inventions lead to breakthrough products and the companies become rewarding investments in the stock market, a president can help by getting out of the way and keeping others out of the way. President Clinton signed the Internet Tax Freedom Act in 1998. The Internet-Content group rocketed 1,240% during the Clinton presidency.


**Obstacles:** A president's economic policies can provide obstacles to both a particular industry and sometimes the whole economy. President Obama's administration essentially declared economic war on coal and on for-profit education. Over eight years, the coal group's stock price dropped 46% and for-profit schools slid 48%. In a less direct way, President George W. Bush's spending policies probably harmed the economy. Federal government spending increased 70%, and Bush vetoed few bills. Of the five presidents, George W. Bush had the highest percentage of industry groups that turned in a negative return (30.7%).


**Incentives and deregulation:** The top-performing industry group under Reagan was generic drugs, which rose 859%. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 made generic drugs more accessible, cutting prices for consumers. According to the medical journal "Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica," only 13% of prescriptions in the U.S. were for generics in 1983. By 2012, generics accounted for 84% of prescriptions.


**Unintended consequences:** Obama probably did more for the firearms business by accident — with his high-profile opposition — than any gun rights advocate ever did on purpose. Consumers, who were afraid of seeing access to firearms abridged, stepped up and bought more firearms than they otherwise might have. **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) and **Sturm Ruger** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)), the only two publicly traded firearms stocks, rose 1,050% and 832% in the Obama era.


After the election of Trump, who is regarded as more friendly to gun rights, the stock prices of Smith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger dropped as much as 28% and 27%, respectively, before recovering some of the losses. (*For purposes of this article, we treat the firearms stocks as if they were an IBD industry group rather than a small part of the Security/Safety industry group: The move in firearm stocks was too big to be ignored.*)


How should individual investors handle the so-called Trump stock market?


So far, savings and loans, banks, and semiconductors have been the leading sectors. Metals, transports and building have been the [fastest-rising sectors](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders/3-fastest-rising-sectors-could-offer-buy-opportunities/). You can track the leading sectors by going to the [IBD Data Tables feature](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) inside the Stock Lists section at Investors.com, then click on "Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables."


But there's no guarantee that those groups will ultimately be the biggest winners under Trump.


The groups that ultimately lead during the Trump presidency may not be evident at first. If individual investors are to profit handsomely in the Trump years, they should regularly monitor upward moves among sectors and IBD's [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) (within the Data Tables, click on "Industry Sub-Group Rankings"). The best stocks tend to show excellent industry sector and group strength. That's why IBD's stock tables are organized by top-ranking sectors first.


The addition of new industry groups also should be watched. For example, some groups, such as Retail-Internet, didn't exist in the Reagan era.


Without knowledge of how sectors and groups are performing, identifying the hottest sectors, the hottest industry groups and the hottest individual stocks in a timely fashion would be very difficult.


As always, investors should follow IBD's standard advice on stock selection: Wait for a strong market uptrend; identify the top groups or sectors in that uptrend; buy the leaders within the favored area; don't buy too far extended past a proper breakout point; monitor the best stocks for new bases, breakouts and buy opportunities.

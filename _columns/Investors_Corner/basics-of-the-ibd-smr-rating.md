When hunting for a great stock, don't ignore the importance of big sales. They help drive big earnings growth.

  

The SMR Rating, one of IBD's SmartSelect ratings, gives a quick look at whether a company's sales growth over the last three quarters, its pretax and after-tax margins and its return on equity are among the best in the market.

  

Those four variables are stirred into a stew to assign the stock a single letter grade of A through E. An A grade applies to the top 20% of stocks in the market, a B to the next 20% and so on through E. Most winning stocks will have A and B ratings. Most of the biggest winners will have A ratings, unless they are turnaround stories.

  

Investors should look for companies with year-over-year sales growth of at least 25% for the most recent quarter and preferably several quarters back.

  

Growth investors sometimes focus on earnings growth and overlook sales growth. A sharp CFO can manipulate earnings for a quarter or two, or a company can grow earnings by cutting costs. But these measures work for only a while.

  

Real sales growth occurs only when the company is selling more goods and services. And that's what a smart investor wants to see.

  

The company should have a return on equity (ROE) of at least 17%. ROE is a measure of how well management uses its capital and assets to build profits.

  

If a stock flunks the 17% test, new IBD research has found that the stock can still be considered first-rate if it has strong pretax profit margins, generally in the range of 17% to 20% or higher.

  

IBD evaluates sales and after-tax margins on a quarterly basis. It also checks sales, ROE and pretax margin for the most recent year.

  

If a stock lacks one of the variables because it doesn't have earnings in the past year, it won't have an SMR Rating. In that case, the stock might still be worth considering if it has a couple of solid quarters under its belt to prove that a turnaround is under way.

  

The accompanying table comes from a screen of top-rated stocks with an A SMR grade. Many of them also have high [Composite Ratings](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/705408-use-ibd-ratings-to-help-find-leading-stocks.htm?ref=MoreArticles). That's to be expected, since companies with high profit margins, sales growth and return on equity would also have high EPS growth and high [Relative Price Strength Ratings](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/705832-how-to-find-great-stocks.htm).

  

Investors.com has a screen in the Screen Center under the Research tab that allows users to sort stocks by SMR Rating.

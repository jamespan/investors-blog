"Wide and loose" sounds like some pass pattern a quarterback might call. But in the stock market, it describes stocks trading with large high-to-low swings in daily or weekly price action. It is the opposite of the small price swings, with closes usually spaced close together and often described as ["tight trading](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-smart-money-builds-tight-bases/)."


Wide and loose moves are great when they occur on the upside. When a stock stages a breakout, you want the action to be as wide as possible — hopefully a [gap-up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) type of gain in heavy trade. But wide moves to the downside, especially gap-down losses, send clear warnings. They are not always signals to exit a stock, but they instruct investors to pay close attention, and to keep their [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/lightning-strikes-twice-multiple-sell-signals-can-trigger-the-same-day/) close at hand.


To gap down means a stock begins a session, and remains for the entire session, at a price below the prior day's lowest price. The chart action tells you the stock exchange's market-makers and specialists were faced with a surge of sell orders and had to suddenly lower the price in order to attract buyers.


Not all gap-down moves or wide-and-loose losses trigger sell signals. If a leading stock is trading well above its 50-day moving average, a gap-down move can sometimes simply mark the beginning of a base-building process.


But if the move pierces support at the stock's 50-day moving average, it flashes a sell signal. The greater the volume behind the loss, the stronger the warning.



A wide loss also triggers a sell signal if it erases a double-digit percentage gain above a proper breakout point. One of the cardinal rules of preserving capital is [don't allow a gain to cycle into a loss](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/what-to-do-when-stocks-round-trip/). Wide, heavy volume losses signal that one or more [institutional shareholders](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/i-in-can-slim-methodology/) have suddenly decided to break camp. Best to exit the stock and wait to see whether other smart-money players join the exit strategy, or whether others decide to step in and support the stock's future upside.


A large, heavy-volume loss can also trip a sell signal on its own, without breaking support or erasing breakout gains. This solo sell signal occurs when a stock posts its widest one-day point loss recorded in a stock's entire run up. One at a time, none of these sell signals should necessarily divert an investor from a winning stock. But if they come in combination of two or more, it's time to play close attention.


Two different examples on the current market are **Macom Technology Solutions Holdings** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) and **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ICmtsi081417.png)Macom started showing wide, loose moves in April, breaking support in a 14% gap-down move April 26, before narrowing that loss to 7% **(1)**(the accompanying chart is a weekly chart; please also see the daily chart below). The stock has posted other 7% losses during its run, so it wasn't technically the largest one-day price loss of its run. But on an intraday level, it was the biggest drop. Plus Macom broke through support at the 10-week moving average.


The stock did not take time to base before breaking higher, compounding the sense of volatility. Shares dropped 7% in strong trade June 9, leading to a sharp weekly loss **(2)**, then again, in much stronger trade on July 27, resulting in a negative reversal for the week **(3)**. Aug. 2 was the death knell, down 25% and breaking both its 10- and 40-week averages with a single cut **(4)**.


Veeva opened June 9 with a 9% intraday loss, the largest move of its 16-month run. It then narrowed that loss to 5% by the close, a decline that on its own sent no warnings. The stock has since settled into a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) base with a 66.19 buy point.



The specialist in business- and data-management software for Big Pharma and biotech firms also formed a pattern called railroad tracks during the last week of May and the first week of June. This stalling pattern often chalks-off the top of winning stock runs. These corroborating signals suggest that Veeva should remain on notice.


Like Macom, further wide and loose action, or additional sell signals, would mark an abundance of warnings to lock in at least some gains or completely exit the stock.

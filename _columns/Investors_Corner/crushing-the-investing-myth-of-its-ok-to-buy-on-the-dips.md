One highly dangerous investing approach that all traders in growth stocks ought to think over is "averaging down."

It's one of the biggest myths in investing, particularly for high-growth companies. Don't confuse it with the cost-averaging method of long-term investing in a mutual fund or broad-based equity ETF.

When a high-octane growth stock has topped, rarely does it come back quickly and lead the next market uptrend. In fact, many stocks don't approach their all-time highs for years.

Just look at five former huge winners during the 1990s: **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)).

Intel this past week took out its December 2014 peak of 37.90. Yet shares are still miles below their August 2000 all-time high of 75.81. Qualcomm is up in 2016, yet it's still more than 37% below an all-time split-adjusted high of 100, seen in January 2000.

"Averaging down" means buying a stock, watching it drop and then buying more shares, resulting in a lower average price. You might hear people tell you that averaging down is a great idea, but in fact it's generally a risky way to operate.

These folks will say something like: "If you liked a stock at 64, then you should love it at 54." They could be referring to a former high-profile stock such as pioneering smartphone maker **BlackBerry** ([BBRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBRY)), formerly known as Research In Motion.

That makes some sense, but here's another way to think about it that could save you some pain: If a stock has fallen below your purchase price, then it's quite simply a losing investment. When the losses approach 7%-8%, cut the stock loose and find a better name. You can sell the stock even more quickly if you judge the price and volume action to be negative.

What if you ignore IBD's golden sell rule and instead opt to follow the stock lower? It means buying more shares could amount to throwing good money after bad, as the saying goes.

![ICrim092016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ICrim092016-1024x583.jpg)Let's say you had bought BlackBerry in January 2011, as the stock cleared a possible buy point at 64.04 **(1)**.

There were some flaws with this breakout, such as an overly deep base, but you jumped in anyway.

In any case, the breakout didn't provide much upside, and pretty quickly you would have had an opportunity to average down.

And this example shows why averaging down is often a bad strategy. BlackBerry continued to drop, so you really would have been throwing good money after bad if you added to your position in March **(2)** or April **(3)** or later.

You should have been selling your original position to avoid further losses, rather than adding to it. BlackBerry tripped some key IBD sell rules, such as by falling 8% below 64.04 and penetrating its 10-week and 40-week moving averages in heavy turnover.

Also, there's a big opportunity cost. By keeping your money in a dog, you're losing the chance to invest in a market leader.

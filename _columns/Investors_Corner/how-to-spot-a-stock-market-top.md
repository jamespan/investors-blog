The stock market collapse of 2000-02 was like a financial tsunami, with destructive proportions that rival history's worst bear markets.

The Nasdaq's top in March 2000 led to a 78% correction over 2-1/2 years, and the Nasdaq's 2000 peak has not yet been reclaimed.

Could an investor have seen the 2000 crash coming?

No one can predict the stock market.

Some gloom-and-doomers think they can, but repeating the same prediction year after year means little when it finally works.

Sound rules work better than predictions.

Rules can lead investors to the sidelines at the right time, while even accurate predictions can be off by months or even years.

If you follow the IBD method of counting distribution days, you won't need a fortune teller to navigate the market.

Your fortune will be safely on the sidelines as the long, ugly bear market begins to unfold.

What signs were apparent in March 2000?

A series of distribution days and stalling days pointed to trouble.

On March 7, 2000, the Nasdaq suffered a 1.2% loss in heavy, rising volume 1.

The sizable percentage loss in volume up from the previous session pointed to institutional selling. But the count was low at this point — no need to panic.

On March 10, the Nasdaq showed stalling action 2. The index jumped as much as 1.7%, then reversed to close with a 0.03% gain. This too pointed to institutional selling.

The next distribution day came on March 14 — a 4.1% drop in rising volume 3.

With three distribution or stalling days in six sessions, investors should've been raising some cash.

The Nasdaq tried to rebound. The index rose in five of seven sessions, then suffered another stalling day on March 24 4 .

With the distribution increasing, most disciplined investors would've increased their selling.

In the next session, the Nasdaq was virtually unchanged. Then it lost 2.5%, 3.9% and 4% 5 on March 28 to 30 — three straight distribution days.

Many IBD-style investors would've hit the exit on March 28, the fifth sign of weakness. And everybody should've been out of most if not all their stocks by March 30 as the market flashed two more red lights.

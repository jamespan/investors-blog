  Biggest Single-Day Point Loss May Signal Time To Sell

Bigger isn't always better when it comes to stock action. Investors usually welcome a sizable gain, unless they're shorting the stock.


But a big drop in heavy volume can be a red flag. In fact, depending on just how steep the decline is, it may even trigger a sell signal.


"If a stock already has made an extended advance and suddenly makes its greatest one-day price drop since the beginning of the move, consider selling if confirmed by other signals," IBD Chairman Bill O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Such action indicates a change in the stock's character. A sudden move down suggests that sellers now have the upper hand. If it occurs in heavy trade, that means mutual funds and other big players are likely selling shares.


Say a stock has been running higher for weeks, perhaps even months, and has sustained one-day losses of no more than three or four points during the run-up. Then one day, it sinks eight points, on a big spike in volume.


Consult a daily stock chart and compare the drop with previous declines that look sizable. If it is the biggest single-day point loss since the start of its run, consider locking in gains â€” the action may mark the end of the stock's run.


**Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) nearly tripled in price from an April 2013 double-bottom breakout past 49.11 to a Jan. 13 intraday high. During its advance, the stock fell more than eight points on Nov. 7, but stemmed its decline the next session and recovered to climb further.


On Jan. 15, Nu Skin sank 21 points, or 16%, in huge volume, slicing its 50-day moving average **(1)**. That's a sell signal. It was by far its biggest single-session point loss since the beginning of its six-month advance.


An article in China's People Daily criticized the personal care products marketer's business practices and alleged it's running a pyramid scheme.


Nu Skin gapped down and tumbled 26 points in even heavier trade the next day **(2)**. It undercut its 200-day line after the company warned its revenue would likely be hurt by a government probe in China, its biggest market.


Chinese regulators in March fined Nu Skin a smaller-than-expected \$540,000 for alleged improper business practices. The stock gapped up 14 points that day to recover its 50-day line, but has failed to make upward progress from there.


Nu Skin, which has been featured in IBD Leaderboard's [Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) since January, is back below its 50-day line and is 68% off its Jan. 13 high.

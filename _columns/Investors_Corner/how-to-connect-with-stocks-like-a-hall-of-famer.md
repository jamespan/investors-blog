Excellence in any line of work shares some common elements.


If you read what IBD founder William O'Neil says about investing and then read what Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer Ted Williams said about hitting, they are surprisingly similar.


In "The Science of Hitting" by Ted Williams and John Underwood, Williams talks about three rules to hit by.


**Rule No. 1: Get a good ball to hit.** Williams writes: "A good hitter can hit a pitch that is over the plate three times better than a great hitter with a questionable ball in a tough spot. Pitchers still make enough mistakes to give you some in your happy zone. But the greatest hitter living can't hit bad balls good."


Now consider what O'Neil teaches about stocks. CAN SLIM essentially defines the high probability, happy zone for the investor. If a stock has strong fundamentals and technicals and the market is providing a tailwind, then the investor is like the baseball player who gets a good pitch to hit.


If the investor insists on lunging for laggard stocks because they are the only available breakouts, the investor is inviting trouble.


"More often than not, you hit a bad pitch in a tough spot and nothing happens. Nothing. ... And before you know it you're making 50 outs a year on pitches you never should have swung at," Williams wrote.


**Rule No. 2: Proper thinking at the plate.** Williams writes: "You don't just 'guess' curve or 'guess' fastball. You work from a frame of reference, you learn what you might expect in certain instances. ... Certainly the pitch you anticipate when the count is 0 and 2 (a curve ball, probably, if the pitcher has one) is not the pitch you anticipate when the count is 2 and 0 (fastball, almost without exception)."


The stock market also requires proper thinking. The investor must have an understanding of the current market's strength or weakness, which sectors it is favoring and an understanding of the individual stock's personality.


**Rule No. 3: Be quick with the bat.** This rule, Williams contends, "applies all the time."


For an investor, recognition and a willingness to act is what makes an investor quick. The investor must be able to recognize a change in the market for good or bad and respond quickly and appropriately.


The bottom line for Ted Williams was quality and awareness of the situation. It's no different for O'Neil style investors.

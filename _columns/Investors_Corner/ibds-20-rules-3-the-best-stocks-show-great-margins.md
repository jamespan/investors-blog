_Third in a series_

At the right price, most products will sell.

Liquidation sales and garage sales testify to that.

Yet, strong sales for a company aren't always good news. You should always look at revenue growth in the context of profit margins.

If the only way a company can create interest in its product is by slashing prices, then that suggests that either the product has been commoditized or that the company has an inferior product vs. competitors.

The best companies make products or provide services that are so much in demand that strong profit margins are maintained while sales balloon.

Analysts differ on whether they prefer to look at pretax margins or after-tax margins. It's not a bad idea to weigh both.

Today we'll look at after-tax margins.

There are four ways to evaluate after-tax margin.

First, look for acceleration from quarter to quarter. Second, look for an increase on a year-ago basis. Third, look for after-tax margin that is at or near the company's historical peak. Fourth, look for an after-tax margin that leads its industry group.

Remember, the disciplined investor is looking for the strongest stocks, not a so-so stock.

Acceleration from quarter to quarter can be a positive, if it points to rising demand. If the company's products or services are highly seasonal, though, then quarterly acceleration or deceleration could mislead. A company might cut price seasonally — and consequently profit margins — to move merchandise on a seasonal basis. That's not necessarily bad.

So, it's wise to also look at after-tax margin on a year-ago basis. That way you are eliminating seasonality factors.

We studied a recent IBD 50 list. First, we looked for stocks that increased quarterly after-tax margin in the past three quarters.

There were nine: **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Barrick Gold** ([ABX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABX)), **Buenaventura** ([BVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BVN)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Eldorado Gold** ([EGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGO)), **Randgold Resources** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), **Hansen Natural** ([HANS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HANS)), **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) and **Royal Gold** ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)).

How do you check the above stocks for seasonality? Often a company will mention the seasonal factor in the 10-Q or 10-K report. Apple, for example, states in its 10-Q report that its fiscal Q4 ending in September and fiscal Q1 ending in December are typically its strongest quarters.

The second way we studied the IBD 50 was to look for stocks that increased after-tax margin on a year-ago basis in each of the past 14 quarters — that's three and a half years without interruption. Now that's a demanding test.

As the accompanying chart shows, stocks that meet that test include a handful of IBD 50 stocks.

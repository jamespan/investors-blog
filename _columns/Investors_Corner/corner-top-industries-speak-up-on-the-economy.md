Learning to listen to what the market is telling you is no small task.

  

Even the most experienced market watchers are still students, often humbled by an unexpected trick of the bull's tail.

  

Part of the learning process includes gaining a feel for how various industry groups and sectors of the economy move in rising and stressed markets, and how shifts in the relative strength of groups reflect the smart money at work in the market.

  

IBD's 197 Industry Sub-Group Rankings table provides an indispensable tool for studying such activity. What does that table tell us about the current market?

  

Until recently, the leading industries showed us the market adopting a stance like a tennis player standing at the baseline: on one hand, partially defensive; on the other, positioned for an uptick in economic activity.

  

On the bearish side, the market has seen defensive groups such as tobacco, diversified utility, bond funds and auto parts retailers staking out positions as top-20-ranked industries.

  

The more bullish plays were led by the return of groups such as apparel and shoe retailers and manufacturers, just as retail chains were building inventories ahead of the holiday shopping season.

  

Last week, the view turned somewhat more optimistic as aerospace/defense and computer hardware groups plowed squarely into leadership status. These are driven by bellwether stocks **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)).

  

When the market calculates an uptick in their fortunes, it is hinting at improvements that are likely to affect broad segments of the economy.

  

But the majority of leading industries continued, as of Friday's IBD, to present a semi-defensive stance among institutional investors.

  

One example: the electrical and diversified utilities, which moved into the top 20 rankings together Aug. 17.

  

Utilities act defensively, in that the stocks generally provide stable fundamentals and healthy dividends. But electrical utilities are also aligned to receive added benefits, as pending federal rules are set to force closing of aging coal plants. Analysts expect the result to be higher margins among power producers, giving investors both defensive and offensive aspects.

  

Medical software makers offer a similar dual boost, based on federal regulations requiring hospitals, clinics and physicians' practices shift to electronic medical records.

  

Internet retailers, and discount and variety retailers offer a different kind of hoof-and-paw stance. Both benefit from a hard economy and consumers striving to save every possible dime. But both groups also have growth prospects ahead of them, giving them potential upside when the economy begins to more seriously mend.

  Research Can Be Key To Success For Tech Companies

When studying a company's fundamentals, it's often a good idea to check its R&D spending. R&D stands for research and development. IBD looks at R&D costs as a percentage of annual sales. You can find the figure on IBD's minicharts (such as those in Friday's Your Weekly Review) and on [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com) charts.

  

Companies spend money on R&D to improve their products, processes and services, or to develop new products. Without R&D, it's hard to imagine the past decades' global advances in technology and commerce.

  

Not every company has R&D expenses. For example, you wouldn't expect **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)), the largest U.S. egg producer, to have R&D costs, and it reports none.

  

R&D isn't one of the top fundamental metrics that an investor should study, such as earnings growth, sales or [return on equity](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/754213-roe-measures-financial-efficiency.htm). But it's still worth a look.

  

R&D plays a key role in one [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) component. The N in CAN SLIM stands for something new, such as a new product or service. A good growth stock prospect should have something new that can drive earnings and sales growth. It often is going to take R&D to come up with new products and services.

  

If a company is in the biotech or technology fields, it's hard to imagine it enjoying continued success without R&D. The competition is likely to surpass the company's technology â€” quickly.

  

Of the 50 names in last week's IBD 50 elite list of growth stocks, 29 report R&D expenses. Nearly all of them are in technology, biotech or drug industry groups.

  

It costs an enormous amount of money to develop an important new drug and get approvals from regulators. So perhaps it's no surprise that the top two IBD 50 stocks in R&D expense-to-sales ratio are **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), at 45.1% and 31.7% last year. Both stocks boast strong Composite and other [IBD ratings](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) .

  

Investors are carefully watching Regeneron's pipeline drug Praluent, a cholesterol fighter under FDA review that is expected to be approved in July. Regeneron is developing the drug in partnership with **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)).

  

Celgene has relied on its cancer drug Revlimid, which accounts for two-thirds of sales. But the company said in its most recent earnings report that it expects new drugs and expanded uses for existing drugs to result in \$14.8 billion in sales by 2020. In 2014, those sales were \$6.6 billion.

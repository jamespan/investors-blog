Can someone with just a little savings learn to master the market and growth stocks like a veteran in [CAN SLIM trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) and turn that hard-earned cash into something substantial? Absolutely.




One secret ingredient? Discipline. Ingredient No. 2? Concentration. No. 3? A full understanding and conviction in IBD's seven-point investment system, [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Discipline means focusing your cash in the very best stocks, the ones that rise a lot and rise fast. These market lions enjoy long-term buying from institutions. IBD calls this accumulation.


The big boys and the big girls move stock prices on Wall Street. Mutual fund companies, large hedge funds and registered investment advisors with hundreds of millions, even billions to invest, seem to have the advantage. Yet an individual investor can still make money. Follow the [CAN SLIM system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), invented by [IBD chairman and founder Bill O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), of selecting, buying and selling stocks, to a T.


Note that the I in this seven-letter acronym stands for [institutional sponsorship and strong demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/). Avoid the penny stocks with bombastic promises from its promoters. Smart fund managers don't buy junk. Seek the high-quality names that the best funds are buying, and you boost your chances of making money.


How To Invest: Don't Avoid "Expensive" Winners
----------------------------------------------


Harness the power of growth stock screens such as the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), [Global Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/global-leaders/) or [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). None of the companies trade below \$10 a share. A high price is a badge of quality; a high share price also allows funds to deploy a lot of capital more quickly.


Don't let a share price of \$50, \$100 or more stop you from seeking shares in the best quality companies at the right time. The number of shares you buy does not matter. And this is where the second ingredient — concentration — comes in. An investor with up to \$5,000 to invest should really invest only in one or two names at a time.


Buying eight or 10 stocks costs dearly in trading commissions. The impact by just one of those stocks will be limited. Eight to 10 stocks makes sense in an account of say, \$200,000, \$500,000 or more, and when the market is in a strong uptrend.

By owning just one or two stocks, you must cut losses short, at 7% or less. We call this [the golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Doing so keeps you in the Wall Street game. Several winners that rise 20%, 40%, 100% or more will more than offset the bad trades.


How To Invest In Top Stocks: The CAN SLIM Trade
-----------------------------------------------


Let's say you opened a \$2,500 account at the start of 2017. You come across one of the year's top Chinese consumer spending plays, **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), No. 37 in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) in the IBD Weekly newspaper edition for the week of Jan. 23 that year. The [Inside The IBD 50 column](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) noted TAL as the biggest gainer, up 7.2% in the week ended Jan. 20.


You buy 190 shares as it breaks out of a base, [an 11-week double bottom with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), at 13.07 (adjusted for a 6-for-1 stock split) on Jan. 19. That \$2,483.30 investment (190 x 13.07) would have grown into \$3,368.70 by the close on March 24 as the cram school operator rises 36%.


A New Base? A New Opportunity
-----------------------------


TAL sets up again. It forms a [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). You go in again, buying 149 shares as the small-cap growth firm rushes past a 22.44 buy point on July 17. By TAL's recent close at 32.92, that \$3,343.56 stake is now up to \$4,905.08. With just two buys, your portfolio has nearly doubled in value, minus commissions.



No one is perfect. Let's say you had two duds after the first score. If you [kept losses small at 7%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), you still would have had around \$2,928 to invest in TAL for the next big move.

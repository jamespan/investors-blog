Is **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) getting ready to shift into overdrive and rally again? Shares of the auto parts retailer, up more than 33% this year, are working on a new flat base with a potential 278.06 buy point.


O'Reilly is outpacing most of its rivals. **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) is up about 20%. **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)) is down nearly 5% since Jan. 1.


And it's not just the stock that's outperforming. The Springfield, Mo.-based company sports the top Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings in its nine-stock [group](http://news.investors.com/business-industry-snapshot/091115-770640-auto-parts-stores-put-the-pedal-to-the-metal.htm). Where O'Reilly and its rivals used to mostly rely on the do-it-yourself shopper, the growing DIFM business is providing an additional revenue stream.


O'Reilly started the year off with a Feb. 5 breakout, an 8% gap up past a 196.90 flat-base buy point. It immediately went on to form a new flat base, which it cleared in mid-March. Since then, it's shaped and broken out of two more bases.


At its Feb. 5 breakout, the stock boasted a 97 Composite Rating; 95 EPS; 92 Relative Strength; Sales+Profit Margin+ROE of A; and B- for Accumulation/Distribution.


When it began to climb past a new flat-base entry on June 19, O'Reilly's ratings remained solid: 95 Composite, 96 EPS, 91 RS,SMR of A and Acc/Dis of B-.


And when the stock cleared its latest buy point on Oct. 12, its Composite Rating had risen to 99. The 95 RS and B Acc/Dis ratings also showed improvement.


Because O'Reilly already has cleared a series of bases over the past two years, its current pattern is late-stage, which tends to be riskier than earlier stage bases. Also, an up-down volume ratio below the neutral 1.0 level implies weak share demand. (See the ratio at [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup), found under the "Research" tab on Investors.com).


All the bases it's formed this year have been third stage, since the stock hasn't gained 20% from the breakouts.


Aside from the October 2014 **(1)** and February breakouts **(2)**, weekly volume has been rather tepid. Yet the chart shows numerous weeks of gains in heavy trade. Plus, O'Reilly has been finding support near its 10-week moving average as it trends higher. Despite the late-stage nature of its bases, the stock has offered investors chances to buy or add shares at breakouts and pullbacks to the 10-week line.


The number of funds owning shares rose to 1,341 in Q3 from 1,118 in last year's Q4. Plenty of top-rated funds bought a stake or added to their position in Q3.

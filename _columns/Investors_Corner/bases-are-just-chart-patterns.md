In stock trading, fundamentals tell you only what to buy but not when to [pull the trigger](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) investment methodology. It is also known as a price consolidation, which is nothing more than a set of price and volume bars forming a specific pattern.

While bases can be seen in daily charts, investors should spend as much time, if not more, focusing on weekly charts, too. Often, longer bases will show up more visibly to the human eye on the weekly chart.

Bases begin after the stock has been climbing, typically making new highs for weeks or months, and then starts to consolidate its gains. A pullback after a big run signals that some investors are anxiously taking profits off the table. A retreat can also occur as the general market starts to slip into a corrective phase. This sell-off creates the left side of the pattern.

A stock tends to bottom out in price when large investors, such as mutual funds, step in to buy shares. While it's not IBD's style, some value players will come out and buy shares when a stock gets beaten up. But at that point, it's too early to tell if the stock has truly regained its strength or will continue to head lower.

The key is to stay patient and wait for a pattern to develop fully. When the time to buy the stock comes, make sure that there is heavy volume on its breakout day â€” ideally at least 40% to 50% above average. Sometimes, trade can easily swell to double or triple the amount that the stock usually trades. If the stock finishes near its session high for the day in swelling trade, then that's exactly what you want to see.

The most likely bases that investors will encounter are the cup with handle, flat base and double bottom; future columns will cover all three. The most common pattern is the cup with handle, which looks like the silhouette of a shallow teacup with a handle. The pattern should be at least seven weeks in length.

From the highest price to the lowest within the base, the correction should generally fall between 12% and 30%. A slightly bigger decline is acceptable. The stock's handle should span at least five days and correct no more than 8% to 12%. It's good to see a handle, since it allows a stock to digest gains and sets up for the next leg up.

A [cup base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/746319-how-to-buy-cup-bases.htm) is almost the same as a cup with handle, sans the handle portion. Therefore it could be shorter, a minimum of six weeks in length. Cups are also pretty common. New issues go on to form [IPO bases](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm). They tend to be shorter and sometimes more volatile. IBD recently released an in-depth course on [trading IPOs](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/ipo-trading-strategies/?src=A3L2BEC).

Some ask: If more people learn about such bases, will the patterns become less reliable?

"In the stock market, history repeats itself," wrote IBD founder William O'Neil in "How To Make Money In Stocks." "This is because human nature doesn't change."

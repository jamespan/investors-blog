Short sellers can often make a wrong judgment about a stock. Quite wrong.




When these market participants finally throw in the towel and buy shares to cover their short sales, they can give a market leader extra fuel to rocket to new highs.


A [big breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), especially a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/), forces a short seller's hand. And when you see an enormous increase in trading volume, take it as a strong hint that serious short-position covering is taking place.


How can you find information that may set up such a situation?


[MarketSmith users](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) can go to the top left-hand corner of a weekly chart and find short interest data for all stocks in the IBD database. The number gives you an approximate amount of trading sessions — based on the current average share volume over the past 50 days — it would take for all the short sellers to buy and close out positions. The higher the number, the more shorting investors are doing.


When you wish to find great stocks, treat short interest as a secondary data point. The [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/), [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), [quality of mutual fund ownership](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-stocks-are-best-mutual-funds-buying-your-watchlist-stocks-how-to-find-out/), and leadership within a dynamic industry group carry much bigger weight in [CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).

What Is Short Interest?
-----------------------


How does short interest fare in the S&P 500? Tuesday data showed an average 2.7 days' worth of average volume; the median was 2.1 days. The IBD 50's median short-interest ratio is 2.4. **PetMed Express** ([PETS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETS)) at 9.4, **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) (6.6), **Innovative Industrial Properties** ([IIPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIPR)) (5.8), **Neurocrine Biosciences** ([NBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBIX)) (5.6) and **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) (5) ranked in the top 10.


The major exchanges report open short interest for equities twice a month. [NasdaqTrader offers a search function for Nasdaq-listed stocks](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest#:~:text=Nasdaq%20short%20interest%20is%20available,ET%2C%20on%20the%20dissemination%20date.).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wICtbl_070620-300x260.jpg)We ran a [MarketSmith screen](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) using these criteria: 1) average earnings per share in the past two quarters up 40% or more; 2) float of 10,000,000 shares or more; 3) market cap of at least \$300 million; 4) share price of \$20 or higher; 5) the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) must be higher than the 150-day moving average, which in turn exceeds the 200-day line; 6) IPO in 2010 or later; 7) and a 50-day moving average volume of at least 750,000 shares.


The screen collected 24 stocks; the accompanying table highlights those that show short interest of 2 times average daily volume or higher.


Another way to view short interest? Compare total shares sold short with a stock's float.


A high ratio, such as 15% or 20%, suggests that the shorts could also give a short-term boost in demand. Don't be surprised if you come across a ratio of 25% or more.

[Patterns To Market Wealth](http://news.investors.com/special-report/627625-patterns-to-market-wealth.aspx): Tenth In A Series

Every now and then, a leading stock forms a chart pattern that IBD calls a "high, tight flag."

It's a rare pattern, but if you happen to spot one, then buy the stock and hang on. You could end up with a big profit.

A high, tight flag has two parts: a flagpole and a flag.

The flagpole generally consists of a gain of 100% or more during a period of four to eight weeks. The flag comes as the stock etches a three- or four-week decline of typically 10% to 25%.

The breakout from this base occurs when the stock clears the peak of the flagpole in big turnover, meaning daily volume that's at least 40% above average.

How rare is the high, tight flag? It's typically seen only a few times during a bull market. That's what IBD's founder and Chairman William O'Neil says in his book, "How to Make Money in Stocks."

**Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) provided a strong example of a high, tight flag with its action in 2004, even though it didn't exactly match the definition for this pattern.

The Web search king formed its flagpole in August 2004 in its first few sessions of trading **1** after its initial public offering of shares priced at 85.

The flag took shape mostly through early September. **2** It featured a correction of 13% from a high of 113.48 â€” within that expected range of 10% to 25%.

Google broke out past its flagpole's peak of 113.48 in the week ended Sept. 17, 2004 **3** in higher weekly trade.

So where did Google deviate from the exact definition of a high, tight flag? With its flagpole, which didn't feature a gain of at least 100%.

Still, this is a great example of a leadership-quality stock that met the spirit of a chart pattern, even if the stock didn't match the definition perfectly.

Keep in mind that stock chart reading is both an art and a science, and this would be a case where the art comes more into play. In hindsight, it's clear that Google's stellar fundamentals helped offset some technical flaws in the base.

This was also an IPO base, or the first chart pattern formed by a new issue. Such bases often don't resemble a conventional base, so they can carry more risk. But they can still work out.

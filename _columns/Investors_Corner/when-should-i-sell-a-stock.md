  How To Use Volume To Tell It's Time To Dump A Stock

The toughest read in investing is recognizing when to sell a stock.


Many investment books will explain what kind of stocks to buy. Few, though, offer a sell strategy. An investor without a sell strategy is like a pilot without any idea of how, when or where to land a plane.


As this continuing series demonstrates, IBD has no shortage of sell rules. Key sell rule No. 19 is this: Sell the stock if it drops sharply in the heaviest volume since the breakout.


Sometimes the bad day also will involve the biggest price loss in the stock's entire run, but volume is the chief clue.


The heavy volume suggests institutions are selling. When institutions start selling, the individual investor can often assume that more bad days are ahead.


By using the bad day exit rule, the investor avoids the game of guessing the high. Sometimes a stock will advance after the bad day but the disciplined investor doesn't hang around to see.


Just as a disciplined investor will give up part of the early move to wait for a proper base, a savvy investor will give up part of the late gain to get out safely.


The idea is to play for most rather than all of the entire run. This prudent approach will increase the odds of success.


**SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) broke out of a base at 62.60 in June 2007. The stock advanced 30% in about seven weeks. When the stock hit the 20% to 25% profit level, an investor could've sold to lock in the gain.


After consolidating, a new opportunity developed when the stock retook the buy point and the 50-day moving average in late August **(1)**. Daily volume on the retake was 29% above average and 84% more than the day before.


From there, the stock advanced in nine of the next 10 weeks.


The bad day sell rule came into play on Nov. 8, 2007. The stock dropped 2% as about 6.3 million shares changed hands **(2)** â€” the greatest single-day volume in the roughly five-month run. This was a sell signal, pure and simple.


A sell rule is sort of like a cockroach. If an investor spots one, he or she can be confident that a closer look will find additional negatives.


The additional negatives might not be sell rules alone, but they do support the bearish scenario.


Investors might notice that on the day of SunPower's big loss in its biggest volume of the run, other negatives were present.


On the same day, the stock staged a negative reversal. SunPower rose 13% intraday and then reversed to the 2% loss to close low in the day's range.


Also, while marking the new high, the stock hit a mark 76% above its 50-day moving average **(3)**. Research shows that many leaders (though not all) will peak about 51% above the 50-day line.


Technically, the individual investor didn't need the additional negatives to conclude it was time to sell.


The market, though, added one more negative. On Nov. 8, the Nasdaq dropped 1.9% in rising volume, changing the Market Pulse to correction.


While a market in correction isn't by itself sufficient reason to sell a stock, it gave individual investors who sold SunPower confidence in that decision.

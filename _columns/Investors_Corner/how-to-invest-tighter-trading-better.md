Tighter is better. This is true for army cots, Ziploc sandwich bags and alibis. It's also true for stocks.


When trolling the market for great stocks, look for those with narrow weekly top-to-bottom spreads. Look, too, for tight closes. Apart from a small band, a string of weekly closes that don't stray far from one another also says good things about the stock.


First, they show institutional interest. When weak, impatient hands are unloading the stock, who's buying? At any given moment you simply don't know.


But if steady selling is met by steady, patient buying over the span of several weeks, those are the big-money funds at work.


In order to amass institutional-size positions in a stock, the funds can't just place one buy order for a million shares at the market.


If the market is not red-hot, they often just sit with bids just below the market to catch those shares that fall their way. And when the stock starts to rise, they don't have to chase it â€” yet.


At the same time, a small price increase may lure a few more shares from small-time sellers. But the big funds are patient; they stop buying as the price rises.


Naturally, the price stops rising. But remember, at this point there's plenty of demand for this stock, waiting in the tall grass. At some point, it must show itself.


That patient accumulation appears on the chart as tight trading. It could appear as a flat base or even a quiet handle on a cup. Wherever you see it, know you're seeing the fingerprints of big funds.


Tight trading also is a sign that the stock itself is hiding in the tall grass. Wild swings are the mark of a stock that has already caught the public's eye. There's no one left to surprise with a breakout.


And that's a big part of a breakout, catching prospective buyers off guard and forcing them to pay up.


Does that sound harsh? Better them than you.


Look at longtime leader **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), as it built a flat base from January through March 2004, which lies within a cup base. That base ran just 13% deep, which is already quite impressive.


But note the tight closes from the weeks ended Jan. 9 through Feb. 20. With great support along the 10-week line and volume drying up nicely, Apple showed it had no room left on the downside.

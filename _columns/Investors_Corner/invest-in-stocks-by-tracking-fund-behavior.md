[Fourth In A Series](http://investors.com/meetbigmoney)


Five hundred pounds, 800 pounds — it doesn't really matter. If there's a gorilla in the room, you really don't want to tangle with it. As in the stock market, you may just want to follow its lead.


The "I" in CAN SLIM stands for institutional sponsorship. The concept is that mutual funds, hedge funds and pension funds generate the bulk of the daily volume in high-quality stocks.


They buy and sell shares by the thousands, even by hundreds of thousands. Just a trade or two can exert a heavy influence on a stock.


When evidence suggests big funds are buying into a stock — particularly a basing stock — retail investors benefit by following along.


The most direct way to divine institutional behavior is to hone your reading skills for chart price and volume activity. You can also go to investors.com and see a stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating. The higher the grade, the better.


And an improving grade is a sign that the gorillas are on the move.


A more elaborate tool can be found alongside charts offered by IBD's sister service, MarketSmith.


A table on the left-hand side of a weekly MarketSmith chart provides the percent of shares owned by funds, banks and management. Going a step further, it shows the number of funds that owned the stock in the past four quarters. A fund's holdings are typically reported about six weeks after the end of the quarter.


To dig even deeper, click on the Related Information tab at the right-hand portion of the chart.


The first option under that heading, Ownership, opens a column that shows the percent of ownership by funds, banks, insurance companies as well as the amount of ownership by company management. It also gives an eight-quarter track record of how many funds own the stock.


If that number of funds is increasing, good. Accelerating is even better. If it is decreasing, take a close look at your stock's price and volume behavior and its accumulation and distribution data.


The risk in having heavy, institutional sponsorship is, if they all head for the trees at once (and they often do), the stock can slide into a death spiral.


Fabless chipmaker **Silicon Motion** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) provided a solid example prior to its first breakout above \$10 in September and October last year. Fund sponsorship wavered higher and lower through much of 2010. But the number of funds rose firmly in both Q1 and Q2, ahead of the breakout. As the stock was running higher, fund support continued to increase steadily through the fourth quarter.


Taiwan-based Silicon Motion posted an 84% gain from its September breakout at 13.54 to its Feb. 3 high. It is now consolidating below its 10-week moving average.

_13th In A Series_

It's a bad idea to follow just some of the rules of the road.

Let's say you obey the speed limits and stay to the right side of the street. But you're not a fan of stopping at red lights or slowing down at yield signs.

Well, that isn't going to end well.

It can be similarly bad if you take a pick-and-choose or a-la-carte approach to IBD's CAN SLIM investing strategy.

The strategy is designed for growth investors to follow in full.

If you pay attention to only 50% or 75% of the rules, you're likely to get hurt.

Even so, this problem — not following all of the rules — pops up a lot. It's a key psychological barrier to successful investing.

Many IBD readers fall into the trap of mixing their own biases with CAN SLIM, while also perhaps adding a few ideas from some other investing strategies, charting services or newsletters.

These investors — let's call them "overconfident mixers" — are sure they can create a hybrid approach that's even better than pure CAN SLIM.

It may in some instances lead to nice returns. But in general, it ought to be avoided.

For one thing, going that route could get complicated and confusing. CAN SLIM is already challenging enough to master without adding more layers to it.

Plus, there is already plenty in CAN SLIM. It incorporates the main qualities that growth investors should demand from a stock. It's a system based on what actually occurs in the market and how leading stocks act.

The strategy packs in a lot of requirements: big profit and sales growth (C and A), new conditions (N) and a sufficient supply of and demand for shares (S), as well as focusing on leaders (L), institutional sponsorship (I) and the market's general direction (M).

Over the years, IBD has found some trends among these overconfident mixers mentioned earlier.

They're often men. This dovetails with what some researchers have established about men and investing.

These experts have determined that men are more prone to overconfidence than women.

IBD also has found that the overconfident mixers also frequently are highly trained professionals who have accomplished a lot in fields not related to the market.

So if you would fit within this trend, take particular care to avoid becoming an overconfident mixer.

It's worth noting that there is some mixing that's OK — just not mixing up the CAN SLIM approach's main rules with other strategies.

For example, it's OK to take the CAN SLIM approach and apply it toward coming up with a nice mix for your portfolio.

You could use it to find a new issue with strong growth, such as **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)), a maker of network management software that has been highlighted in IBD's Leaderboard. It's No. 11 in the IBD 50.

You also could use CAN SLIM to spot another name that is growing but historically is not as volatile. One example would be drug developer **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), a big-cap stock that has often claimed a spot in IBD's various screens.

This kind of approach can result in a nice mix within your portfolio, in terms of growth and stability.

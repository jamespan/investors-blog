Reference points such as the North Star help navigators determine where they are and where they're going.


In investing, the guideposts aren't a point in the sky but a line on a chart — the 50-day and 10-week moving average lines.


These lines help give you a picture of a stock's longer-term trend. A rising line identifies strength; a falling line indicates that a stock is under heavy selling pressure.


The 50-day moving average is calculated by adding up the closing prices over the 50 most recent trading sessions and dividing by 50. It shows up as a line on the stock's daily price chart. On a weekly chart, the 10-week moving average is calculated by adding up the closing price in each of the past 10 weeks and dividing by 10.


Note that 50-day and 10-week moving average lines also accompany the volume bars beneath each stock's price chart.


After a stock has made a successful breakout from a proper base, it may pull back to the 50-day or 10-week line, then rebound off it in strong volume. That's a key place to add shares to an existing position, but only on the first or second time a stock tests the moving average.


Conversely, in many cases you should sell a stock that crashes down through the major support line in heavy turnover.


**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) cleared a 95.11 buy point of a flat base in the week ended June 22, 2012.


Bases that form mostly below the 10-week moving average should be viewed with suspicion. In fact, a stock should be trading above its key support lines when it breaks out — just like Alexion was — because it's a sign of the stock's strength.


The breakout came in volume that was 31% above the 50-day moving average. That's pretty good, but it's still shy of the 40%-50% minimum spike you'd like to see.


In such cases, your decision about whether to buy would have been based on your level of conviction in the stock and the health of the market at the time of the breakout.


Alexion rose 10% before pulling back to its 10-week moving average line in the week that ended July 27.


A stock that breaks out and then pulls back to its key support line can provide an opportunity to add a smaller amount of shares to an existing position, provided that the stock remains above its buy point and rebounds in above-average volume. In Alexion's case, the rebound came in volume that was 4% above the 10-week moving average **(1)**, enough to give an investor a reasonable amount of confidence.


From there, Alexion rose to a peak of 119.54 in the week ended Oct. 5, 2012 **(2)**, representing a 26% gain from the breakout in a little over three months. When a stock rises 20% to 25%, it's the right time to take profits and exit the stock.


Alexion's drop below the 10-week line in above-average volume during the week that ended Oct. 19 was a sell signal **(3)**. The following week's 11% drop in volume that was 147% above average **(4)** also signaled that it was time to exit. Never let a decent double-digit gain turn into a loss.


The stock went sideways for the next nine months, falling as much as 14% below the original 95.11 entry, before finishing a new base and breaking out in late 2013.

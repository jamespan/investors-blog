  Sector Leaders: An Honor Roll Of Future Big Stock Winners

Sector Leaders is IBD's toughest proprietary stock screen. It's so tough that in a rocky market few stocks can meet its stringent criteria.


If you spot a stock on the list (in today's IBD on B1), it's almost surely going to have EPS and Relative Strength ratings in the high 90s. Other SmartSelect Ratings are sure to be high.


IBD runs weekly minicharts of Sector Leader stocks each day in the paper, up to 16 charts at a time. All of the Leaders that meet the criteria can be found in the stock tables at the head of each of the 33 sector listings. But many sectors won't have any Leaders.


In recent days, a sagging market briefly reduced the Sector Leaders list to zero. A savvy investor has his or her powder dry during a bear market. Once the market turns up, stocks may begin appearing in the feature. You can be sure these highly rated stocks are worth further study. Many will make superior buy candidates. Always consult the chart to find proper buy points. Buying before a stock has formed a proper base and broken out, or buying an extended stock, is inviting disaster, even if the stock is highly rated.


The Sector Leaders screen has a superior long-term track record. Since the original follow-through day on March 6, 2009, the list has gained 355% vs. a 177% gain for the S&P 500, through IBD's Feb. 18 edition.


To gauge the strength of the market, investors should not only study the price and volume action of the major indexes, but also watch the action of leading stocks. Sector Leaders is a good place to do that. Is there a diminishing number of Sector Leaders appearing in IBD each day? Are these stocks showing poor action or weak Accumulation/Distribution ratings? That might mean the market is in for hard times.


That was often the case in late 2015. On Dec. 29, an article accompanying the Sector Leaders charts noted the weak Accumulation/Distribution ratings of of the six remaining stocks on the list. Only **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) had a strong B+ rating. **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) had a C; **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) each a C-; and **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) had a D, indicating intense institutional selling.


That was a wake-up call. The new year started with a sharp sell-off that has persisted into February.

**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) was an undisputed winner during the bull market that began in 2009. If you were scanning IBD's stock tables on Feb. 14, 2012, you would have noticed that Priceline was a Sector Leader, a member of the Leisure Sector that ranked No. 19 out of 33 sectors. The sector was already up 15.7% for the year.


The average EPS increase for the prior three quarters was 74%. The last quarterly report showed an 87% increase. ROE was 44%. The Composite Rating was 97;  the EPS a 99, the RS a 76. Strong overall. You would have noticed that earnings were due in a couple of weeks. That adds risk.


After a solid run-up in the first three months of 2012, Priceline cooled off to form a new long base. It finally broke out past a 745.34 handle buy point on May 10, 2013. From there, it made an 85% gain before topping at 1,378.96 in March 2014.

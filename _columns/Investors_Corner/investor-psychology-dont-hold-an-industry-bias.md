*Sixth In A Series*

  

Some investors routinely avoid certain stock groups or sectors because of a personal bias.

  

Try to become aware of the sectors or groups that make you uncomfortable. If you learn to expand your comfort zone, opportunities will bloom. Here are some common biases:

  

• **Technology:** Some people won't buy a tech stock because, "I'm not an engineer, and shouldn't you understand what you're buying?" Actually, the investor who understands how the market works grasps which fundamental measures are critical to a successful stock and knows how to interpret a chart will outperform those who understand how a product works.

  

We're not recommending ignorance as a strategy. Research is valuable. But if you had to choose between a sound understanding of the market vs. a sound understanding of a product, the market wins.

  

• **Gold miners:** Some investors avoid gold stocks because "gold has no intrinsic value" or because they associate such investments with gloomy survivalists.

  

The "no intrinsic value" argument has no value. Miners have been around for ages. Someday when pigs fly, a CEO will say, "We're closing because we just realized we're digging for something that has no value." Aversion to doom-and-gloomers also is off the point. Most gold investors aren't preparing for end times.

  

• **Pharmaceuticals:** The fear here is that an ethical drug is "only one bad FDA ruling away from a gap-down loss." There's a sliver of truth to this, but that's not an argument against buying drug stocks. It's an argument against overconcentration.

  

• **Upscale wares:** Frugal people will sometimes avoid the stock of companies that rely on sales of "products only a fool would pay up for." When **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) debuted on the Nasdaq in 1992, cheapskates said they and the world would never pay more than two bits for a cup of coffee. Wrong!

  

• **Oil:** Some investors avoid oil stocks, saying "How can anybody know where the price of oil is going?" You don't need fortune-telling skills to be a successful investor in oil stocks. Trust the chart.

  

In 2008, oil stocks led the breakout show. If bias kept you on the sidelines, you missed big gains, as the above chart shows.

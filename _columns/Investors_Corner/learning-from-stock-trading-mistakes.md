Sometimes, you have to take a step back to move forward. With a solid 2013 in the stock market now behind us, did you have a good year or bad?


Regardless of whether you trounced the market or underperformed it, doing a post-analysis of your trades will help prepare you for the coming year and beyond. It's an exercise that serves as a valuable learning tool.


As many will recall, school teachers often went over test questions after exams. You should do the same with your stocks.


Analyzing your past trades can help give you insights into what you did right or wrong. Sometimes you can see problems that you missed in real time.


These analyses can be done semiannually or quarterly, too, if you choose.


A post-analysis is not going to insure you against trading losses. This is just part of the investing game. But doing this work will make you more ready for the battle ahead.


There is no precise way to do a post-analysis. Each investor can tweak the outline below to suit his or her needs.


First, print out daily and weekly stock charts of every trade that you made. You might want to have one pile for winners and another for losers. While painful, losing trades will teach you more than winners.


On the charts, mark up where you bought and where you sold each stock. Jot down the number of shares bought and sold, average cost and total amount invested.


Also write down your reasons for getting in or out of the stock. You might want to note when the market staged a follow-through , when it came under pressure or when it started a correction. Next, go over each of those trades and examine the following:


• **Fundamentals**: Did the stock have quarterly earnings and sales growth of at least 25% in recent quarters? Had annual earnings climbed by 25% in the past three years? Were profit margins and return on equity among the best in the company's industry?


• **Leader or laggard?**: Did you buy the bona fide top dog in a high-performing industry group? Or did you go with a lesser choice because it was cheaper and you thought you had missed the leader? 


• **Market conditions**: Was the market in a confirmed uptrend? If so, was the market rally in any trouble? 


• **Technicals**: Was the stock in a proper base pattern, or already extended?


Was the price action in the base orderly and constructive or all over the place?


Did the base show accumulation (shown by weekly gains in high volume)? Was volume on the breakout at least 40% above average? Did you sell because the stock triggered a sell rule, or just because you felt the price was too high?


Once you've identified your mistakes, write them on the chart and have them close to you when you trade.


Or write them down on a piece of paper and stick them next to your computer monitor. Before you hit the buy or sell button next time, glance at your list and see whether you're committing the same mistakes.


One thing that helps you analyze your decisions is to keep a trading journal, in which you can note key facts that you might forget by the time you do your post-analysis.

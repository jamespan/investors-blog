Just like a basketball team needs solid players at all positions to win, many key factors go into a successful breakout. If a team has a weak center, it won't matter much even if the point guard is strong.


Likewise, a stock can show good price action, but weak upside volume or a lagging industry group can get in the way of a potentially powerful breakout.


"It is the unique combination of your finding stocks with big increases in sales, earnings and return on equity plus strong chart patterns revealing institutional buying that together will materially improve your stock selection," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


"The best professionals use charts," he added. So why not make like the pros and hone your chart-reading skills?


There are many factors to consider when looking for stocks to add to your watch list. The prior four [columns](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) covered a number of key fundamental and technical gauges.


To review, investors should focus on quality stocks. They should set a minimum stock price of \$10 a share. Stocks they consider should also trade at least 400,000 shares daily on average.


They should be one of the top players in its industry group, which should also be outperforming. On the technical front, the stock should be trading above its 50-day moving average ahead of a breakout.


Today we'll focus on a couple of more key traits to look out for when studying a stock's chart.


When a stock is building a base, you'll ideally see tight trading in quiet action.


Volume should rise as the stock works on the right side and at the breakout.


Heavy volume in the midst of the base, especially with wide and loose price action, is what you don't want to see. Quiet trade as a stock consolidates is good; it indicates the big money is holding or building a position. But big downside volume shows unwillingness among fund managers to hold shares.


To help determine if a stock is showing quiet action in a base, you can compare weekly or daily volume vs. the 10-week or 50-day moving average. The up-down volume ratio (in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup) at Investors.com) indicates demand for shares, too.


It's best to stick with stocks that have an up-down volume ratio greater than the neutral 1.0 level. A high ratio indicates institutional investors are grabbing shares.


[Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) stocks can make good watch list candidates. **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) displayed tight, quiet trade in its flat base ahead of its Jan. 23 breakout. One of the fastest growing players in the retail industry, Ulta joined Leaderboard on Jan. 22.


When it started basing in early December, there were five days of above-average trade. The heaviest volume occurred during a Dec. 18 decline, but was still relatively tame at 35% above usual **(1)**.


No more big-volume days came until Ulta broke out past a 134.60 buy point Jan. 23, rising 2% in volume that was 67% heavier than average **(2)**.


It was trading above its 50-day line before the breakout and led its Retail-Specialty group with a 99 Composite Rating.


After a brief pullback right after the breakout, Ulta has trended mostly higher; shares are currently up 22% from the breakout.

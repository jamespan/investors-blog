It can be tough to even think about sell rules, let alone ditch a stock that has enjoyed a long, steady climb. You might feel emotionally attached to the big moneymaker, like it's a dear family member.




You may sincerely believe the stock is a long-term super-winner, capable of doubling or tripling again. And sure, a few true market leaders will do just that, making normal price corrections along the way.


Yet never forget this: To wage outstanding returns in your stock portfolio, build up your skills in using [good sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) with discipline. After all, top-performing growth stocks can fall fast after they peak in price.


Do you know this sobering statistic? IBD research has found that once a top stock has reached its ultimate peak, the average decline from the top is a staggering 72%.

Mastering the selling side of the Wall Street game is just as critical as buying. So, after a stock has enjoyed a long advance, get ready to take profits when it crashes through a rising trend line.


Sell Rules And The Trend Line
-----------------------------



A properly drawn trend line connects three or more intraday or intraweek price lows over a span of at least 18 weeks. Typically, start the trend line at the low of the first pullback in price following a sound breakout.


A clean break of a trend line tells you that the stock's character has changed. It often occurs in conjunction with other sell signals, such as a [severe, sustained drop below the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-rule-is-the-stock-living-beneath-the-10-week-line/).


Trend lines drawn over too short a period could prompt you to sell too early. Why? Even the strongest stocks pull back many times during their run. The longer the trend line and the more points it connects, the more reliable it is.


Quality Systems, which in September 2018 changed its name to **NextGen Healthcare** ([NXGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXGN)) cleared a 55.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) (the accompanying chart includes a 2-for-1 stock split in March 2005) in November 2004 in heavy volume. With the [market in a confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), traders got the green light to buy stocks.


The Irvine, Calif., expert in electronic medical records software saw its first major pullback during the week ended Jan. 14, 2005. The stock sliced through its 10-week moving average and almost undercut its 55.60 [breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). That low marked the bottom of a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) that the stock cleared in heavy trade on Jan. 31, 2005.


QSII retreated for a second time after piercing its 10-week moving average in heavy volume in June **(1)**. But those who bought at the prior breakout could have held with a solid profit cushion.

That low also marked the bottom of a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) and formed the second point of a rising trend line.


The third retreat came in early January 2006. QSII again sliced through its 10-week line, though volume was light.


A yearlong trend line connecting the three lows from January 2005 to January 2006 showed that the stock should have been sold on Feb. 10, 2006, when it crashed through its 10-week moving average **(2)**. The stock also posted its [biggest single-session point decline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-signal-biggest-1-day-point-loss-can-mark-the-top/) in the highest volume since the run began — another key sell signal.


QSII slogged sideways for 2-1/2 years. The stock fell as much as 38% from its 2006 peak. It finally took out its old high in September 2008.

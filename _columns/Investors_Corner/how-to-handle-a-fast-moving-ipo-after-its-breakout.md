  How To Handle A Fast-Moving IPO After Its Initial Breakout

If a recent initial public offering breaks out from a base, should investors follow the same rules as they would for a more seasoned stock?


Not always. New issues tend to be more volatile, so some rules for handling such shares differ.


The [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-all-ipos-go-on-to-big-gains-heres-how-to-handle-them/) appearing in Tuesday's IBD discusses how to handle short moves produced by IPOs breaking out of bases. In today's column, we'll focus on how to play long moves that can occur following a breakout.


First, keep in mind that IPO bases can be shorter than conventional patterns. If a recent new issue breaks out from a period of consolidation and runs significantly higher over a few weeks, should you follow the 20% sell rule as you would with most other stocks?


Not necessarily. If the stock doesn't fall right away and advances 5% to 10% within the first few weeks of breaking out, hold it until the end of the eighth week. Don't confuse that with IBD's original eight-week hold rule, which suggests holding shares that long if a stock runs up 20% or more in the first two to three weeks of a breakout.


The move for an IPO can be much smaller. Once that eighth week has passed, then assess whether you want to hold, sell some shares or exit the entire position.


Let's say you decide to keep all or part of your stake. Now what?


Try to hang on to the stock until its first decisive break of the 10-week moving average.

For instance, if the IPO starts pulling back near your purchase price, take profits before letting all your gains evaporate.


If the stock continues to move higher after the eighth week, it may offer some follow-on buying opportunities. These are the same as with older stocks. You can add shares if a new issue clears a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/is-gilead-a-great-stock/), rebounds off its 50-day line or makes additional breakouts from sound bases.


**MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) debuted May 25, 2006, at 39 a share. It started consolidating after its third week of trading to set up a buy point of 50.73. The stock cleared an eight-week IPO base the week ended Aug. 4 in above-average volume. Within two weeks, it had advanced as much as 8%, so the eight-week IPO hold rule applied.


By the end of the eighth week **(1)**, MasterCard had gained up to 39% from the entry. The stock continued to rally, offering chances to add shares. Despite pullbacks along the way, the stock had run up 244% from the initial IPO base buy point when it made its first decisive break below the 10-week line **(2)** in the week ended Aug. 3, 2007.

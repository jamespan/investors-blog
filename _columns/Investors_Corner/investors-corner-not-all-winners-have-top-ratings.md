IBD's SmartSelect Ratings were created to help you save time in finding top-notch stocks. But occasionally a big winner may begin its rally with not-so-hot ratings.

Some stocks have broken out of bases and gone on to become some of the market's biggest winners, despite having an Earnings Per Share Rating below 80, a dry RS score or a lackluster Composite Rating.

We're not advocating buying mediocrity. Sometimes there are nuances that distort the ratings. Therefore, investors need to kick the tires and look under the hood before driving off with the stock.

Take the EPS Rating. This gauge compares a company's earnings growth in the two most recent quarters as well as profit growth in the past three to five years. Investors should focus on companies with an EPS Rating of 80 or higher.

However, if a company is a turnaround play or even lost money within the past five years, its EPS Rating will more than likely be depressed. You might overlook the lower EPS Rating if the company scored a big earnings increase in the past few quarters of the current year.

A company that loses money will also have no return on equity and no profit margin. Both of which will likely shove its SMR Rating down to a C or even a D.

Besides turnarounds, recent new issues with short track records of profit growth will have paltry EPS Ratings as well.

Elsewhere, a stock may have a Relative Price Strength Rating below the minimum 80 threshold if it's still basing over a long period, like a year or more, or as top leading stocks are breaking out to new-high ground.

This can happen since the RS Rating compares a stock's 12-month price performance against all other stocks in the IBD database.

**Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) had poor IBD Ratings: Composite 53, EPS 5, RS 69. The provider of network delivery services lost money from 2000 to 2003, but it earned 31 cents a share in 2004.

Despite the bad ratings, Akamai attracted investors for its innovative business model to help resolve Internet bottlenecks during periods of peak usage. The stock cleared a 15.66 buy point from a cup base on Sept. 30, 2005 **1** and surged 279% in 71 weeks.

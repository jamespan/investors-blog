One of the best and clearest sell rules is also one of the hardest to follow:

Sell into strength.

This rule shows the importance of selling a rising stock, rather than a falling one. This is a matter of exercising control and certainty, rather than guessing and hope.

The rule often goes hand in hand with an understanding of when a stock is signaling climax-top behavior. Such behavior consists of a number of traits that show a big rally beginning to sputter. They are clear sell signals to investors following the rule to sell into strength and lock in gains before the stock goes into a serious correction.

Over the summer, Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) began throwing sparks, signaling that even though its rally was steepening, its days were probably numbered.

IBD began to mention Ambarella's climax-top behavior in a [Sector Leaders Review](http://news.investors.com/investing/sector-leaders-review.htm) article published in IBD's June 9 paper. The stock was just breaking above its upper channel line, a climax-top sign.

Determining upper channel lines can be tricky and takes some practice. A properly drawn line connects the top price point of at least three distinct weeks with a rally lasting four months or longer. One catch is that you must use charts employing a logarithmic price scale, such as IBD charts in the [Stock Checkup tool](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) at Investors.com or [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com).

Ambarella also ended the June 9 session 97% above its 200-day moving average **(1)**. Gaps of 70% to 100% or more above the 200-day line signal that a stock is overextended and may be close to peaking.

As for Ambarella, the distance above its 200-day line on its own was not a sell signal. But it corroborated the break of the upper channel line.

Breaking the channel line requires a sudden acceleration of price gains, usually 25% to 50% in three weeks or less. This is a hallmark of climax action. Ambarella rose 43% in the three weeks to June 12. Also, that week and the prior week each stretched out to gains of more than 14%, among the largest in the rally and another sign of a climaxing run.

So, when, exactly do you sell?

The answer: now. If you got into the stock early, you could hedge your core position and just pull out the most recently added shares. But while paring back to the size of your early buy is smart, locking in more or all of your gains is even smarter.

At the session's close at IBD's first mention of climax-top action on June 9, investors who bought in at Ambarella's initial cup breakout in March 2013 had a 750% gain. Even those who only bought in at the stock's fourth-stage breakout in March of this year held an 80% profit.

Subsequent IBD articles continued to sound warnings as the stock pulled back to test its 50-day moving average, then sputtered as it hit a new high of 129.19 in July.

Investors who sold then watched shares sneak back for another test of support in quiet trade in mid-August. This time, Ambarella showed no resistance toward falling **(2)**. In the week ended Aug. 14, Ambarella closed 3% below its 10-week line. The next week, the gap swelled to 17%. In September, the stock unspooled by 40%, followed by another 14% drop in October.

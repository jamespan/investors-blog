  How To Use The EPS Rating To Evaluate Stocks

Wouldn't it be great if a company's earnings performance could be summed up in a single number that compares it to all other stocks? Such a wonder does exist. It's called the Earnings Per Share Rating, and it has been a staple in IBD for decades.


The EPS Rating encapsulates an amazing amount of number crunching: It takes a company's two most recent quarterly earnings, and profit of the past three to five years, then compares those results with all the thousands of stocks in IBD's database.


Depending on how well a company stacks up, its EPS Rating can go as high as 99. The worst earnings performers get a 1.


So the first lesson for investors is to focus on the stocks with the highest EPS Ratings. Typically, the market leaders have ratings of at least 85, so make that your benchmark for most stocks you consider purchasing.


Studies found that outstanding growth in the latest quarters, combined with a healthy three- to five-year profit history, form one of the most common characteristics of [winning stocks](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) before they make major price advances. That explains how the rating came to be formed.


Where To Find It
----------------


The EPS Rating is found in several places in IBD and its website, Investors.com.


In print, it appears in the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables. Various other tables, such as the Stocks On The Move, the Timesaver Table and IBD 50, also include the rating.


Online, it is most easily found by punching in the company symbol on the search box, by checking a current quote or by using [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) .


The Checkup lets you do some comparison shopping when you research stocks. The "EPS Rating" tab shows which five stocks have the best EPS Ratings in the industry group. This helps you determine if a company's EPS performance is truly among the best in its industry.


Keep in mind that a strong EPS Rating doesn't necessarily mean a company doesn't have problematic earnings. A sudden change in the profit picture may not register so quickly on the rating.


For example, quarterly EPS growth at **AutoNation** ([AN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AN)) slowed from 29% to 20% to 17% the past three quarters. On Jan. 6, 2016, the auto dealership chain warned it expected a drop in fourth-quarter gross profit for new and used cars, saying it was forced to boost incentives to entice consumers. On average, analysts now expect just a 5% year-over-year increase in Q4 earnings.


As of Jan. 14, 2016, AutoNation still held a high EPS Rating of 95.


The EPS Rating does not take into account earnings expectations. While that's a valuable piece of information for investors, it is after all just an estimate, and no match for actual results.


Moreover, some executives spend considerable energy talking down profit expectations, lest they become too lofty and leave the company vulnerable to a disappointing announcement.


Investors also should remember that the EPS Rating makes no allowances for companies that traditionally have smaller profit growth rates. So a company like **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), which has a steady business making consumer products, will have a mediocre EPS Rating. That shouldn't besmirch the company's reputation as a solid enterprise with stable profit.

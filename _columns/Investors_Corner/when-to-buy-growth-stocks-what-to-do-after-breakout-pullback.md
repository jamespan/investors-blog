Hey, savvy investor. Want a few tips on how to snare a gain of 20% to 25% in the best growth stocks?

First tip: Know how to analyze [a good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Then [spot the right time to buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

Second tip: In some cases, the market hiccups. Stocks retreat. But if your newest portfolio holding refuses to fall 7% or 8% below the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), sit tight. Then consider your new buy again. If you have shares in the No. 1 or No. 2 stock in a top-notch sector, generate the conviction to stand firm. If the stock market is in a [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), the odds of making money favor you.

Breakouts to new highs naturally spur some traders on Wall Street to take profits. But if institutional-quality demand truly exists, the selling should quickly subside. Look for signs that the big buyers are back in control.

These normal retreats back to or even slightly below the breakout point happen in roughly four out of 10 of the greatest stock market winners researched by IBD.

## When To Buy Growth Stocks: Match Goes En Fuego

**Match** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) has been an outright standout since it broke out of a first-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base with an 18.91 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in late August 2017. Shares have rallied as much as 404% to this year's peak of 95.32.

Since that peak, Match has corrected deeply. It's still forming the right side of a [brand-new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).

Given that superb advance, does it makes sense to think that [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in the later stage of this run would see some rocky action? Absolutely! And that was the case two months ago this year.

On April 15, the stock surged 5% and surpassed a 61.01 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in its nine-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), part of a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/). Volume zoomed 138% above its 50-day average. Despite closing the day at 60.18, below the pivot, April 15 was a good day for Match.

The next session, the stock dropped 3.9%. It gave back nearly all of the breakout day's advance. Volume was heavy. Time to sell? Nope. At the April 16 session close of 57.81, Match slipped more than 5% below the 61.01 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). At the session low of 57.39, the stock briefly stood 6% below the proper entry. Neither drop was deep enough to justify an exit.

## A Bullish Reversal, 14 Days After A Breakout

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wICmtch062819-300x170.jpg)The stock poked higher over the next several days, then retreated again in mainly skimpy volume **(1)**. Again, no sell signal triggered. On May 6, Match made a positive reversal. It turned a 5% morning loss into a 1% gain in accelerating volume **(2)**.

That lit up the rally. Match scorched the bears the next two weeks, rising 23% to a new high of 75.28 **(3)**. Those who bought on [breakout day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) were justified to lock in a rosy gain in five weeks of work.

At the breakout, Match flashed a 94 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) on a scale of 1 (the worst) to 99 (the best), an 82 EPS Rating and a 94 for Relative Strength.

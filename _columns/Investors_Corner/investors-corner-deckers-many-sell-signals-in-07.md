What do you think of when you hear a stock has been good to someone? You think the stock soared, and the buyer made a bundle.

  

But the bundle can only be kept when an investor pays attention to the stock's topping signals.

  

In this way, great stocks really are, well, great. On a stock chart, they'll often flash a flurry of sell signals after a long run higher. You might shrug off any one or even two of these clues, but when they appear in packs, you should heed the message your stock is sending.

  

Let's check out **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), a designer and marketer of its own line of shoes for outdoor activities and Ugg boots. The stock was a market leader for the two years through its top in late 2007.

  

For a full year starting at the week ended July 28, 2006, Decker paid almost perfect respect to the 10-week moving average.

  

When Deckers Outdoor broke out from a cup-with-handle base in the Sept. 15, 2006, week, it started flying from a first-stage base **1**.

  

It built two more bases along the way, both tight structures **2**, then another from Aug. 10 through Oct. 19, 2007 **3**.

  

That last base was a fourth-stage structure. In other words, it was a late-stage base. That's the first clue to consider unloading.

  

Here's another clue: Deckers' trading ranges widened sharply starting in August 2007.

  

For the 13 months since the breakout from the first-stage base, Deckers had been trading in a tight, orderly fashion. Suddenly, the stock started painting loose, sloppy strokes.

  

This is an especially negative development. Institutions, which had all this time been buying shares on almost any dip, suddenly pulled away that safety net.

  

Deckers Outdoor broke out from this late-stage cup-with-handle base in the Oct. 26 week **4**. Now the stock is rising too fast.

  

How so? Deckers Outdoor pierced the upper end of a rising channel **5**, a clear sign that the pace of gains is unsustainable.

  

What's more, the trajectory has increased markedly from the previous year's trek, one of the fingerprints of a climax top.

  

A look at the daily chart will reveal more signs of a climax top: two trading gaps, big one-day point gains and huge upside volume spikes.

  

Deckers was saying it's time to go.

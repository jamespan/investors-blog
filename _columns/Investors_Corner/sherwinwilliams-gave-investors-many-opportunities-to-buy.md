Stocks that have broken out of bases often give investors a chance to add to their positions as they pass certain milestones during their climb.

Such milestones include follow-on patterns such as a three-weeks-tight and a solid rebound off the 10-week moving average.

Adding a progressively smaller amount of shares as a stock rises is known as pyramiding, a technique pioneered by legendary investor Jesse Livermore to increase returns and reduce risk.

At the start, you would invest all of your allotted capital for a single stock when it breaks out above its buy point from a proper base. What if the trade is working well, and you want to add to your position? How much you add at secondary buy points depends on your conviction in the stock, your risk tolerance and the market's behavior. But the real key is to prevent the average cost of all your shares from rising too fast. It could expose you to potential losses fast if the stock falters.

**Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) cleared an 87.40 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on Dec. 21, 2011. Volume was dull at the breakout but grew in the next few weeks. Assuming that you had \$100,000 to invest in one stock, you would have easily been able to deploy all of that capital at the breakout.

Sherwin rose for 19 straight weeks before retreating to its 10-week moving average near 117 in late May 2012 **(1)**. That gave a first chance to buy more shares. Try to buy as close as possible to the 10-week line once you see a rebound taking place in fast turnover. At this point, you could invest somewhere between 10% and 20% of your initial position â€” in this case, \$10,000 to \$20,000.

With the smaller amount of shares added, the average cost of your position won't rise too fast. Buying on the third or fourth pullbacks is a no-no; the stock is at higher risk of a true correction.

Soon after its pullback, Sherwin began working on a flat base. Five weeks later, the paint maker cleared the 134.07 entry in the week ended July 27, 2012.

Since the base was proper in form and just a second-stage pattern, investors could have ventured an amount of capital that's smaller than the first addition. Since it was a new base, an aggressive trader could have created a brand-new full-size position.

You should avoid later-stage bases for the same reason that you should shun multiple pullbacks to the 10-week line.

Sherwin gave more opportunities to add shares, including a three-weeks-tight pattern in September 2012. At that point, the stock had already risen more than 60% from its initial breakout, so shareholders should have considered investing no more than, say, 5% or 10% of their initial position. The key is not to get too greedy. Always think about the overall average cost of shares.

Sherwin rose 123% to a high of 194.55 on May 14, 2013, before breaking through its key support lines and beginning a new base.

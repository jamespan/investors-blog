What is the most dangerous four-letter word in investing?




And can this simple word, so rich in context and meaning, really set you back as you seek to master the art and science of how to trade stocks? Yes. So, is it greed? Obviously not, although every player on Wall Street needs to get and stay mindful of this five-letter word. Owning too many stocks, or accumulating too much of one stock at the wrong time in the cycle can hurt.


Some would say the most dangerous word is fear. That's a great choice. The market, after a long dry spell, inevitably will signal the time to summon courage and buy stocks after a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/). But fear can unnecessarily stop you dead in your tracks: Fear caused by a normal pullback after a stock's initial breakout can kick an investor out too early.


Today's column focuses on this word: hope.


This emotion helps define what it means to be human. Hope for the best. But in the stock market, we should always prepare for the worst.


How To Trade Stocks: Rules, Not Emotions
----------------------------------------


Smart market timing, discipline and sell rules help guard you against this very harmful emotion — especially when a stock is no longer acting right. IBD's strategy involves buying stocks at or near their 52-week highs. But breakouts are not fail-safe. You need insurance — not hope — when things go wrong after you buy. [Keeping your losses small](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) is the "insurance premium" you pay to battle in the investment arena another day.


"The unsuccessful investor or trader is usually best friends with hope," Richard Smitten wrote in "Trade Like Jesse Livermore." "When it comes to the stock market, hope skips along the trader's path hand in hand with greed, but fear is always trailing along as well, hiding in the shadows."


"Hope has been and will always be an important survival technique for the human race. But hope, like its stock market cousins ignorance, greed, and fear, distorts reason," Smitten added.


Out Of Luckin
-------------


China's Luckin Coffee, which is no longer trading in the U.S., had a tasty run once it cleared a three-month oddly shaped cup pattern at 27.12 in the week ended Nov. 15, 2019. The so-called Starbucks of China even merited attention on the [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live) that launched that same month.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IClk090720-175x300.jpg)An 88% gain in 10 weeks? Spectacular. But also good reason to take profits on the way up. And when Luckin gouged its 10-week moving average near 36 in late January **(1)**, a [principal sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) triggered.


But what if you had hoped Luckin would climb its way back to that summit of 51.38? Well, a three-week rebound sent shares back above the 10-week line. The brief rally succumbed to more selling. When it undercut the January sell-off low of 26.75 **(2)**, all the breakout gains vanished again.


Wishing for another bounce did not pay off.


Shares got a delisting notice from the Nasdaq on May 15 in the wake of reports accusing management of artificially boosting sales.

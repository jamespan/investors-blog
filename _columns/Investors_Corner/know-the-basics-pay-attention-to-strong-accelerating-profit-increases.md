IBD research shows that the 600 best-performing stocks between 1952 and 2001 had one thing in common: strong earnings growth.

"During bull markets (major market uptrends), I prefer to concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or more," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

The "C" in IBD's [CAN SLIM investing system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) stands for current quarterly earnings. Companies whose profit is rising sharply tend to be those that are operating efficiently or offer superior products and services. Dell, Cisco Systems and America Online were among stocks whose big advances during the 1980s and 1990s were fueled by strong earnings growth.

Strong earnings growth is defined as a minimum 25% increase in quarterly earnings per share compared with the year-earlier quarter. Such numbers tend to produce an Earnings Per Share Rating of 80 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, a level that investors should look for when creating watch lists of the best growth stocks.

"You have thousands of stocks to choose from.Why not buy the very best merchandise available?" O'Neil wrote.

Accelerating gains are even better. Stocks with the best potential tend to have two or three quarters of increasing year-over year profit growth leading up to their breakouts.

"Our analysis of the most successful stocks also showed that, in almost every case, earnings growth accelerated sometime in the 10 quarters before a towering price move began," O'Neil wrote.

**Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)) showed accelerating earnings-per-share growth in the quarters leading up to its January 2014 breakout past a 28.66 buy point of a handle on a long first-stage consolidation.

![ic_swks_121916](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IC_swks_121916.png)From a decline of 2% in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September 2012, profit rose 8%, 14%, 20%, 21% and 22% in the quarters prior to the breakout. That's five quarters in a row of EPS acceleration.

At the time, Skyworks also possessed a 93 Composite Rating and a 94 Earnings Per Share Rating when it cleared the buy point. Another key metric, the SMR Rating — which stands for "sales, profit margins and return on equity" — was a robust A on a scale of A to E. (You can see all of these ratings at a glance and how a company sizes up against its industry peers in each of these measures by going to [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-skyworks-solutions-inc-swks.aspx).)

Skyworks offered investors several secondary buying opportunities en route to an ultimate gain of 294% to its peak of 112.88 in June 2015. New follow-on entry points included a couple of rebounds off its 10-week moving average. Buying on the first two rebounds off a stock's key support line carries less risk than those that occur further along the way up.

Later, in January 2015, Skyworks broke out past a 75.07 buy point of a three-weeks tight pattern, another follow-on entry, as earnings growth continued to accelerate, rising 54%, 75% and 88% in the quarters leading up to the breakout.

You can get a sense of a stock's earnings growth history by going to the Stock Checkup tab, located inside the [Research](http://research.investors.com/) tab at Investors.com. In the IBD Weekly print product, mini stock charts accompanying columns such as Inside The 50, Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight and Inside Big Cap 20 give the most recent EPS growth data.

IBD and Investors.com subscribers can go to IBD Stock Checkup and quickly see the three-quarter average in EPS change, the number of quarters of EPS growth acceleration, and the current year-over-year earnings estimate for the current quarter and current fiscal year.

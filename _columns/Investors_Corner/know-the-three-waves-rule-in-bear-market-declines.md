  How To Invest In Growth Stocks: Know The Three-Waves Rule In Bear Market Declines

Most classical music is written to the rhythm of three or four beats a measure. Having a set meter helps give a waltz or a symphony coherence and order. Coincidence or not, major market declines and the action in growth stocks also weave a similar pattern.




If you study bear markets, you'll see they didn't quite go down in one fell swoop, like a logging tree. Instead, they form over three or four waves of intense selling. Each wave is the product of human fear.


In between those selling waves, a major stock index might rally a month or two. That's a product of hope, mixed in with some greed.


As a savvy individual investor or a nimble fund manager, you want to shift to the sidelines as major market declines develop. So long as markets exist, new bear markets will surely arrive.

Also know this: IBD research shows the typical market leader, once it's finally topped, drops on average 72% from its high. Good reason to master your sell rules, right?

When The Bear Market Ends
-------------------------


So, when do you get greedy? First, read both [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) and the accompanying Market Pulse table every day to identify a [follow-through rally confirmation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). Second, be on the hunt for new market leadership.


In IBD Weekly and in the Research section of Investors.com, every story in IBD's B section is devoted to finding and following the market's true leaders. At the end of a vicious bear cycle, new winners supply the fresh legs of the next bull.


"Consistent strength and volume in a particular issue, occurring after a long general decline, will usually turn out to be an extremely bullish indication on the individual stock in question," [Gerald Loeb](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/why-gerald-loebs-battle-for-investment-survival-rings-true-in-todays-markets/) wrote in "The Battle for Investment Survival."


"In addition, if later its leadership is gradually followed by other important shares, the signal for a turn in the whole market probably has been given," Loeb wrote in the 1935 classic.


How Growth Stocks Should Act After A Bear Market Ends
-----------------------------------------------------


The great Nasdaq winners after the 2000-02 bear died echoed that wisdom.


After the Oct. 15, 2002, market follow-through, **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)), Gen-Probe (which used to trade via the ticker symbol 'GPRO') and SanDisk, acquired by **Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)) in 2016, led with big gains. Many others followed.


The Stock Market In 2019
------------------------


Going to the start of this new year, the market gave another signal that the current bear market may be ending.

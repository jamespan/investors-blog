Many factors can influence a stock's behavior, such as management, products and stock market conditions. But one of the most important gauges of a company's performance is earnings growth, as ServiceNow stock has shown.

That's why profit growth kicks off [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/), the investing system developed by IBD founder William O'Neil. We'll delve further into the C of CAN SLIM in this column, the first in a weekly series that will feature each letter of IBD's investing method.

The seven letters represent the most predictive elements that go into the success of a stock. That's been determined from decades of studies of the biggest stock market winners in past bull cycles. In doing so, O'Neil observed the role of strong earnings growth.

"Three out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the latest publicly reported quarter before they began their major advances," he wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

## C = Current Earnings

The C in CAN SLIM stands for current earnings. Specifically, investors should look for quarterly earnings per share rising at least 25% vs. the year-ago quarter in the most recent couple of quarters. The best growth stocks often sport a series of strong EPS gains before rallying to new highs.

Institutions view earnings as a barometer of a company's corporate health. Strong profit growth, especially in the most recent quarter, shows a company is also likely generating excess cash that can be used to invest for future growth.

Sales (or revenue) are also important. Similar to earnings growth, the ideal minimum level of growth is 25%. For very big companies that have already seen high-octane growth in their early years, percentage gains in the teens or low 20s may do the trick.

In some cases, you might notice that a company's rate of year-over-year EPS and sales growth rises from quarter to quarter. Such acceleration is a bullish factor that indicates the company is hitting full stride.

## ServiceNow Stock Breaks Out

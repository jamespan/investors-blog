**Top 10 Investing Myths:** [Last In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/604007/201203141812/top-10-investing-myths.aspx )

  

Investing is not an easy endeavor. The good news is that you don't have to be perfect to make money in the stock market.

  

You can have more losing trades than winners and still end up in the plus column. The key to doing this is money management.

  

You need a sound plan to deal with trades that go wrong and those that go right.

  

"The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you're wrong," wrote IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

Even if you have more losers than winners, you can still come out ahead as long as your gains are larger than your losses.

  

More specifically, investors should strive for a win-to-loss ratio of 3-to-1. That is, take profits once they amount to 20% to 25% and sell your holdings if you lose 7% or 8%.

  

Take a portfolio of four stocks with \$1,000 invested in each. If three stocks trigger the 8% sell rule, the total losses amount to \$240. But if one stock climbs 25% for a \$250 gain, an investor would still end up slightly in the black.

  

The 25% and 8% figures are not arbitrary numbers. O'Neil found that mostly leading stocks tend to rise 20% to 25% after breaking out of bases before they correct.

  

He also found that leadership-quality stocks will hardly ever fall 8% from a proper buy point in a sound chart pattern.

  

An 8% loss is the most an investor should take. You can also cut losses faster, depending on the market.

  

No one likes to take losses. But they must always be controlled if an investor is to make money in the market.

  

During this year's market uptrend, **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) cleared a 73.08 buy point from a cup-with-handle base Jan. 4 in triple its average trade.

  

While the oil producer pulled back soon after breaking out, it never set off the 8% rule. It then went on to a 33% gain before retreating to its 10-week line.

  

Cloud-computing firm **Rackspace Hosting** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)) cleared a 45.55 buy point from a cup with handle Feb. 2 in big volume. It rose 25% in nine days before pulling back close to its 10-week moving average.

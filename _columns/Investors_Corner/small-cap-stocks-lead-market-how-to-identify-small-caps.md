  Why Are Volatile Small-Cap Stocks Leading The Market?

Small-cap stocks have been outrunning the general market with gusto in 2021. As of Wednesday, the Russell 2000 small-cap gauge was up 17.5% year to date. The Vanguard Russell 2000 Index Fund ETF ([VTWO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VTWO)) had a 16.5% gain. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq had climbed 3.4%. The S&P 500 was up 5.1%.




It doesn't always work out that way. Small caps are more volatile than mid- or large-cap stocks. Sometimes that means big gains. Other times it means brutal declines. But it is good to understand the basics, and for investors to have small caps as an option in their tool kit.


So what are small caps? First, the "cap" in small-cap stocks stands for capitalization. Market capitalization is the value of a company, measured by multiplying the share price of its stock times the number of shares outstanding. If the total value is less than \$2 billion, the company is typically considered a small-cap stock. Capitalizations between \$2 billion and \$10 billion fall into the midcap category. Above \$10 billion indicates a large cap.


There are fluctuations. For example, the [largest stock in the Russell 2000](https://www.ftserussell.com/research-insights/russell-reconstitution/market-capitalization-ranges) in 2020 had a market cap above \$3 billion. Stocks in IBD's Big Cap 20 top \$15 billion in capitalization.

Small-Cap Stocks: Movable Objects
---------------------------------


Generally speaking, the smaller a stock, the easier it is for a fund or a group of investors to force it up or down. **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)) and **Express** ([EXPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPR)) were small-cap stocks when the WattStreetBets crowd first sighted in on the [short-squeeze targets](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/short-squeeze/). Express remains a small cap, while AMC has become a midcap, weighing in at \$5.92 billion. GameStop's market cap has swelled, at least for now, to large-cap status: \$15.15 billion.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IC032221-1-300x214.jpg)One of the underlying positives in the stock market is that, generally, most everyone wants the same thing: for stock prices to go higher. But when short sellers get involved, or large investors decide to take profits, small caps unwind much more quickly than do stocks with the largest number of shares.


While the CAN SLIM [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-best-sell-rules-current-stock-market/) for small caps are the same as for larger stocks, the small caps may trigger those rules with more unpredictable moves. [IPO](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/)s often start life as small caps. **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), for example, had a market capitalization of \$438 million at the end of its first day of trade in May 1997. Today, Amazon tops \$1.5 trillion.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) in 2002 [started life with a market cap of \$750 million](https://www.investors.com/research/netflix-stock-buy-now/). **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), a decade ago, just edged up into midcap status at its initial offering, ending its first day with a market capitalization of \$2.2 billion.


Small Cap Vs. Small Business
----------------------------


Small-cap segments of the market tend to do well when investors switch into a risk-on mode. Small caps — with a higher exposure to domestic stocks than larger companies — are doing well largely because Washington's \$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan will be injected directly into consumers.

There is one important distinction to be made here. The small, mid-size and large business designations used by economic researchers and government agencies are based on workforce size, not market capitalization. By this gauge, a small business has fewer than 100 employees. A mid-size enterprise has 100 to 999 employees. Big business is more than 1,000 employees. Do not confuse these measures with large-, mid- and small-cap stock designations.

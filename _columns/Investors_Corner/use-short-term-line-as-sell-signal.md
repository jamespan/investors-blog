**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

The [50-day and 200-day moving averages](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/757127-what-to-do-if-stock-breaks-50-day-line.htm) get a lot of attention and often are the most widely used for spotting key sell signals. Investors should also get to know the 10-day moving average, as it too can generate sell signals. Please note: This tool should be used only for short-term traders, who tend to be more active with entering and exiting trades.

  

Short-term traders are focused on capturing smaller moves, and thus they will not give a stock as much wiggle room as traders that hold on to positions for weeks to months or even longer.

  

Here are some sell rules in which to apply the 10-day line. **Rule 1**: Sell if the stock makes its first clean break below the 10-day moving average after gaining 20% to 25% from a base breakout.

  

This makes sense; many stocks correct after rising 20%-25% from a breakout. But note that this is a more aggressive exit signal. You're not giving the stock much leeway to do any more wrong after a period of strength. Sometimes, investors can use the break of the line as a sell signal even though the gain didn't hit 20% to 25%.

  

On the plus side, you'll be able to keep more gains if the stock starts a deep pullback after breaking below the line. During its advance, some stocks will trend above the 10-day moving average. Sometimes the breach of the line marks a change in the strength of the trend.

  

But other times, a move below the 10-day moving average won't be too serious. It will just give the stock a chance to digest gains, setting for the next leg up. There is always a trade-off when it comes to trading.

  

**Rule 2**: Sell if a stock takes out its 10-day moving average after posting a double-digit gain. The kicker to this is that it only applies if the market outlook, as noted in the daily [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) (today on B3), gets downgraded to "Uptrend under pressure" or "Market in correction."

  

Again, this is more of a cautionary sell signal. But recall that the M in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) stands for the market, which can have a big effect on how your stock trades. A strong uptrend will act as a tailwind and carry most stocks higher, whereas a harsh downtrend will push many issues lower.

  

Be sure to check out the Market Pulse and the Big Picture each day for changes in the outlook.

  

The 10-day moving average is a standard indicator that is included in most charting platforms. The line is also available on [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) and [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com/) charts. But both require separate subscriptions.

  

**GrubHub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)), a wild new issue from 2014, formed a cup-with-handle base with a 41.85 buy point earlier this year. Price action wasn't exactly tight, but new issues tend to be more volatile.

  

The stock cleared the 41.85 trigger Feb. 25 in double its average trade. GrubHub rallied 15% by March 31, but it also staged a big downside reversal that day. The next day, April 1, the stock sliced its 10-day line **(1)**.

  

Although it bounced back after that, a sell-off breached the 50-day moving average and erased the entire gain from the 41.85 entry, triggering two more sell signals **(2)**.

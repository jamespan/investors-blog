Even the best stocks don't advance in a straight line. They rise, pause and dip as they trend higher.

On a weekly chart, some of those dips are normal pullbacks, testing support at the stock's 10-week moving average. These present important buying opportunities.

The 10-week moving average is the sum of a stock's weekly closing prices over the 10 previous weeks, divided by 10. Calculated on a running basis, these lines are found on many charting programs. On Investors.com and [MarketSmith charts](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF), they appear as a red line.

The average marks a level commonly used by institutions to add shares to their holdings. Buying on such pullbacks helps minimize the average cost of shares as the funds increase their positions.

This was the case when Riverbed Technology, a leader in new-generation data networking, broke out of a 12-week cup-type base with a 16.45 buy point on July 23, 2010.

The stock pulled back below its buy point to touch its 10-week line. This was the first pullback **(1)**.

You generally want to buy only on the first and second pullbacks. Beyond that, there's a greater chance the stock will correct and leave you with a loss. It's best to wait for better buy points to emerge.

Pullbacks to the 50-day moving average, using a daily chart, can also be used to spot buy areas.

Riverbed's second pullback to the line, in October, was not picture-perfect. You'd like to see a stock settle toward its 10-week line in light volume, then rebound in heavy trading. Riverbed pulled back amid heavy selling **(2)**. It waited a full two weeks, then rallied again in strong trade.

When buying on a pullback, a stock is in buying range the minute it comes off the line. Weak-volume rebounds are not buying opportunities. Wait until volume kicks in.

You also want to buy before the stock is extended. Ideally, you'd like to pull the trigger before the stock climbs back to the high just prior to the pullback. In extreme cases, you can add a dime to that number, plus 5%, but often this is chasing the rebound onto thin ice.

A third pullback for Riverbed, in January, cut the line in heavy trade **(3)**. Too deep for a pullback, too short for a base, the pattern signaled investors to wait and see what comes next. Less than two months later, the stock peaked at 44.70 and created a base that was far too wide and loose. A breakout attempt in early July 2011 fell flat.

Riverbed barreled lower as the general market corrected sharply.

By October 2011, Riverbed slumped to as low as 18.33, 59% off its 52-week high.

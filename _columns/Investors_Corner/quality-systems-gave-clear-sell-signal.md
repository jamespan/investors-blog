It's understandably hard to sell a stock that has enjoyed a long and steady climb.


Yet it's important to know when to sell, especially since growth stocks can fall fast and hard without a lot of warning.


A key sell rule for a stock that has enjoyed a long advance occurs when it crashes through a rising trend line connecting three or more intraday or intraweek price lows over a span of at least 18 weeks.


A clean break of a trend line tells you that the stock's character has changed. It often occurs in conjunction with other sell signals, such as a severe, sustained drop below the 10-week moving average.


Keep in mind that lines drawn over too short a period could prompt you to sell too early, as even the strongest stocks pull back many times during their run. The longer the trend line and the more points it connects, the more reliable it is.


**Quality Systems** ([QSII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QSII)) cleared a 55.60 buy point of a cup-with-handle base (chart includes 2-for-1 stock split in March 2005) in November 2004 in heavy volume.With the market in a confirmed uptrend, traders got the green light to buy stocks.


The medical software firm's first major pullback came during the week ended Jan. 14, 2005, when the stock sliced through its 10-week moving average and almost undercut its buy point. That low marked the bottom of a new base that the stock cleared in heavy trade on Jan. 31, 2005.


Quality Systems retreated for a second time after piercing its 10-week moving average in heavy volume in June **(1)**. Shareholders who bought at the prior breakout could hold with a solid profit cushion.


That low also marked the bottom of a new base and formed the second point of a rising trend line. The third retreat came in early January 2006, when Quality Systems again sliced through its 10-week line, though volume was light.


A yearlong trend line connecting the three lows from January 2005 to January 2006 showed that the stock should have been sold on Feb. 10, 2006, when it crashed through its 10-week moving average **(2)** . The stock also posted its biggest point decline in the highest volume since the run began â€” more sell signals.


For the next 2-1/2 years, Quality Systems slogged sideways. It finally took out its old high in September 2008.


In all, Quality Systems' trend line stretched more than nine months and connected three lows as the stock more than tripled following its breakout.


In essence, Quality Systems' peak in early February 2006 occurred during the same week that the stock crashed through its trend line and the 10-week line.


While the trend line method might not get you out of a stock right at the top, it's been repeatedly shown to help you preserve profits in big movers. In the case of Quality Systems, it would have gotten you out well before the stock dropped as much as 38% from its 2006 peak.


Quality Systems' crash below its trend line came as the market's rally had come under pressure. It also coincided with the firm's much weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings report. Finally, the Computer-Software Medical industry group had started to slide, sinking to No. 36 out of 197 from No. 21 six weeks earlier.

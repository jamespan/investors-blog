When a new uptrend begins, individual investors should strive to do two things.


First, they should resist the temptation to pile into either the previous uptrend’s winners or the stocks that led during the bear market.


Leaders of one cycle rarely lead the next go-around. And stocks that did well in a downtrend are often too defensive to lead an uptrend.


Second, investors should identify new leadership.


Stock Spotlight (today's IBD on B9) is a good place to hunt. The stocks in this screen have good fundamentals and are either basing or hitting new highs.


The Spotlight screen is less stringent than the Sector Leaders and the IBD 50 screens. And that’s a good thing.


If the market uptrend comes after a long bear market, the Spotlight screen will pick up potential winners that have imperfect ratings but are getting their act together.


Let’s look at a classic example, the March 12, 2009, follow-through day.


What sort of stocks would an investor have found in the Spotlight screen?


Several stocks had been leaders, even during the bear market. They included **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) and **Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)). Car parts stores have defensive characteristics.


In the 12 months previous to the March 2009 follow-through day, AutoZone gained 41% and Advance Auto 18%. During the same period, the S&P 500 fell 41% and the Nasdaq slid 35%.


An investor might have concluded that auto parts might not be an ideal place if the market started rewarding boldness.


This proved true. After March 2009, AutoZone and Advance was rangebound before finding traction 12 to 14 months later.

Meanwhile, two stocks hammered in the bear market began to show promise: **Carter's** ([CRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRI)) and **Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)).


Success can go one of two ways.


A stock can become a one-shot wonder, unable to sustain positive action beyond that first breakout. Or the stock can deliver a long run.


Unfortunately there’s no way to know which will be which. You just have to play the game and respond appropriately.


Here’s a tip: When an uptrend begins, don’t forget to look for [trendline breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-read-stock-chart/). This is often the earliest chance to get into a stock.


On the follow-through day, Carter’s had cleared a trend line the day before. An aggressive investor could’ve entered around 18. A traditional handle entry came at 19.70. In four months, Carter's advanced 50% to 64%, depending on the entry. Carter’s, though, never developed a well-carved, second-stage base.


Cree cleared a 25.03 entry in a cup-with-handle April 1, 2009, best seen on a daily chart. The stock advanced 155% in almost 10 months, forming two bases along the way.

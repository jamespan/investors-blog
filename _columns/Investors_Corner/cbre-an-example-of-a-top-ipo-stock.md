Growth investors should seek to buy stocks in the early stages of their advances, but buying soon after an initial public offering carries risks.

IBD research shows that the market's biggest winners racked up much of their gains not long after going public, such as **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) did soon after its IPO of August 2004. That's because companies with new products, services or technologies tend to have their best periods of growth in their earlier years.

But usually it pays to wait a bit, because most stocks retreat after an initial post-IPO spike.

**Facebook's** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) stock jumped and tumbled after its May 2012 IPO, with investors having to suffer through a 15-month correction before the stock got back to its IPO price of 38 a share.

The lesson? Wait for the IPO to consolidate and build a base.

Normally, a proper base takes a minimum of five weeks to form.

But IPO bases can be shorter than normal and more volatile than normal.

**CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)), a property manager and loan originator for commercial real estate, went public on June 10, 2004, and began forming an IPO base in early August.

The buy point was at 20.10, or 10 cents above the left-side high of a three-week base that featured tight trading, with weekly ranges of less than 10%.

The calm trading was unusual for a new issue and gave the base some constructive action.

The stock cleared the buy point Sept. 3 in heavy volume. In the next five months it sped up its 10-week line, pausing along the way to shape a series of bases.

It hit a peak of 42.74 three years later, in the week ended July 20, 2007, representing a gain of 631%.

At the time of its breakout, CBRE's fundamentals were weak but improving, as is the case with many new stocks that have little track record.

But investors who looked at IBD's industry group rankings would have sensed that something was happening, as the real estate operations group had jumped to No. 6 out of 197 from 91 in just six weeks. This was the early stages of the property boom that sent CBRE and many other real estate stocks soaring.

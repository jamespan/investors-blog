Many leading stocks muscle through rough patches in the market. Given the choice, you'd like to find those that react mildly to market upheavals.

  

Why? Because unusually volatile moves within a base signal a genuine weakness of demand. It's the opposite of tight price action, which reflects conviction by institutional investors.

  

If you see a stock forming its base by going up 15% in a week but then falling 15% (or even 20%) the next week, skip the stock and find a better one.

  

In some cases, a base starts wide and loose but tightens up, resulting in an acceptable pattern.

  

Consider **Terra Nitrogen** ([TNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNH)) near the end of 2007. Rising corn and energy prices had lifted fertilizer stocks to record levels.

  

Terra had lodged one of the most blistering advances in the group, gaining 630% over the prior year. But it fell harder than most when the market hit some turbulence in July 2007.

  

Terra corrected 53%, including a chilling 25% drop in heavy trade during the week ended Aug. 3. **1** In the next week, the stock fell 15%. Even worse, the price range from high to low was a gaping 37%.

  

Terra scaled up to shape a handle on a deep, V-shaped base. **2** Despite the warning signs, Terra's prior advance, its healthy ratings and its backing by top funds still made it a tempting stock.

  

Trade settled for several weeks. **3** Then the stock took a deep dive in the week ended Nov. 9, losing 17%. **4** Although Terra found support at its 40-week moving average the next week, the wide-and-loose weekly action was exactly the opposite of the tight, calm trading you want to see as a base develops.

  

Terra rallied above the 134.65 buy point during the week of Dec. 14, 2007, but quickly reversed. Then it dove more than 8% below the base's 134.65 buy point. **5**

  

Tenacious Terra fans may have convinced themselves the stock cleared a new 139.85 buy point the week ended Dec. 28. **6**

  

The breakout went nowhere as the stock backtracked, building a double-bottom base through the end of March that also showed many huge swings. By this time, Terra was sorely lagging its rallying peers. The stock fell 62% from its high over the next six months.

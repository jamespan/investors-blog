With the start of the Memorial Day Weekend, now is a good time to catch up on your stock market reading. For stock investors, here are five classics worth a look.




**No. 1:** "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" is a biography of legendary trader Jesse Livermore, cleverly told by journalist Edwin Lefevre as a fictionalized first-person account.


Livermore was a pioneer in the study of buy points. He also saw the value in cutting losses short, in ignoring market rumors and in never adding to a losing position.


"Reminiscences" was first published in 1923, when Livermore had amassed a large wealth following his principles. He made a bundle after the 1929 market crash by short-selling stocks. But he later lost most of his money by failing to heed his own rules.


Livermore wrote his own book, "How to Trade in Stocks," in 1940.


**No. 2:** "The Battle for Investment Survival" was written by Gerald Loeb, a successful financier and a founding partner of E.F. Hutton. His 1935 book sought to educate individuals about finance and investments.


Loeb's strategy included buying only leading, actively traded stocks, not over-diversifying, and cutting losses. "Mistakes will be made. And when they are, there is no cheaper insurance than accepting a loss quickly," he wrote.


**No. 3:** "How to Make Money in Stocks" is the principal text on the CAN SLIM approach.


William J. O'Neil, chairman and founder of IBD, took the ideas of Livermore and other market greats and tested them through rigorous analysis.


From those results, O'Neil confirmed which concepts work. He developed his own rules that became the seven pillars of CAN SLIM. Those include the signals found in every market top and bottom.


**No. 4:** "How I Made \$2,000,000 in the Stock Market" was written in 1960 by Nicolas Darvas, a professional dancer who read about 200 books on investing in his off hours.


Darvas learned it was best to buy stocks with powerful fundamentals that were making 52-week highs. After polishing his method, he made more than \$2 million in just 18 months during the 1957-58 bull market. He used breakouts and breakdowns from price patterns to guide his buying and selling.


Most of his success came while he was on the road, thousands of miles from Wall Street. He made his decisions purely on chart action.


**No. 5:** "Tape Reading and Market Tactics" was one of the books Darvas liked most, along with Loeb's book.


Penned by Humphrey Neill in 1931, "Tape Reading And Market Tactics" taught the importance of volume in price movements. Advances should come in heavy trading, he wrote. But small gains in heavy volume represent "churning" — a topping signal.

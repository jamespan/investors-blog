  How To Trade: Base-On-Base Pattern Can Power Big Run

Desperate times often call for patience.


Leading stocks fighting to break out against a pitch-and-buckle market might take a little bit longer to set themselves up for glory.


One chart intricacy that often results is the base-on-base pattern. It often forms when a breakout succumbs to market pressure before posting a 20% gain. The stock falls into another consolidation, giving up some, if not all, of its gains.


To many investors, the move looks like an unqualified failure. But those clued in to base-on-base patterns keep a careful eye on the second consolidation, watching for a fresh buy point to appear. When it does, this second buy opportunity often signals an even more potent breakout and the launch of a winning run.


To qualify as a base on base, the second pattern's peak will be no more than 20% above the buy point of the first. Also, the floor of the second structure should drop to or a bit below the top of the first.


In a base on base, what matters is the condition of the second base. A tight, symmetrical formation may well be a go signal. A sloppy or flaw-riddled base may suggest the formation is not yet ripe.


The actual patterns in base-on-base formations can include virtually any base types.


Let's take the case of **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)). The fast-growing purveyor of goods for a buck or less didn't get far after breaking out of a cup with handle at 31.62 in August 2009 **1**. But a solid flat base formed over the next five months.


The decline from a 34.48 high to a 29.80 low on the base's left side was confined to 14%. Its new breakout in February 2010 **2** ignited a rally of more than 130%.


A base on base is counted as one structure because the bases are less than 20% apart. Also, a base on base isn't always a green flag. That is particularly true when the market is in decline or choppy.


A stock that barely clears its buy point, or clears then falls back immediately below the buy mark, may be set for additional consolidation. But if the subsequent pattern doesn't form atop the first, it is not a base on base.


If the second base corrects so deeply that it undercuts the low of the first base, it is also not a base on base. This action resets the stock's overall base count.


Stocks in late-stage bases often fail, and even if it's a great stock it may be on the verge of topping.

What is a support week?

In other walks of life, this may sound like a pivotal fundraising or human-capital campaign. The purpose may be to lift people or an organization during a time of crisis or great need.

This idea holds water in the realm of great investing as well.

If you are a dedicated stock picker and you focus only on selecting the best merchandise on Wall Street, strive to be a tenacious and diligent chart reader. This means examining a stock's week-to-week price and volume action with bloodhound-like focus, searching for clues that institutional investors are offering support to a stock in a decline.

To understand IBD's theory of the support week, you first have to accept this well-researched fact: The best growth stocks form [bases,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) or bullish chart patterns, after a long run-up. Bases give a hot stock time to cool off.

And bases will show numerous down weeks in price. Some drops will cut deep. But even weekly declines show subtle action of solid demand by pension funds, college endowments, banks and the like.

If a stock falls for the week, yet finishes in the upper half of its weekly price range, that's a support week. [William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), the founder of Investor's Business Daily, went so far as to say if a stock closes on Friday in the upper 60% of the week's trading range, that suggests institutional investors came in to scoop up shares when the stock went briefly on sale.

And what if you see volume surge in these support weeks? You've just witnessed a major shakeout. Truckloads of shares transferred from weak hands on Wall Street to strong hands.

## What Is A Support Week? The Case Study Of Visa

**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) showed at least two examples of a support week during the base it sculpted amid the brief bear market of late 2018.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ICV060820-300x161.jpg)Spy the week ended Oct. 12, 2018. Shares fell nearly 3.7% to 140.06. But an [IBD MarketSurge chart](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) notes the megacap posted a 61% closing range for that week **(1)**. In other words, Visa finished well in the upper half of the week's price range. The midpoint was 138.63. You can find it by simply adding the high (145.01) and low (132.26) and dividing by 2.

Another support week surfaced two weeks later **(2)**. After shares bottomed, Visa marked 10 up weeks in a row — another telltale sign of institutional accumulation **(3)**. Ahead of its breakout, Visa had sported double-digit profit growth for 10 straight quarters. The average EPS increase: a healthy 27%.

On March 11, 2019, Visa topped a 150.19 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in its five-month [saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/) base and rose 42% to a 214 peak in February of 2022.

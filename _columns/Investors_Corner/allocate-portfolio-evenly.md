  How To Allocate Your Stock Portfolio

One of the first questions a novice investor should ask is, "How many stocks should I own?"


IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil advises investors that too much diversification dilutes profit. But too much concentration can be dangerous, too. He says investors with \$20,000 to \$200,000 should limit themselves to four or five well-chosen stocks.


Let's say you have \$100,000 and you decide to own five stocks. You should allocate \$20,000 to each position, assuming the general market is doing fine. If you spot a top stock breaking out, you might plunk the entire \$20,000 into it, or you might scale in as it rises and presents add-on buying opportunities.


To illustrate the problems with too much or too little diversification, let's say you spotted **SouFun Holdings** ([SFUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFUN)) just before it broke out July 16. It had excellent fundamentals and had set up in a solid base.


But it makes you nervous. You've never heard of it, it's Chinese and it runs some kind of real estate website. So you decide to put just 5% of your money — \$5,000 — into it as it breaks out.


By Dec. 24 (when it reached its highest close of 2013), it had nearly tripled. Your \$5,000 investment had turned into \$14,900, bolstering your account to \$109,900. You bet on the winning horse and gained less than 10%.


But if you'd been braver and put in \$20,000, your investment would have been worth \$59,600.


Along the way, you've come to think Chinese stocks are great. You spot **NQ Mobile** ([NQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NQ)), which appeared to be breaking out of a high-tight flag Sept. 12. It's a sure thing, right?


You put \$40,000 into it. At first, your investment looks good as the stock runs up 20% in less than three weeks, falls back just below the buy point and finds support at its 50-day line. Then it rockets to a new high, and you know it's going to make you so rich.


At its intraday high Oct. 21, you're up 29%.


Then the unexpected happens. Around midday Oct. 24, a short seller puts out a negative report. The stock plunges 47%. You've taken a 40% hit, assuming you did not get a chance to cut losses short. You lost \$16,000 and your account now is at a deficit.


NQ was the trade from hell for many otherwise savvy investors this year. But if you'd maintained your discipline and put in just \$20,000, the damage would have been painful, but less so.

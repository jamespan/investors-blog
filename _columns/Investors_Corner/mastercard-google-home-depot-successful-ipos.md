You've learned in recent Investor's Corners that in many cases an [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) base doesn't look like a typical base. Market precedent shows that many new issues broke out from short, shallow areas of consolidation, ranging in length from two to five weeks.

  

In 2004, **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) soared out of a three-week IPO base and never looked back. And **Brocade Communications Systems** ([BRCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRCD)) consolidated for two weeks after its initial public offering in May 1999 before soaring to a new high.

  

Stocks tend to make their biggest gains in the early stages of being a public company. That makes sense since earnings and sales growth are usually the strongest in the early years. For this reason, it makes sense to target the IPO market for prospects.

  

When evaluating an IPO, avoid the cheap names and focus on institutional-quality, higher-priced names.

  

On the first day of trading, look for strong demand in the form of a large percentage gain. Some follow-through is good to see, too, so look for closes near highs in the first few days. A highly respected underwriter like JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs is also a plus.

  

Sometimes, IPO bases can look relatively normal. **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) went public at 39 a share in May 2006. The offering price was below the proposed range of 40-43 but MasterCard still had a solid debut, rising 18% to 46 on its first day of trading.

  

MasterCard cleared a shallow cup-shaped base during the week ended Aug. 4. At the time, its Composite Rating was 75 — pretty good for a new issue — and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was B+.

  

It was an easy stock to hold because MasterCard had a market uptrend working in its favor. A follow-through for the Nasdaq on Aug. 15 brought buyers in from the sidelines. A market tide flowing positively helped fuel the stock's ascent.

  

After a gain of nearly 50% from the buy point, MasterCard paid a visit to its 10-week moving average and soared 23% in the week ended Nov. 3 **(1)**. It cleared a base in early May 2007.

  

After a nearly 2,000% gain since its IPO, MasterCard is still holding its own. And why not? It's still a leading transaction processor in the U.S. and Europe with strong fundamentals. MasterCard doesn't issue cards or collect interest on unpaid card balances. Instead, it provides the networks through which card transactions are processed. Every time a card is swiped, MasterCard makes money .

  

So how does analyzing IPO bases from yesteryear help you now? Well, the IPO market has been vibrant in recent months. Every Tuesday and Thursday, IBD publishes IPO Leaders, a screen of new issues with good potential. IPO bases aren't hard to find here. 

  

**Summit Materials** ([SUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SUM)), for example, recently blasted out of short IPO base during the week ended April 17. So did **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) during the week ended Oct. 31.

  

**SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)), featured in the April 21 IPO Leaders screen, has been a big winner since its debut last month, but it hasn't formed an IPO base yet. It's trading tightly, though, so a new buy point could come along in no time.

  Add-On Stock Buy Is Useful Tool In Imperfect World

In a perfect world, an individual investor would load up on a stock in one single transaction and then watch the profits grow. Rarely is investing that simple.


More often, investors operate in an imperfect world. And in such a world, the add-on stock purchase can prove its worth.


The proper add-on transaction reflects smart portfolio management.


It involves a follow-up buy that is often smaller in total dollar terms than the initial buy. The add-on opportunity comes in several forms. The entry could emerge from a three-week tight pattern; a first or second trip to the 10-week moving average; or a new base.


The new base (or base-on-base) is probably the only time when the second buy could be as big as the initial buy, especially if the base count is first or second stage.


Here's why add-on buys are useful tools:


• Add-on opportunities emerge after a stock is working, reducing (but not nixing) risk of failure.


• Add-on buys let the investor bulk up a position. Sometimes conditions are unclear on the initial breakout. Maybe volume kicks in late. Maybe the market looks iffy. Maybe the stock has a few flaws.


Any and all of these factors can cause the investor to downsize the initial buy. The add-on allows for some catch-up.


• Add-on buys that fail can indicate trouble in the stock or the market.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) wasn't an obvious investing choice in the fall of 2014. Wasn't the stock kind of mature? Yes and no. Yes, growth that once rolled in at a 20% to 50% pace was now a 10% to 20% story. But no, Starbucks isn't a mature story in China, and the company is a leader in mobile orders.


In late October to early November 2014, Starbucks sketched a narrow handle (best seen on a daily chart) in a first-stage base. The buy point was 77.77, or a split-adjusted 38.89.


Things got tricky. Starbucks hesitated over the buy point in quiet volume. Breakout volume didn't come until Nov. 21, 2014, with the stock still in the 5% buy zone.


The stock moved up modestly and then formed a base on base. A January 2015 breakout offered a clear opportunity to add shares **(1)**. In April, a bounce off the 10-week line offered a second chance to add shares **(2**).


An investor could've sold on an ugly reversal on July 24 **(3)** (best seen on the daily chart), locking in profits of 45%, 32% and 18% in the three separate buys

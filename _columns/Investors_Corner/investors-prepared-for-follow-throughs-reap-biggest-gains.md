Three of the most powerful follow-throughs in recent times occurred in 1990, 1998 and 2010.

Two of them — on Sept. 1, 1990, and Oct. 15, 1998 — came during periods of financial turmoil or economic weakness. The success of those follow-throughs shows why it's important to tune out emotion and listen only to the market.

The follow-through is the market-bottoming signal discussed in this Investor's Corner series, which today looks at the results of these three follow-throughs.

The 1998 follow-through came shortly after Russia defaulted on its debt, setting off a chain reaction that led to the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, a giant hedge fund. The Nasdaq, which had hit a record high in late July, reversed course and lost a third of its value by early October.

The Oct. 15 follow-through came on the fifth day after the Nasdaq hit a low. The composite jumped nearly 5% in higher volume after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. The index rose 57% in less than four months from the closing price on the follow-through.

The day after the follow-through, LED-lighting stock **Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)) jumped above a 17.60 buy point and tripled. Other tech stocks also broke out and began big rallies. **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) both rose nearly 60%. Investment brokerage **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) staged a powerful rally, clearing a 28.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on Oct. 14 and rocketing 537% in six months.

The Oct. 18, 1990, follow-through came as the major averages started to emerge from a bear market in which the Nasdaq fell as much as 31% from its peak. On the day of the follow-through, the government released data showing that housing starts fell for an eighth straight month, the longest slide since 1959.

Yet the Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.7%, the S&P 500 2.3% and the Nasdaq 2.2%, all in higher volume than the day before. This movement confirmed the rally attempt that began with an Oct. 12 low and gave investors the green light to buy fundamentally strong stocks breaking out of sound bases.

In six months, the Nasdaq rose 53%. Microsoft jumped 71% in two months, and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rallied 62% in about four months.

The follow-through on Sept. 1, 2010, was accompanied by much less gloom, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rising 3% on a strong U.S. manufacturing report.

**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) were among many leaders that broke out shortly thereafter. Chipotle rose 70% in three months, while the Nasdaq rose as much as 19% in 51 trading sessions.

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and Apple broke out later in the month and also reaped big profits.

**Make Money With IBD Stock Checkup:**Â [Third In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/618220/201207251420/make-money-with-ibd-stock-checkup.aspx)

The language of losers is often the same, whether the setting is sports or stocks.

Baseball fans of longtime losers will talk about how good the team is going to be "next year."

A CEO at a laggard company will emphasize plans for the future, implying they are sure to pay off.

Investors should ignore the big, vague promises about the future and focus on the stocks that have big earnings now.

"You don't have to accept promises of earnings that may never occur," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

"Insist that both of the last two quarters show significant earnings gains. During bull markets (major market uptrends), I prefer to concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or more. You have thousands of stocks to choose from. Why not buy the very best merchandise available?" he adds.

Stock Checkup can help you find the stocks with big earnings.

Look at the listing, "Last 3 Qtrs Avg EPS Growth." If you see a red light next to the number, keep searching until you see a stock with a green light.

The "win now" investor also looks for earnings growth acceleration, or faster percentage growth from quarter to quarter.

Again, we go to O'Neil's book: "Our analysis of the most successful stocks also showed that, in almost every case, earnings growth accelerated sometime in the 10 quarters before a towering price move began."

Stock Checkup has a listing labeled, "# Qtrs of EPS Acceleration." Make sure you see a green light there, too.

A third EPS item that savvy investors look for is analyst estimate revisions that are rising. The Checkup labels this, "Estimate Revisions."

**OpenTable** ([OPEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPEN)) formed a seven-month cup-without-handle base **1** after its May 2009 initial public offering. The stock cleared an early entry at 33.86 on Feb. 26 **2**, but the market was in correction. A follow-through day and the OpenTable breakout occurred in early March **3**. Shares rose 108% in seven months **4**.

At OpenTable's breakout, the last three quarters of EPS growth were 100%, 167% and 1,300%.

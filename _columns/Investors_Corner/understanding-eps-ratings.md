Few concepts receive as much airplay in the investment trade as EPS, an acronym for "earnings per share."

  

Earnings, also known as net income, are a basic measure of profitability used by analysts and investors the way a chef uses salt or butter: all the time and in everything.

  

Earnings per share show a company's net income divided into the average number of shares outstanding during a particular quarter. This result gives a sense of profitability per unit of ownership.

  

Securities and Exchange Commission rules require that U.S.-listed companies report earnings on a quarterly and annual basis. At the most basic level, it's obvious that when earnings go up, that's good. When they go down or lie flat, it's bad. An accelerating rate of growth — particularly over recent reporting periods before a breakout — is best.

  

There are many nuances in learning to read and understand EPS data and in comparing performance to that of prior quarters and years. Dense terminology, such as GAAP earnings, operating earnings, pro forma net income, diluted EPS and EBITDA, can quickly become confusing.

  

IBD simplified the process for investors by developing the EPS Rating. The rating gauges a company's quarterly and annual earnings growth performance, placing more emphasis on recent results — especially the past three years of annual earnings and the two most recent quarters.

  

It then ranks that performance relative to all other publicly traded companies. A 97 EPS Rating means that your stock's earnings, overall, outperformed 97% of all other companies. A 13 rating means, well, keep looking.

  

You can find EPS Ratings at numerous places in IBD. EPS Ratings show up in stock charts on the IBD 50, the Big Cap 20, Your Weekly Review and other lists. They are also noted in the NYSE and Nasdaq stock research tables.

  

At Investors.com, EPS Ratings are available by using either the Stock Quote or Stock Checkup functions. They appear in all the lists found at the Screen Center and in numerous other places.

  

Generally, you like to see a leading stock with an EPS Rating in the 90s. But there are a number of instances, such as turnarounds or cyclical stocks, where attractive leaders haven't yet translated into high EPS Ratings.

  

In such special cases, stocks may carry EPS Ratings in the 70s. But sales and earnings growth estimates for coming quarters should be firmly higher, and the company should carry a long list of strong attributes to demonstrate a well-executed recovery.

  

Even a high EPS Rating must be supported by other factors. Some are fundamental, such as sales growth, healthy return on equity, and debt levels that are healthy relative to those of industry peers. Others are technical, such as a proper chart pattern and buy point, a strong relative strength line and rising accumulation.

  

But the EPS Rating stands out as generally the most important among these factors. IBD research into the 600 best-performing stocks between 1952 and 2001 showed that three in four reported earnings-per-share gains averaging more than 70% in the quarter right before they launched into their winning runs. This pattern provides serious food for thought and shows why EPS Ratings are a good place to begin searching for leading stocks.

Many investors are drawn to low-priced stocks like bears to honey. Truth is, it's an area of the market where institutional investors rarely fish. That means you shouldn't fish there, either.


Prior to today, seven columns in this space have addressed the question: What makes a great base? Today's column is a reminder that when looking for good price setups, make sure stocks are priced at least \$10 a share or higher.


Retail shoppers love bargains. But in the stock market, what seems like a bargain usually isn't. Cheap stocks are usually cheap for a reason.


Of course, it just sounds better buying 1,000 shares of a \$1 stock as opposed to 10 shares of a \$100 stock. The \$1 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a tidy \$1,000 profit. Meanwhile, the \$100 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a \$10 profit.


Which sounds better? The logic may be flawed, but it's human nature to favor cheap stocks. Of course, there are stocks priced under 10 in IBD's database that have compelling fundamentals. Some have excellent Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength and Composite Ratings.

But it's not easy making money in low-priced stocks. It's a risky area of the market because most low-priced names lack a critical trait seen in past stock market winners: institutional sponsorship.


Why do top mutual fund managers tend to shun low-priced stocks? Because they like liquidity, and cheap stocks rarely have it. Fund managers like to move into and out of a stock without being noticed. They can do that with liquid, highly priced names â€” not with illiquid ones.


Fund managers like to focus on firms with an exceptional track record of earnings and sales growth. This is not easy to find in the low-priced space, where many firms talk the talk but can't walk the walk.


It's not that money can't be made in low-priced stocks. It's just that the odds are much less in your favor.


Truth is, some of the most profitable breakouts can come from higher-priced names. Not surprisingly, since they're more on the radar of institutional investors.


**"Expensive" Often Is Not So**


The second half of 2012 yielded some powerful breakouts from institutional-quality names, as seen in the table above.


**MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) cleared a pre-split buy point of 448.10 in September 2012. For an individual investor, it may have been an easy stock to shun because of its price, but today it remains a true leader and shows strong institutional support.


**Mohawk Industries** ([MHK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MHK)) broke out a few months later, clearing a buy point of 89.38. It has risen 109% since then.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) was trading around 150 a share in August 2010 with a lofty P-E of 30 times trailing earnings, but that didn't impede the stock. Over the next 10 months, the stock rallied 118% from a buy point of 154.53.


It was no different in January 2013 as higher-priced institutional leaders like **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), **Sherwin-Williams** ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) and **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) broke out of bases and went on lengthy uptrends.

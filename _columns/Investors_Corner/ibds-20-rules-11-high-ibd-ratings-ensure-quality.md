Finding fundamentally sound stocks showing strong price action can take hours of research. That's where IBD Ratings come in.

  

Two key ratings, the Composite Rating and Relative Price Strength Rating, can help investors simplify their hunt for high-quality and top-performing stocks.

  

Investors should focus on stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 85 and up. In a nutshell, doing so will ensure that your target stocks have robust earnings growth as well as strong price performance.

  

IBD's Composite Rating combines several proprietary ratings into one gauge. They include the Earnings Per Share, Relative Price Strength, Industry Group Relative Strength, SMR (Sales + Margins + Return On Equity) and Accumulation/Distribution ratings.

  

More weight is placed on the EPS and RS Ratings. The Composite Rating also takes into account how far the stock is off a 52-week high.

  

The Relative Price Strength Rating helps point you to market-leading stocks fast. It compares a stock's 12-month price performance against all other stocks in IBD's database.

  

Both ratings go from 1 to 99, with 99 being best.

  

The CAN SLIM investment system is about buying stocks with top-notch fundamentals that are outperforming the market.

  

Sticking to stocks with Composite and RS Ratings of 90 and higher and 85 is just a start. You still have to do more homework and check to see if a stock is in a base or in buying range. Always make sure the market is in a sound uptrend, too.

  

**Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) busted out of a flat base April 5, 2007. At the time, the stock had a 98 Composite Rating and a 95 RS Rating. Its latest annual earnings surged more than sevenfold from three years ago. The stock's industry group was ranked No. 2 out of 197 industry groups.

  

The stock's base showed some tightness in the last two weeks and most of the pattern's price action was contained by its 10-week moving average. Traits like these are important and can only be spotted by studying the stock's chart. Potash surged 43% by late June before pulling back to its 10-week line.

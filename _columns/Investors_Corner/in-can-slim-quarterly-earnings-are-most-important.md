Investors prospecting for the next big stock market winner study many company traits, both fundamental and technical.


One characteristic stands out best as defining whether a stock is a potential winner: earnings growth in the most recent quarter or two.


Studies of winning stocks during bull markets over the past century show that the best predictor of whether of a stock was going to make a big advance is explosive gains in earnings per share before the big advance started.


Thus, the [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/) discipline tells investors to insist on companies with a quarterly year-over-year EPS increase of at least 25% â€” the bigger, the better. Triple-digit gains are best of all.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) had quarters of 300% and 433% EPS growth just before it broke out in March 2004 and began a colossal advance. As a new issue, **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) had earnings growth of 112% and 123% just before the stock [started its advance in August 2004.](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm)


Accelerating growth is also highly desirable. A company that grows earnings by, say, 25%, then 35%, then 50% in the latest quarter is doing something that few companies can do.


A study of 600 top-performing stocks from 1952 to 2001 showed that the average earnings increase before the stock made its big move was 70%. When an investor spots eye-popping earnings growth like that, he or she should sit up and take notice.


There are a few other things the investor should watch. Make sure that you're comparing year-over-year earnings per share, or EPS growth. It's EPS to which a shareholder has a claim, not net income or some other figure.


Exclude extraordinary or one-time items. We're interested in companies that are growing because they are selling more products and services, not because they sold some real estate. Earnings reported throughout IBD exclude one-time items.


On that same note, look for rapid sales growth, too. Again, you want your company to be growing because customers like its products or services, and are buying more.


Look at the numbers behind the percentage increases. An increase for a penny to 2 cents is 100%, but it's not particularly significant. EPS growth from a dollar to two dollars is.


Finally, if an EPS increase is unusually high or low, take a look at the result in the year-ago period. The company may have had an artificial boost or a tough year-over-year comparison.

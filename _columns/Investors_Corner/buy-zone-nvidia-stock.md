Learning new languages is tough. And learning how to invest and read stock charts, for most of us, certainly requires a new vocabulary.

A few terms often used in [The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-in-stocks-investing-for-beginners/) are: extended, buy range and shakeout. All are related. Readers of Investor's Business Daily and Investors.com typically see them on any day when stocks are climbing past buy points. An **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) breakout in the fall of 2017 emphasizes why the terms are important.

But first, a buy range or buy zone is a 5% area above a [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It is the zone in which investors can buy into or add to positions in stocks. The goal, whether the pattern is a base or a [rebound off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), is to buy as close to the [actual buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) as possible.

More advanced investors will use the buy range as a rule when [pyramiding into a position](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-pyramid-into-a-winning-position/).

A stock within 5% of a buy point is said to be in its buy range. A stock that has moved more than 5% above an entry point is considered extended.

So, the big question, why 5%? After a breakout, many of the best leading stocks have a tendency to pull back and test buy points or their 10-week moving averages. Marking a 5% cutoff allows these pullbacks to occur without triggering the [automatic sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/): when a stock falls 7% or 8% below your entry price.

## How To Invest In Stocks: Nvidia Teaches The Shakeout Lesson

That type of forced exit is called being "shaken out" of a stock. In short, buying within 5% of the buy point typically allows you to ride a normal post-breakout pullback, without being shaken out of the stock.

This is where chipmaker Nvidia comes in, with its breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) on Sept. 15, 2017. The stock scorched past the 174.66 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), jumping more than 6% in huge trade.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ICnvda052118-300x161.jpg)Despite the huge gain, the stock ended that day within the buy range that ran through 183.39 (5% above the 174.66 buy point). So, investors who missed that Friday breakout session could have come in on Monday and still bought. But only for a time.

Let's say an investor waited too long, and jumped into Nvidia later on in that Monday session, at 185. That's only 5.9% past the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Hey, what's the big diff?

## Not Crossing The Line

The difference would become apparent as the stock declined over the next five sessions. An investor who bought Nvidia's [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) at the highest possible price within the buy range — 183.39 — would have ridden a temporary pullback of 7.2%. Just short of the absolute kill-level decline of 8%, that would've avoided the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). He or she could ride out the test. At 185, the low of the pullback on Sept. 25 **(1)** would've been a shade over 8%. Shakeout time.

Another point: Nvidia remained in buy range over the next nine or 10 sessions **(2)**, giving investors plenty of time to pile in.

By its peak of 292 in early October 2018, the stock gained as much as 67%, allowing plenty of chances [to take profits on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).

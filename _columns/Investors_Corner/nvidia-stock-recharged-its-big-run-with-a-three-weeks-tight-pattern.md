A breakout is not the last chance to buy a quality stock. After it climbs from a base, look for the price action to tighten up for three straight weeks. For Nvidia stock, such a "tight" formation in April signaled that this year's monster run was far from over.




Once a stock breaks out of a [proper base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/) such as a cup with handle, double bottom or flat base, it's time to put on a full-size position.


While the stock is still advancing, look for three consecutive weeks of tight action. This means the stock is trading in a small range from highs to lows with little change in weekly closes.


That's the basic outline of the three-weeks-tight pattern. It is defined as three straight weeks in which closing prices are within a 1.5% difference.


The pattern suggests high demand for the stock, as institutions become reluctant to take profits. The buy point is the highest price in the three-week-long formation. Investors can use it to make an initial purchase, but it works best when used to add to an existing position — what's called a follow-up buy.


The addition would be a partial position such as one-eighth or one-fourth of your original purchase, depending on your confidence in the stock. By adding only a small position to your current holdings, it won't raise your average cost basis significantly.

Growth Stock Nvidia Shows Three-Weeks-Tight Pattern
---------------------------------------------------


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was undoubtedly a 2023 Wall Street darling, with its spectacular gain exceeding 200% through July of 2023.


Several three-weeks-tight patterns appeared during that run, but the April setup is a prime example.


![nvidia nvda](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IC2c073123-300x167.jpg)Shares broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in January **(1)** and rose in nine out of the next 10 weeks. Nvidia stock started to stall in March.


Its model three-weeks-tight pattern began the week ended April 7. In the next two weeks, the graphics-chip giant finished 1% lower and then 1.4% higher. The highest price within the pattern was 281.10, which became the buy point **(2)**.


Nvidia stock cleared the pattern in early May, just as it was finding support at the 10-week moving average **(3)**.


Nvidia reported a [stellar earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-rockets-to-the-moon-on-bullish-ai-fueled-forecast/) that sent shares up over 24% on May 25. By late July 2023, the stock was up about 60% from the April pattern.


The stock formed more tight patterns, including another in June and early July 2023 **(4)**. Nvidia's three straight weeks of price closes less than 1.5% apart made it a variation on the pattern called a four-weeks-tight.

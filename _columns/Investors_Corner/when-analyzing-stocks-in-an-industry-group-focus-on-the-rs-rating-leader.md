The workplace of the 1990s depended a lot on computers. So did that decade's great bull market.

From the start of 1990 toÂ August 1999, IBD's Computer-Manufacturers industry group of 22 stocks charged ahead more than 1,000%.

But a strong group is just one element in the search for the very best stocks. You want to find the leader in that leading group. And when it comes to PC makers, the winner back then is clear: Dell.

The performance numbers are almost too big to comprehend. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the direct PC seller's stock rocketed more than 81,000%.

The price for making the wrong pick? Through the end of August, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) rallied 85% (it later went on to surge in the fourth quarter of 1999). Micron Electronics (which has since changed its name to **Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU))) enjoyed big gains in the early 1990s. By August 1999, its decade-to-date gain reached 3,740%. Compaq Computer and Gateway turned in respectable gains of 780% and 890%, but those look puny compared with Dell's five-digit-percentage advance.

Dell's ascent wasn't a straight shot. Months of strong gains were followed by corrections and consolidations before the stock would break out once again. The result? Investors had many chances to climb aboard one of the decade's premier stocks.

Consider early 1998. Dell was emerging from a 3-1/2-month base that had taken the stock down 33% from its previous high. As the market recovered from the fall's steep correction -- a perfect time to search for fresh buys -- Dell was ready to resume its advance. How did it compare to its closest rivals, Gateway and Compaq?

One way to gauge the three computer makers was by their Earnings Per Share ratings, found daily in the NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables. The ratings go from 1 to 99, with 99 being the best. IBD's research has found that winning stocks have superior earnings before they make a big move. Dell was no exception.

At the time, Dell's EPS was top-notch at 99. Compaq was right up there with a 95 EPS, while Gateway trailed at 51. How fast do earnings grow in a 99 EPS stock? Dell's profits had surged 160%, 180%, 114% and 70% from year-earlier levels in the four quarters before its outstanding run of 1998.

Another important variable to check was the stocks' Relative Strength Rating.

The RS rating also goes from 1 to 99 and compare a stock's price performance with all other stocks over the past 12 months. Relative Strength is key because most best-performing stocks are already leaders before they begin to make a major move.

When Dell emerged from its base in February 1998 and eventually broke out to new highs, its Relative Strength rating came in at 97. Even though Dell hadn't made a new high in 3 1/2 months, the stock held up better than almost all other issues while the market recovered from its 13% plunge the previous October. That strength in the face of a weak market said a lot about Dell's potential once the broad averages started hitting new highs.

Compaq's RS stood at 92 in October 1997 and then fell to 86 on Feb. 2. The market correction left the biggest PC seller a little worse for wear. The decline meant that a growing number of other stocks were rising at a faster rate than Compaq. Meanwhile, Gateway's RS moved to 78 from 29, showing it was gaining strength but didn't measure up to Dell.

What if you had used conventional measures such as price-earnings ratios as your main selection criteria? You might have bet on Gateway, which carried a 30 P-E. Compaq was a little more ''expensive'' at 32. Dell, with a P-E of 35, may have been flat-out avoided.

Another mistake would have been to pick the cheapest stock at the time. In early February 1998, Compaq went for around 30 a share, Gateway at 40 and Dell at 100. Sure, with a \$5,000 investment, you could have bought 116 more shares of Compaq than of Dell, but that's irrelevant. You would have lost the chance at superior gains.

From the beginning of February 1998 to the following February, Dell advanced 320%. Compaq wallowed around before moving up 57%, while Gateway doubled.

Hindsight tells us that distribution problems at Compaq resulted in a huge inventory glut at the world's largest PC maker in the first half of 1998. Compaq's per-share earnings shrank from year-ago levels in the first, second and third quarters of 1998. Dell proved to be nimbler as it assembles its products only once an order is received.

But you didn't have to know all that at the time. What was apparent was Dell's strength, not only in its financial statements, but also its stock performance. By almost any measure, Dell was clearly the dominant stock in the PC field. As the market shows year after year, it pays to follow the leader.

Acer acquired Gateway in 2007. Apple was a longtime member of IBD's Computer-Manufacturing industry subgroup. However, since iPhones now make up the majority of revenue, Apple was moved into the Telecom-Consumer Products group earlier this year._)

The head and shoulders pattern is a well known formation that can tell you when stocks have peaked when it may be time to sell short. Learning how to spot potential shorts is an excellent tool for investors, especially in times where long setups are far and few between.




What Is The Head And Shoulders Pattern?
---------------------------------------


Just like with buying long, there are basic chart patterns we want to see that signal a potential price move. These chart patterns are key in deciding when to sell stocks short or identifying major tops.


When it comes to selling stocks short, the head and shoulders is one of those VIPs, or [very important patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/), that you must learn to spot. Aside from learning to recognize this pattern, which will come with time and practice, it's important to know the fundamental parts of a head and shoulders.


It consists of three tops, with the middle one (the head) reaching higher than the other two (the shoulders). The left shoulder, head and right shoulder should all occur in a five- to seven-month period. Also look for the right shoulder to be lower relative to the left shoulder and it should undercut the left shoulder.


A solid head and shoulders should be preceded by a major rally to new highs, and followed by a rapid drop below the 10-week average. This prior uptrend should be big, as in a rise of at least 300% to new highs. Ideally, the stock will have [broken out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from a number of [bases](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) prior to the head and shoulders developing. The more prior bases, the better.


Once the right shoulder has formed, start looking for an entry point on the stock. This is primarily a drop below the [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/), or sometimes the 40-week line, in heavy volume.

Investors can use the [7% to 8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) as a way to cut losses if the short trade moves against you.


Time To Sell Stocks Short?
--------------------------


If a stock is falling from its highs, look for a swell in volume on the downside. This indicates institutional selling and can be a strong indicator for further weakness in the stock.


![Dexcom chart](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IC2c_071122-300x161.jpg)Investors can use IBD's top research screens, like the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) or [Stocks On The Move,](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) to make a watchlist of winners that start to struggle. If you're seeing flawed cup patterns forming, heavy distribution among the major indexes and a current market outlook flipping rapidly from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure," be warned that a move lower may be on the horizon.


These are among the ideal conditions in which to sell stocks short.


Dexcom Test Cases Analysis
--------------------------


Last year, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) formed a head with shoulders that preceded a drop of nearly 60% from the top of the head to the bottom in May.


From the week of Sept. 3, 2021, through the week of Oct. 8, shares formed the left shoulder. Then, the stock rallied off the 10-week line to form the head. But during the week of Dec. 3, shares sliced through the 10-week line in heavier-than-normal volume. The right shoulder, which was slightly higher than the left, formed from the week of Dec. 3 through the week of Dec. 31.


The right shoulder also formed entirely below the 10-week line. Right after the right shoulder formed, shares proceeded lower once again, undercutting the 40-week line (not shown on the chart). This provided investors with a point of entry to sell the stock short.

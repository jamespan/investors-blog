**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

When a stock has been climbing steadily for many months, then suddenly starts to accelerate its move to the upside, watch out. The stock may be going into a [climax run](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/757735-how-to-read-climax-top-sell-signals.htm) or trigger another more subtle sell signal: the upper channel line violation.

  

An upper channel [sell rule](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735788) occurs when a stock gets extended from its long-term price trend.

  

Like with a climax top, an already strong stock starts to climb even faster. Both are offensive sell rules; they tell you to take profits on the way up as the stock hits new highs.

  

To draw an upper channel line, make sure you are looking at a logarithmic-scale weekly chart.

  

A logarithmic chart plots equal percentage changes in equal magnitude, regardless of the price. 

  

Start drawing the line from the peak before the stock's first pullback to its 10-week moving average after a base breakout. The line must touch at least three points. Generally, the longer and more well defined the channel, the more reliable the signal.

  

The channel line should extend at least 18 weeks. When it finally breaks through this upper threshold, the stock can be sold.

  

Many stocks, though, don't lend themselves to the drawing of proper channel lines.

  

It can be difficult to pull the sell trigger when a stock has done nothing but make money for you. That's why William O'Neil cautions in "How to Make Money in Stocks" that "acting on this is completely contrary to human psychology. Typically, you'll be happy as a lark and think the stock is going a lot higher."

  

**Fossil** ([FOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOSL)) broke out of a consolidation in August 2010 and made a sharp move up. Shares surged 210% in just over 11 months. Fossil designs and markets its own branded lines of watches as well as licenses with premium labels. It was riding high on fashion trends.

  

The first point in the upper channel was the peak in the week ended Feb. 11, 2011 **(1)**. That's the week before shares began to pull back to test the 10-week moving average after a flat-base breakout. The stock marched steadily higher over the next five months, turning lower after nearing the upper channel line in April and May **(2)**. In July, things really started to heat up and Fossil crossed the upper channel **(3)**. In the next three weeks, the stock plunged to 69.57, 48% off its high.

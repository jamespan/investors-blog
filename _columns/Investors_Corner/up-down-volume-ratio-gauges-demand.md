Before buying growth stocks, don't forget to check what the big money is doing. Since mutual funds and other institutional investors account for the bulk of a stock's price action, make sure that they're on your side.

There are a few ways to track their activity. The volume bars on a stock's daily and weekly charts offer a simple reading for the day's or week's action. If trading runs well above average, it suggests that institutions are involved in the buying or selling, depending which way the share price moves.

IBD's [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) indicates whether mutual funds are net buyers or sellers of a stock. Grades range from A to E: An A shows heavy accumulation (or buying) by mutual funds, a C is neutral, and an E points to heavy distribution, or selling.

This column will focus on a third accumulation gauge, the [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/). The ratio is derived from the past 50 trading days by dividing the total volume on up days by the total volume on down days.

## When To Buy Growth Stocks: How The Up/Down Volume Ratio Helps

A 1.0 ratio marks an even amount of buying and selling occurring over the past 50 days. A ratio above 1.0 points to heavier demand — or more buying — while a ratio below 1.0 suggests more selling.

That's why investors, when searching for watch list candidates, should primarily target leading stocks forming a solid base and showing an [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) of 1.0 or higher. Checking the ratio along with the [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) should help give investors a good handle on whether the big money favors a stock.

So where can investors find this key metric?

The up/down volume ratio is published on the bottom right-hand corner of the [Sector Leaders charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) in IBD Weekly, as well as in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) at Investors.com.

Click on the Research tab on the [Investors.com home page](https://www.investors.com/), then select [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), and enter a ticker symbol. Scroll down to the Technical Performance section, and you'll find the Up/Down Volume under the part labeled "Supply And Demand."

Ideally you'd see a strong ratio ahead of a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

## Growth Stocks And The Big Move By Gildan

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ICgilden122419-240x300.jpg)Investors watching **Gildan Activewear**'s ([GIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIL)) up/down ratio around early March 2010 would have noticed accumulation as the stock got ready to break out of a [nine-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) **(1)\*\***.\*\*

Shares of the T-shirt and sportswear maker started shaping the base with a 25.25 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in late December 2009.

Gildan's up/down volume ratio signaled accumulation, rising to 1.5 by the time the stock broke out the week of March 5. The ratio implied solid positive demand for Gildan shares over the past 50 days and may have helped investors decide to buy.

The stock broke out in early March 2010 and rallied 30% before pausing in late June to consolidate its gains.

By May 2011, it reached a peak of 38.06, up 50%.

Today, Gildan is trying to rebound after taking a massive 24% hit in the week ended Oct. 18, when the company issued weak profit guidance for fiscal 2019.

Shares on Friday ended at 29.55, 27% below a 52-week peak of 40.40.

For now, watch to see if the stock can complete a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).

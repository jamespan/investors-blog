The year 2003 was a very good year for stock investors.

The Nasdaq soared 50%, and the S&P 500 climbed 26%.

But the party couldn't go on forever. The key for investors was to notice when it was time to exit with most of their gains intact.

All market tops have one thing in common: an increase in distribution days, or days in which the market falls significantly in higher volume than the previous day. Just four or five distribution days within a few weeks can tip the market into a correction.

The end of the 2003 bull market began on Jan. 27, 2004 **(1)**, the first of two back-to-back distribution days. The Nasdaq dropped 1.8% in volume that was 12% higher than the day before. It was the first distribution day in six weeks for the tech-heavy index.

Most market-leading stocks continued to rise, including **Open Text** ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)) and **Sanderson Farms** ([SAFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAFM)). But the tone changed the next day, when the Nasdaq again fell in higher volume, taking **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Beazer Homes USA** ([BZH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZH)) down with it.

The market seesawed for several more weeks. But the Nasdaq racked up its third distribution day on Feb. 4 **(2)** after **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) gave a weak outlook. That day, IBD's Market Pulse switched to "Rally under pressure." But the uptrend resumed on Feb. 12, when the Dow hit a 32-month high in higher volume after **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) launched a takeover bid for **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)).

The next week was marked by low-volume movements that indicated the market was seeking direction. They ended Feb. 19, when the Nasdaq recorded its fourth distribution day **(3)**. (It was a distribution day for the S&P 500 too.) The Nasdaq picked up its fifth distribution day on Feb. 23 **(4)** and its sixth on March 2 **(5)**.

The market's failure to rally in higher volume while racking up heavy sell-offs was a tip that institutional investors weren't buying. Finally, on March 10 **(6)**, the market fell into a correction as the Nasdaq recorded its seventh distribution day.

At that point, the Nasdaq had fallen almost 9% from its January peak, and the S&P 500 had sliced through its 50-day line in heavy volume. Investors who had bailed out then would have suffered only modest losses, sparing them from bigger losses later on.

The Nasdaq dropped 19% from its peak. Open Text lost more than half its value in seven months. Amazon dropped 43% in the nine months following its January peak.

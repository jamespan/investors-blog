  Watch For Stocks Showing Strength In Down Market

In times of adversity, watching out for uncanny strength can pay off down the road.


When the market is in a correction, such as the one [right now](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm), don't buy stocks until a [follow-through day](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/702061-dire-market-headlines-occur-at-market-bottoms.htm) emerges. But you should also continue to watch the market and pay attention to stocks that hold up well amid heavy selling or buck the market's weakness.


The stocks that fall less during a down market will often lead the next rally. Think of it as a spring compressed by the weight of the market. When the weight is lifted, the stock is free to rise.

Top-performing institutions, such as mutual funds, pensions and hedge funds, like to buy companies that sell break-through products and services and are in growing industries.


In times of market corrections, those same traits, plus great relative strength, can make stocks future winners. If the broad market indexes tumble 5%, 10% or more from their highs, find stocks that suffered smaller losses, held tightly, or even ramped higher. On days where the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are deep in the red, look for those few issues that show strength in the face of adversity.


You can find these resilient names in Stocks On The Move at Investors.com or in the print version of IBD. The Bolting RS Lines screen from [Screen Center](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?nav=ResearchSC) on Investors.com points you to stocks doing well in a down market.


A single display of relative strength may not mean much. But if it keeps on bucking weakness, then that's a stock you want to put on your watch list. Also, check if the market makes a new low and a stock doesn't. If so, keep monitoring its price and volume action. Buy shares only if the stock breaks out of a good base or rebounds off its 10-week average in heavy volume.


Use every serious market decline as an opportunity to rebuild your watch list. Investors need to be ready to buy when either the Nasdaq or S&P 500 stages a follow-through signal.


Ideally, investors should be buying on the day of the follow-through and the weeks soon after. Either way, you should be ready to go with a shopping list.


The global financial crisis devastated stocks in 2008. From late May to late November, the Nasdaq plunged 49%. Tech leader **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was more than cut in half over the same period.


Yet while the Nasdaq plunged to new lows in early March 2009, Apple did not **(1)**. That was a show of true relative strength. It then rallied for nine straight weeks and the stock's RS line sprinted higher **(2)**.


After a pullback to its 10-week moving average and brief advance, Apple formed a five-week flat base. It cleared a 146.50 buy point on July 15, 2009, and rose 42% by October before another retreat to its 10-week line.

  Investor's Corner: Spot The Unconventional Buy Point

In a textbook breakout, big volume kicks in as the stock crosses a conventional buy point.

  

The conventional buy point could be established by a handle in a base, or a left-side high in a cup-without-handle, or a high within a flat base, or the middle peak in a double-bottom base.

  

Breakouts, though, don't always happen in a textbook fashion. Sometimes breakout-quality volume comes on the right side of the base — before the stock has cleared any apparent buy point.

  

If that seems to be the case, then take a second look at the chart. It's possible there is an alternative buy point that's being triggered.

  

One of the most common ways a base offers an alternative entry is by crossing a trend line drawn along the highs within the base. It should touch at least three high points. As always, volume must be at least 40% greater than average when it crosses that line.

  

Why look for alternative buy points? The shakiest time for any investment is right after the purchase. A lower entry point — if it is valid — gives the investor a little more elbowroom. It's harder to be chased out by fluctuations.

  

Assuming the overall action in the base is sound and that the alternative buy point line is properly drawn, the legitimizing element in an alternative buy point is volume. Without big volume, any advance past the alternative entry is just normal base-building.

  

In January 1979, Texas Oil & Gas began shaping a flat base **1**. The correction within the base was 8% **2**, well within the 15% maximum for a flat base.

  

The conventional buy point was the high of 36.50 plus 10 cents **3**. But a line drawn along the highs within the base provided a lower, potential entry point **4**. The alternative buy point was roughly 35.15 plus 10 cents. (Because IBD launched in 1984, there are no SmartSelect ratings available.)

  

Texas Oil crossed that line in volume that was 90% above average. It rose 164% above the alternative entry and 154% above the conventional entry in the next 11 months.

  

U.S. Steel bought Marathon Oil in 1982 and Texas Oil & Gas four years later. The company renamed itself USX in 1991. USX spun off the steel unit in 2001, and renamed itself Marathon Oil.

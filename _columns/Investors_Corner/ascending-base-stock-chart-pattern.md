It's always good to see a fundamentally and technically healthy stock "act right" after a breakout. It doesn't always happen. But when it does, it's easier to hold a potential big winner.

So, what exactly does "act right" mean?

Simply put, it's when a stock holds above a buy point after a breakout. Sometimes, a stock will break out, rally 10% or 15% and then move sideways, holding on to the bulk of its gains. Or a flat base can form, ideally showing a correction of no more than 10% to 15%. Or a three-weeks-tight pattern can take shape where each weekly close is within 1% to 1.5% of the prior week's close.

Another way a stock shows strength after a breakout is with an ascending base pattern. While not a common pattern, it can spark a big gain in a stock.

The pattern tends to take shape during market uptrends. It's not uncommon for market uptrends to go through periods of distribution. While some stocks might fall sharply, a few will surrender only a little bit of ground, push to new highs, and repeat this action.

The ascending base forms after a stock breaks out of an initial base. After that it pulls back three times, generally over a period of nine to 16 weeks. Each pullback can be anywhere from 10% to 20% (in some cases, a little more than 20%). This is key: The low of each pullback is higher than the preceding one.

The buy point is when the stock breaks out past the high of the third pullback by a dime.

**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) formed one in 1954 and went on to double in price. Mobile-home maker **Redman Industries** etched the pattern in 1968 and rose 500% in 37 weeks.

Retailer **L Brands** ([LTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LTD)), formerly known as Limited Brands, formed an ascending base in 1983 when the company was still in the early stages of growth. The stock rose for 10 straight weeks, forming a three-weeks-tight pattern **(1)** along the way, before settling into an ascending base. **(2)**

The first pullback was 13%; the next two declines were 17% and 14%. It broke out over a split-adjusted high of 15.19 during the week ended March 25 and doubled in just 15 weeks.

It's not easy to sit tight through a normal pullback, especially during periods of high market volatility. The tendency for many is to lock in quick profits too early. So the next time you see a powerful breakout, put or keep the stock on your watch list. It could be acting just fine and maybe even form an ascending base.

  Look For Highly Liquid Stocks When Selling Short

Highly liquid names are not only good candidates to buy in a bull market; they are also good candidates to short in a bear market. The individual investor can act without creating waves. But if a stock is thinly traded, an individual investor may have trouble avoiding big spreads between the best asking price and the best bid.


This is one advantage the individual investor has over the pros. The ordinary investor can probably dump an entire position in a highly liquid stock without creating even a ripple in the price.


**First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) debuted on the Nasdaq in November 2006. By the time the stock formed a 50-day moving average, daily dollar volume was \$28 million.


That was good enough to trade, but not what most investors would call highly liquid.


In the first nine months of trade, First Solar advanced about 400% from its opening day close. When it struck a high in late July 2007 **(1)**, daily dollar volume was \$283 million.


Now this was much better, but it wasn't all the stock wrote.


After a 39% deep consolidation, First Solar broke out and advanced an additional 160% in three months. At the peak, daily dollar volume was \$1.2 billion **(2)**.


First Solar was now a highly liquid stock.


The next base, which started in December 2007, was technically second-stage. A realist, however, would've call it late-stage.


How can a stage-two base be late-stage? Consider:


First, the overall advance was extreme. Second, an IPO breakout in February 2007 wasn't a valid base, but it otherwise showed the characteristics of a breakout from a consolidation.


Third, this stock was known to everybody watching the market. That's another characteristic of a late-stage story.


The late-stage breakout came from a base 49% deep, a negative. On April 7, 2008, the stock broke out past a 283.10 entry hesitantly. First Solar advanced 12%, then triggered the 8% sell rule.


By now, investors had a reason to sell, but not a reason to short the stock.


Short sellers didn't have to wait too long. On Sept. 4, 2008, the Market Pulse switched to correction. In that same week ended Sept. 5, 2008, First Solar knifed under its 10-week line at 267 in strong volume. Because this came after a late-stage failed base and with the market in a correction, the situation constituted a shorting opportunity.


A short around 267 would've netted a 34% profit in a few days.

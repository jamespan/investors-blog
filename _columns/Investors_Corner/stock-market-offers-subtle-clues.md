**How To Spot A Fine Chart:**Â [Second In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/609681/201204301622/how-to-spot-a-fine-chart.aspx)

Imagine you're driving your car, listening to the radio, and the stock market report comes on.

The news reader says, "Stocks were mostly down today as the Dow and the S&P 500 fell slightly and the Nasdaq rose one point."

That's it. The news reader then moves on to a bigger story.

Yet, it's on such days that the astute chart reader will sometimes see something important.

March 21 was such a day.

On the surface, there wasn't any reason for investors to think anything important happened in the market that day.

The indexes had been in a confirmed uptrend since Dec. 20. The Nasdaq began the day with its distribution day count at two. And one day was about to expire because of age. Yet investors, who track the indexes closely, noticed a very fine point in the market's action.

The Nasdaq advanced 0.5% intraday and then reversed to close low in the day's range, settling for a gain of less than 0.1%. Volume rose.

Why was this important?

The Nasdaq's action matched the definition of stalling: Heavier volume without price progress. This was distribution, but distribution that is easily overlooked.

Why easy to overlook? Because this kind of distribution happens when the index is rising.

This one day of distribution wasn't enough to immediately tip the Market Pulse to correction. But it was one more piece in putting together the market puzzle.

In five of the next 10 sessions, one or more indexes suffered distribution. And the market fell into correction.

Sometimes a fine point pertains to the action of an individual stock rather than an index.

For example, volume can offer clues when a stock is bottoming.

China's search engine **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) was sketching a potential base in 2007. The decline began in January, and the stock lost its 10-week moving average in February **1**.

In March and April, the stock's volume dried up as it formed a bottom **2**. The stock was finding support in the 93 to 96 price area, and volume was fading.

This subtle action suggested that the institutions were no longer interested in dumping shares. The stock broke out in May and advanced 61% in nine weeks **3**.

A stock chart never lies.Sometimes, however, the chart will mumble. Catching the chart's drift can be difficult under those circumstances. That's why the investor needs every chart-reading tool available.

One key tool for stock chart analysis is the 10-week moving average line. As the individual investor studies a chart, he or she should ask these questions:

**1.** Are most of the weekly closes within the base above or below the 10-week line?

**2.** Are the closes high in the week's range or low in the range?

**3.** Are the weekly closes below and above the line coming in slow volume or fast volume?

Weekly closes in fast volume are especially relevant as the stock builds the right side of the base. Brisk selling on the left side of the pattern — when the stock is clearly in a downtrend — is understandable. However, the action on the right side should show solid evidence of buying.

If the right side shows continued strong selling and can't close above its 10-week line, the investor should probably back away from the stock.

**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) provided two different chart examples in 2010-11. In the summer of 2010, Chipotle formed a cup-with-handle base **(1)**. The pattern evolved over 10 weeks.

The left side of the base had three weekly closes under the 10-week moving average and one above the line. All came in quiet volume, lessening the sting.

On the right side, five of the six weeks were closes above the 10-week line. The one close under the line came in soft trade as the stock sketched a handle. Overall, this was good action.

Chipotle broke out Sept. 1, 2010, in strong volume. Also, Sept. 1 was a Nasdaq follow-through day, signaling that the market was in a confirmed uptrend.

The stock gained 70% in three months, then began a new consolidation.

Chipotle's new pattern also lasted 10 weeks **(2)**. Five weekly closes were below the 10-week line.

Two weeks on the right side closed above the 10-week line. In both cases, however, volume was only average. (The three other closes above the line occurred on the left side as the stock headed mostly south.)

This was one to back away from.

When Chipotle broke out on Feb. 11, 2011, the market was in an uptrend. But it made no difference for Chipotle. The stock rolled over and triggered the 8% sell rule Feb. 23 **(3)**. It took a new base to set the path back upward.

The 10-week line wasn't the only negative signal. During its consolidation, the stock was falling as the S&P 500 advanced.

An investor shouldn't buy a stock that's showing a sagging [relative strength line](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/722360-when-the-market-is-down-look-for-stocks-that-rise.htm) (please see it on charts at Investors.com). And that's another thing to watch for: When one chart-reading tool is signaling caution, other tools often are doing the same.

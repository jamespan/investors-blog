Do you like reading mystery stories? Put your sleuthing skills to good use when you examine the heart and guts of a base pattern.

Astute IBD readers check if a cup-with-handle base passes these tests: 1) minimum seven weeks long; 2) no deeper than 33% to 35% in almost all cases; 3) in general, smooth price action on the left and right side of the base.

At this point, though, no one knows yet if the base is completely sound. One should investigate for further evidence of institutional accumulation — vital for a successful breakout to new highs.

To solve this puzzle, count the number of weeks in which the stock rises in above-average trade and compare that to down weeks in heavy volume. If these up weeks exceed down weeks, the base is likely solid.

Look also for this characteristic: If a stock is down for the week in heavy turnover but finishes well within the upper 60% of the weekly range, it could count as a week of accumulation. This applies to the base's left side only.

This action suggests that some large funds or banks put cash to work with conviction and are favoring the stock. When buyers eventually smother sellers, the stock tips higher in price.

Wireless technology giant **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) failed to garner proper accumulation in recent months.

A former wonder stock of 1999, Qualcomm began a correction after hitting a high of 59.84 on March 1. It shaped a four-month cup with handle. We know it failed. Let's take a magnifying glass to see what we can glean from the base's internals.

The base reveals just one up week in above-average trade — the week ended April 29 **1**. The measly 0.3% gain hardly felt like accumulation; instead it seemed to signal weak demand. Among the 11 down weeks within the base, three came in fast turnover. In the week ended March 11, Qualcomm slid 8% **2**.

In the next week, it dropped 4% but closed within the upper 60% of the week's range of 50.10 to 53.60 **3**. This week could count as accumulation. But in the June 17 week, it sank 3.5% and ended near the low **4**. In all, accumulation did not exceed distribution. A late-June breakout in weak trade fizzled; Qualcomm has fallen 22%.

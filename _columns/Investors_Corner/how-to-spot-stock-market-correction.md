  How Can A Stock Investor React Fast To A Correction?

A correction is easy to spot with hindsight. Generally, a correction is the label given when a major index drops at least 10% but less than 20%. A decline of 20% or more earns the "bear market" label. Retreats less than 10% are often referred to as pullbacks.

  

None of these labels is written in stone. They are general descriptions. No one is going to dispute that there can be considerable differences within the labels. A 19% correction has a much different tone from a 10% correction, even though both carry the same label.

  

Likewise, a 9% pullback perhaps has more in common with a 10% correction than it does with a 5% pullback.

  

Rigidity over labels can get the individual investor into a fight with reality.

  

The key is discernment.

  

How does the individual investor spot the correction in sufficient time to get out, or at least lessen exposure, before most of the damage is done? And how does the investor hang tough during a pullback when it isn't clear how much worse things will get?

  

Three things will help the individual investor in ambiguous situations.

  

The first thing is a certain level of flexibility. Avoid getting locked into a rigid outlook. An investor's conviction — on whether he or she is looking at the start of a pullback, correction or bear market — is useless if the conviction isn't based on what the market is doing. And the [market's tone](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) can change fast. If a market timer doesn't change with the market, he or she better be prepared to become a long-term investor.

  

The second thing is the [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/751793-distribution-days-signal-market-top-near.htm) count. Distribution is the investor's most reliable warning.

  

Sometimes people wonder why the term is "distribution" rather than "selling."

  

Consider the word distribution itself. When something is distributed, it is parceled out in pieces. A market undergoing distribution doesn't normally decline all at once or even close to all at once. (The closest to an exception might be 1987, when the market bottomed in 17 sessions.)

  

In most cases, funds exit as quietly as they can. Distribution will build until even bulls have run out of excuses for the market. The individual investor needs to watch distribution carefully and sell into that distribution if his or her positions aren't working.

  

The third item is an awareness of the quality of the distribution.

  

In "The Successful Investor," IBD founder William J. O'Neil wrote, "The most common mistake I've seen involves a number of more tightly contained days where the index price spread from the high to the low of the day is very small and the actual amount of price decline from the prior day is also very small. So even though there is a volume increase and the price closes down, the movement is minor."

  

He continued: "If most of your three to five days are like this, the distribution might not be large enough to cause the market to turn down. Normally, however, down days on higher volume will be easy to spot, and the spreads between the high and low price for the day will be average to a little wider than average."

  

Real distribution is like a punch in the nose. The other is like a poke in the back.

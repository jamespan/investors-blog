The majority often rules, but it doesn't mean the crowd is always right. So, those who track investor psychology and watch for extreme readings have an edge in spotting key market turns.




It's especially true in the stock market where excessively bearish sentiment has been seen at market bottoms, while overly bullish sentiment has been seen at market tops. When sentiment reaches extreme levels, it can be used as a contrarian indicator about the [stock market's general direction](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).


Why? The crowd is usually wrong on Wall Street at market extremes.


Investor's Intelligence has been doing a weekly survey of newsletter writers for years. IBD has found that this sentiment indicator is more helpful to use around market bottoms, but it's always important to keep track of bullish and bearish sentiment. When it's leaning hard one way or the other, the market is often close to an inflection point.


How To Track Bullishness Vs. Bearishness
----------------------------------------


In mid-February of 2016, the percentage of bearish newsletter writers was at 39.8%, the highest level in months. But that was right around the time the Nasdaq hit a low of 4209 and rallied 18% in just over two months.


In early September 2010, bearish sentiment jumped to 37.7%, up sharply from 18.7% in early May. But that was right around the time the Nasdaq composite staged a [powerful follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) on the fourth day of its rally attempt, rising 3% in higher volume on Sept. 1 that year.


Too Bearish? Good For The Future Market Uptrend
-----------------------------------------------


Go all the way back to the start of the bull market in March 2009, and the bears were out in force. In mid-March, the percentage of bearish newsletter writers was at 47.2%, up from 37.1% two months earlier.


If there's one thing that history has shown, it's that bull markets often begin when they're least expected. Headlines tend to be negative and fear is usually rampant.


And how should investors view the market when sentiment gets excessively bullish? It's not the time to flee to cash, but it's important to know when bullishness is getting excessive, just as it occurred in January of 2017.


![IC-011317-IBD](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IC-011317-IBD-.jpg)At the time, the percentage of bullish newsletter writers was at 58.6%, marking the seventh consecutive reading above 55% (see the accompanying graphic, available in the Making Money section of the IBD Weekly newspaper). According to Investors Intelligence, when bulls are at 55% or above, it's a warning of a trading top; above 60% suggests it's time to get defensive. At one point in the month, the bulls hit 60.2%. The last 60%+ reading was in the summer of 2014, a couple of months ahead of an 11% pullback for the Nasdaq.


And who can forget the market top in early 2000 when the tech bubble burst? In late January, the bulls were at 55.9%, up from 39.2% in mid-October.


The Take-Away
-------------


It's important to pay attention to sentiment swings in the market. There's plenty of precedent that shows excessive bearishness at or near market bottoms and bullishness at or near market tops. But the Investor's Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter editors should not be the only tool used to gauge market health. Monitoring the distribution-day count in IBD's [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) and watching the price and volume action in leading growth stocks is also important.

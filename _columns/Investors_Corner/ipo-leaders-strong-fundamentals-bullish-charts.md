In the stock market, [the new and innovative](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735738&sourceid=735749) are preferable to the old and tired. New and innovative firms are in the early stages of business, expanding market share with big earnings and sales growth. Old and tired firms have been around for decades. Many struggle to maintain single-digit growth.

On Tuesday and Thursday, IBD publishes up to 16 [IPO Leaders charts](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm). They're new names on Wall Street, and some show traits seen in stock market winners ahead of big price moves. All came public within the past few years.

Each weekly minichart is filled with vital fundamental information to help you analyze the stock. A brief chart analysis at the bottom of the chart summarizes where the stock is at from a technical perspective. You'll want to know if a stock is extended or still in a buy range.

Don't forget that [IPO bases](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/748391-how-to-identify-ipo-bases.htm) can be shorter than a typical flat base or cup-shaped base. A flat base generally needs at least five weeks; the minimum length of a cup-shaped base should be six weeks, and a cup-with-handle is at least seven. IPO bases can be given a little more leeway. **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) cleared a three-week base soon after its IPO in August 2004.

In the IPO Analysis [column](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm) that accompanies each screen, an IBD markets writer scans the screen looking for actionable names. It's an additional time saver so you don't have go through 16 charts all on your own.

Launched in January 2014, the IPO Leaders screen has featured big market winners in the early stages of their moves. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) has turned into a true market leader.

The security software name went public in July 2012 at 42. It made the screen in June 2014 after it had just cleared a double-bottom pattern with a buy point of 72.60. In the weeks that followed, Palo Alto formed a flat base with an 85.88 buy point. It's ridden its 10-week moving average higher from there for a current gain of more than 150% since its initial breakout in late May 2014.

The company continues to gain market share and has had zero hiccups from an earnings and sales perspective. Naysayers scoff at its triple-digit P-E ratio, but others may argue it's justified because earnings this year are seen rising 93% and 94% in 2016.

Other winners that appeared in the IPO Leaders screen in 2014 include **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)), **WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)) and **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)).

With hundreds of companies forming IBD's biotechnology industry group, investors naturally seek big profits in the ever-dynamic space. And why not? Huge breakouts and five-, tenfold moves by the likes of **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) have become Wall Street lore.




But are there some practical tips to help you consistently make money in the stock market â€” especially in this volatile field of industry? Consider three.


How To Trade Biotech Stocks
---------------------------


Tip No. 1: Try a scattershot approach. Buy a highly liquid exchange traded fund such as the SPDR S&P Biotech ([XBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XBI)) ETF.


Want more juice? ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology ([BIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIB)) seeks to deliver twice the return of the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. One big problem: It can crush your portfolio during steep market downturns. So, be disciplined with timing. Buy only when you see a [follow-through day after a bear market](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) can help in this regard.


Tip No. 2: The best companies deliver the most shareholder value by creating a product that radically changes the face of medicine. Amgen revolutionized patient care in chemotherapy. Celgene addressed tough diseases with its own discoveries. In 2021, we're seeing the fruits of messenger RNA technology leading to the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines.


You don't have to grab shares in huge winners by trying to pick the bottom. Instead, look for companies that form [good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) that signal heavy institutional accumulation.


The Obstacle Of Phase 3 Trials
------------------------------


Tip No. 3? Marc Lichtenfeld, an expert in biotech and income stocks, notes that a lot of Wall Street money moves into companies that issue positive Phase 2 clinical trial data. Such news can spark [big breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and solid price runs over the span of months or a few years. But few companies succeed as well when they get to Phase 3 of a drug trial.


Why Alkermes Crashed
--------------------


With so many people participating in a trial, chances are greater that the experimental treatment shows dangerous side effects. Or it simply does not produce a statistically meaningful positive response.



Consider **Alkermes** ([ALKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALKS)). On April 2, 2018, the stock fell 22% in massive volume **(1)** after the FDA said [more drug trials would be needed to examine a new antidepressant](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/alkermes-plunges-after-fda-refuses-to-review-depression-drug/).


"Evercore analyst Umer Raffat had expected Alkermes would need to run an additional test of the drug ALKS 5461 in major depressive disorder. But he had assumed an ongoing Phase 3 study would be sufficient," IBD wrote.


Alkermes attempted two breakouts from a cup base. Heavy volume on the downside indicated large funds were getting out.


"Especially with small companies, after Phase 2 results, you start to see angel investors start to sell. By the time you get to Phase 3, there's already a lot of optimism," Lichtenfeld, Oxford Club's chief income strategist, told IBD in a phone chat.


He shuns companies with a market value below \$300 million. Small caps in the \$2 billion to \$3 billion range are safer hunting grounds.


With biotech stocks or beauty-related stocks, be ready to admit mistakes fast.

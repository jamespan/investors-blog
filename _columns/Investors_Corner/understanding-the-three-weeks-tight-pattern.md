The art of reading bases and determining proper buy points is all about timing â€” when to buy a stock in a way that maximizes chances of a sizable gain and minimizes risk of being shaken out.

In between bases, follow-on buy points offer similarly advantaged opportunities to add to existing positions that are making money. One important follow-on pattern is the three-weeks-tight configuration.

In this chart pattern, a stock closes at virtually the same level for three consecutive weeks. By the week's end, the share price drops back in line (generally within 1% or so, sometimes up to 1.5%) with the prior week's close.

The pattern signifies that large shareholders are willing to sit patiently with their shares, restricting a stock's supply.

These kinds of tight weekly closes often occur within other trading patterns, such as a cup-with-handle, or pullbacks to a stock's 10-week moving average. In these cases, the tight action is usually not a buy-point-producing affair, but it still reflects constructive stock action.

Buyable three-weeks-tight patterns occur after a stock breaks out from a base or rebounds from support and runs higher.

The price swing between weekly high and low within the pattern can be wide-ranging. But in general, the smaller the intraweek ranges, the better. The buy point appears at the highest mark of the intra-week range within the pattern, plus a dime.

These factors and an added shot of divine intervention were clearly in play with **Generac Holdings** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) in October 2012. The maker of backup and portable generators struggled through a difficult consolidation in the first half of the year.

It started a tighter, more stable cup base in August. It climbed aggressively off the bottom of that base in September, breaking out in heavy trade Oct. 1. The top of that day's range set the buy point for a three-weeks-tight pattern: 26.95 (adjusted for a fractional share split in June 2013).

Weekly ranges narrowed and the next three weekly closes were within 1% **(1)**. Shares began rising on Oct. 23, the day after Hurricane Sandy formed in the Caribbean. Volume doubled as the stock topped the buy point Oct. 25, as it became apparent that Sandy was a superstorm and headed for the U.S. East Coast.

The storm slammed into New York and New Jersey on Monday the 29th, closing the stock market for two days, knocking out power and driving massive demand for supplemental generators. When exchanges reopened on Wednesday, Generac shares rocketed 20% higher **(2)**. By Nov. 5, the stock climbed 45% from the 26.95 follow-on entry.

  Don't Ignore Turnaround Stocks, For They Can Jump Quickly Too

It's not always the latest thing that wins out. Sometimes, it's an old friend.Â In stock investing, that means you shouldn't ignore established companies. IBD's research has found that generally about one out of every four big winners in the stock market is an older firm that's turned itself around.


Perhaps the best-known example in recent years is **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which got its groove back and then some after Steve Jobs returned. But there are plenty of other examples of turnarounds, especially after the recession of 2008-09. Companies saw their earnings and share prices tumble, but then many returned to growth and climbed to new highs.


![IC-081616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IC-081616.jpg)Consider **Tempur-Pedic International** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) (now called Tempur-Sealy), the maker of high-end mattresses that use an innovative foamlike material. Tempur-Pedic endured a slump in earnings and revenue throughout 2008 and 2009. Sales fell 16% and 10% those years. At its March 2009 low, the stock had tumbled as much as 90% from its high of 37.87 in September 2007.


The Lexington, Ky.-based company returned to modest EPS growth in Q1 2009. Then profit declined again in Q2 before rising in Q3. Still, revenue continued to decrease during those three periods.


You might have bought the stock in the week ended Dec. 4, 2009, as it broke out at 23.17 from an early-stage base **(1)**.


But it also would have been prudent to hold off, given that Tempur-Pedic's latest report, for Q3 2009, showed an 11% slide in revenue and just 6% EPS growth. Plus its IBD ratings around that time weren't all outstanding.


Tempur-Pedic sported a middling EPS Rating of 60 out of a best-possible 99, as you would expect given its profit declines. The picture greatly improved for the company's fundamentals after the report for Q4 2009, issued in late January 2010. That showed EPS surging 124%, with sales jumping 29%.


Is one quarter of strong growth enough? Sometimes it is. William J. O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has written that "one quarter of earnings turnaround will sometimes suffice."


You then could have bought the stock as it rebounded off its 10-week moving average in late January and early February of 2010 **(2)**. Don't forget: The first 10-week rebound after a breakout can offer a sound buying opportunity.

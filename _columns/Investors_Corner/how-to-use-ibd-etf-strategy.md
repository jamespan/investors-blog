Figure out the general market's direction, and you've gone a long way toward making the correct stock-investment decisions.

That's because leading stocks tend to follow the main indexes. But determining market direction can be tricky. Topping and bottoming signals require careful study of the major indexes. Sometimes those signals are fuzzy.

Using IBD's ETF Market Strategy, however, investors can decide their degree of market exposure by following a simple scale of market risk based on IBD's current market outlook.

If the market is in a confirmed uptrend, go with full exposure to stocks. When indexes are in a serious correction, the exposure level drops to zero. If the market is under pressure, 50% exposure is the proper level.

Investors participate in this system using exchange traded funds that track major stock indexes, such as the **PowerShares QQQ Trust** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) and **SPDR S&P 500 Trust** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)).

Back-testing this strategy, IBD learned that investors can outperform the broad market over the long run. Although investors can simply use a single ETF to implement this strategy, they can use it to decide how much of their portfolio to risk in stocks.

For example, a portfolio of \$500,000 would be entirely devoted to several top stocks during a confirmed uptrend. But when the market comes under pressure, about \$250,000 would be an appropriate amount for stocks, with the rest in cash.

A 50% risk tolerance may also mean moving away from more speculative stocks, such as new issues or companies with modest sales growth.

Consider taking some profits in this environment.

In a correction, ETF investors should be out of the market entirely. Others may choose to hold one or two outstanding stocks through a normal correction â€” but only if there is a big profit cushion and the stock has not already formed a late-stage base.

When the strategy calls for 100% allocation to stocks, it is a better time to use margin. You can afford to be more patient with some leaders that don't immediately rally.

Each day, the current status of the ETF Market Strategy is published in IBD's ETF tables. It is also updated each day in IBD's [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) product, along with a brief analysis of market conditions. A daily chart of the Nasdaq is annotated with changes and distribution days.

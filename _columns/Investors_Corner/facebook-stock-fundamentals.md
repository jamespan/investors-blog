It's been a rocky road in recent months for shareholders of Facebook stock. And current holders who bought the stock on the way down are hoping it goes back up at some point. Facebook stock has rallied off lows with the S&P 500, but it's still a broken stock after pulling back nearly 44% off its high.

Fourth-quarter earnings, due Wednesday after the close, could provide a catalyst, but plenty of questions remain about Facebook's fundamentals. According to Zack's, Q4 profit is expected to fall 1% to \$2.17 a share, with revenue up 26% to \$16.37 billion. The bulk of the company's revenue comes from mobile ads, which is expected to total \$14.94 billion, according to FactSet.

Privacy concerns continue to weigh on shares as well as worries about slowing user growth and what that means for advertising dollars forward. But member growth in the U.S. and Canada is expected to edge higher to 185.3 million, up from 185 million in Q3.

## Facebook Stock: Institutional Selling

One of the worst situations for an individual investor is watching a loss get bigger in a stock, hoping it goes back up. But if institutional investors have been selling the stock in spades, it's often a long road back.

A [key IBD sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) says to always cut a loss in a stock when it falls 7% to 8% below the purchase. Follow this rule and your portfolio will never suffer a catastrophic loss.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IC1c080218-249x300.jpg)When Facebook cratered nearly 19% on July 26 after reporting Q2 results, it was only a matter of time before value investors asked the question: Is it OK to buy now?

The rationale was that at 175 a share, the valuation was much more attractive than when shares were trading around 218.

Facebook also showed a trailing P-E ratio of 24 at the time. Its forward P-E, using the fiscal 2018 annual earnings estimate, was also 24. It didn't seem like an excessive valuation by any means. Yet it also sold at a premium considering that growth rates were slowing.

## Facebook Stock: Uncertain Fundamentals

Buying a stock "on sale" when fundamentals are cloudy is risky. Today, Facebook stock is trading around 147.50 share, nicely off its intraday of 123.02 hit on Dec. 24.

The market clearly had it wrong with Facebook stock when shares were trading near highs ahead of its Q2 report. The message at the time was that Wall Street was confident the company had put its data-scandal problems behind it and a strong quarter was in store.

But earnings growth decelerated for the second straight quarter. Sales, meanwhile, rose 42% to \$13.23 billion. Impressive growth indeed, but it slowed from a 49% jump in the first quarter. Quarterly after-tax margin shrank to 38.6% from 41.7% in Q1 and 50.3% in Q4.

Facebook also warned of slowing sales in Q3 and Q4, raising fears of continued margin pressure.

Shares gapped up nearly 4% on Oct. 31 when the company reported Q3 results. Investors focused on a big earnings beat and looked past another quarter of decelerating sales growth and more margin pressure. But it didn't take long for sellers to come back into the stock.

## When Institutions Sold Facebook Shares Hard

It's also risky buying a stock amid signs of institutional selling. And there's been a lot of that recently. Fund managers sold Facebook in spades when the former leader gapped below its 200-day moving average on July 26.

Facebook traded 169.8 million shares on that day compared with its average daily volume at the time of nearly 21 million shares. Two straight above-average volume declines after that were additional signs of institutional selling.

Another challenge for Facebook is that from an institutional sponsorship standpoint, the stock is arguably over-owned. The thinking behind over-owned is that a stock tends to make the biggest move in the early stages of its business, when growth fund managers are building new positions.

But there comes a point where institutional ownership gets so large, it gets harder to move the share price. Renewed signs of institutional buying would improve Facebook's technical health, but fund managers could be on the sidelines for a while until earnings visibility improves.

## The Road From Here

Facebook may or may not be a near a bottom. But even if it does start to rally, the megacap tech stock will have a lot of overhead supply issues to contend with on the way back up. Overhead supply is selling pressure that arises from those who bought on the way down at higher prices. When the stock rallies back to the purchase price, they sell to break even on their investment.

The stock has rallied off lows since the S&P 500 confirmed a new uptrend on Jan. 4. Since Dec. 24, the stock is up about 19% compared to a 12% gain for the S&P 500.

Facebook bulls like the fact the stock has been trending above its 50-day moving average ahead of earning, but its 200-day moving average around remains a potential resistance level to watch.

Overall sentiment around stock isn't all that bad, according to [TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/fb/price-target). Based on 42 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Facebook in the last 3 months, the average price target is 181.90 with a high estimate of 22o and a low estimate of 113.

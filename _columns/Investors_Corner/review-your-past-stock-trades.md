  Reviewing Past Trades Reduces Errors, Boosts Returns

All investors make mistakes. But the most successful learn from their errors by regularly reviewing their trades. "When I started investing, I made most of the same mistakes you've probably made. I know how bad habits are formed and how hard it is to break them," William O'Neil, IBD founder and chairman, wrote in "The Successful Investor." "But break them you must, so you can develop new habits based on how the market actually works."

  

Bad habits include regular violations of IBD's [CAN SLIM investing rules](http://education.investors.com/), designed to teach investors when to buy, hold and sell. This is done to help investors maximize returns while minimizing risk.

  

CAN SLIM rules were developed after a painstaking analysis of thousands of winning and losing stocks over decades. It's important to know these rules before you start investing and then go back periodically to examine every trade you've made to make sure you're following them closely.

  

Examples of common mistakes include buying a stock with subpar fundamentals or a sloppy base. Or maybe you succumbed to temptation to buy a stock before it hit its buy point, or long after it had already climbed out of buying range.

  

On the other hand, you may end up selling too soon, missing out on a big winner due to fear and impatience.

  

Violations such as these could have disastrous consequences for your portfolio. Growth stocks can rise fast, but they can also fall quickly.

  

Periodically reviewing your trades against CAN SLIM rules, even once a quarter, will help to prevent you from repeating the same mistakes. The process will impart a sense of humility, which is necessary to become a successful investor.

  

At the same time, don't beat yourself up â€” reviewing your winners to see what you did right is also important. (Please see the [Investor's Corner column](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/750136-how-to-invest-smarter.htm) in Thursday's newspaper.)

  

To review your trades efficiently, create a journal or a spreadsheet listing your buys, adds and sells. Then print out the daily and weekly charts of each stock.

  

Also, for each stock, write down the main reason you bought. If that's hard to do, then you probably haven't done enough research. Hopefully you didn't buy on a hunch or emotion alone, as doing so carries great risk.

  

Next, create a winners pile and a separate losers pile and analyze the charts to see how each stock fared after you bought it. Factors noted should include the weeks of accumulation vs. weeks of distribution. Was the trading wide and loose (a sign of weakness) or tight (support)?

  

It's also important to note when and why you sold the stock. Selling should be done in conjunction with an exit strategy put in place whenever you buy a stock.

  

CAN SLIM rules on identifying sell signals can be used as a guide. These rules include selling when a stock falls 7% to 8% below its buy point, or when it round-trips a gain of more than 10%.

  

Missing a key sell signal may have caused you to lose a profit or rack up a bigger loss than you otherwise would have incurred.

  

The accompanying table, taken from William O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks," lists some of the most common mistakes investors make.

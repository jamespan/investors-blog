A zooming stock generates powerful emotions. But depending on an investor's experience, the emotions can be starkly different.


A stock that rises for months is a thing of joy for rookie investors. Gains pile up; it's tempting to count how much more there will be when it moves up five, 10, 15 points more.


For experienced investors, long-running gains generate fear. Old hands have been in this situation before, and they know how it ends. So when the going gets too good, they will look for sell signals.


One thing to look for — when gains are piling up — is a move above an upper channel line. An upper channel connects three or more highs over a significant time period.


Think of that upper channel line as the irrational exuberance line. When a stock crosses above it decisively, it's time to take profits, or at least watch it closely.


In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD chairman and founder William J. O'Neil wrote, "Studies show that stocks that surge above their properly drawn upper channel lines should be sold."


But there's a catch. The line is easy to draw improperly. If you draw the line wrong, you could get shaken out of a stock prematurely.


Here are a few rules on drawing and reading an upper channel line:


•The stock's run-up must be at least four months old. If it's any shorter, you're not in a situation where this sell signal is reliable.


•Use weekly charts with a logarithmic price scale, such as the ones found on IBD Charts at Investors.com or MarketSmith. Spacing on an arithmetic chart is equal whether the stock is rising from 10 to 20 (a 100% gain) or 100 to 110 (a 10% gain). On a logarithmic chart, spacing is by percentage gain.


If you draw your trend lines on an arithmetic chart, you could get a sell signal based on a percentage gain that wouldn't trigger a sell signal on the logarithmic chart.


•Start the line at the weekly high that occurs near the stock's breakout. Connect three or more highs. •Look for a decisive move above the channel. If a stock edges over and dips back inside the channel, this probably isn't a sell signal.


•Look for other sell signals. If the break above the upper channel line is the only signal you see, you might want to sell part of your position and wait for other sell signals.


•Don't try to use the trend line with indexes. Your best market gauge is the daily price and volume action of the major indexes.


In March 2003, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) cleared a cup base at 25.10, then briefly tested its breakout point before rallying to new highs **1**. But in October 2003, the e-commerce giant broke an upper channel line **2**. It fell 36% in five months **3**.

When **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) broke out in the middle of 2004, it gave investors an opportunity to enter the stock a little earlier than the traditional buy point.

  

The maker of robotic surgical systems had set up in a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 19.20, or 10 cents above the high of the handle. But, unlike most stocks, it also offered an earlier buy point that allowed investors to lessen their downside risk.

  

The stock began forming a cup in March 2004 with a peak of 19.20 on its left side, as seen on a daily chart **(1)**. It fell 21% before building the right side .

  

The handle formed just below the top of the base and began sloping downward in volume that was for the most part quiet, what you want to see **(2)**. The conventional buy point, as previously mentioned, was at 19.20 **(3)**.

  

The earlier entry was established by drawing a trend line from the high of the handle to the peaks in the price bars that followed it. Doing so would have revealed an alternate buy point of 18.80, or 2% below the traditional buy point **(4)**.

  

Intuitive surged past both its early buy point and its traditional buy point on July 8, up 4% in more than four times its average daily turnover **(5)**. From there, it climbed 726% in 19 months, or 742% for those who had bought at the alternate buy point.

  

An early buy point helps to reduce the risk that you'll be kicked out of the stock due to fluctuations soon after the breakout.

  

Intuitive pulled back to its 50-day moving average line at 18 in late July **(6)**, representing a 6% paper loss for those who had bought at the traditional buy point and a 4% loss for those who had bought at the alternate entry.

  

Though such a difference may seem small, it gives the investor a little extra cushion should the stock pull back. That's because IBD-style investors are urged to sell any stock that falls 8% below its buy point to preserve capital and minimize downside risk.

  

Minimizing risk was especially important in the case of Intuitive Surgical. Its breakout came while the Nasdaq was still in a correction. The tech-heavy index didn't follow through until Aug. 18, several weeks after Intuitive's breakout. The Nasdaq rose 2% that day, the fourth day of its rally attempt, in volume that was higher than the previous session.

  

Another advantage of buying at the early buy point is that you can purchase more shares when the stock hits its traditional entry point.

  

As always, make sure the company's fundamentals are strong before buying. On the day of its breakout, Intuitive Surgical had an Accumulation-Distribution Rating of B, pointing to moderate demand for the shares. That rose to A- two days after the breakout.

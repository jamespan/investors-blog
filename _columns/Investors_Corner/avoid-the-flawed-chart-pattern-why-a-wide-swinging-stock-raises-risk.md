If you attend IBD's [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) Masters two-day workshop in December or the [free all-day summits](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=TradingSummit) held throughout the U.S., you'll often hear an instructor discuss the [qualities of a good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) formed by most growth stocks before they rush out to new highs. One of those qualities will almost always be "tightness."




What exactly does this mean?


Tightness refers to a period of a few weeks in which the stock closes virtually unchanged from the prior week. It also means quiet trading throughout an entire week or more. That is, the price swing from the lowest price to the highest price in a week's worth of trading is narrow.


When you see the opposite kind of action take place frequently as a stock forms a base, it's normally best to take a pass on the stock. Why?

CLOSE




Tight closes and quiet trading underline a high level of conviction held by most institutional-class shareholders in the stock. Simply put, banks, hedge funds, pensions, large foreign investors and mutual funds that own the stock are sitting on their shares. In fact, they may be waiting for brief price dips to add to their positions..



Tight price action fulfills the requirement set by the [I in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), IBD's seven-point investment paradigm. The I stands for rising high-quality institutional sponsorship.


A base that frequently shows weeks of wide-and-loose action, however, gives you valuable clues.


What Wild Price Swings By Growth Stocks Mean
--------------------------------------------


First, the big price swings show sharply conflicting views among buyers and sellers. While one trader thinks the stocks is a "bargain," another thinks it's time to bail out. Such uncertainty does not work in the favor of the stock.


Second, wild trading implies that investors are acting more on emotion. The fundamentals of the business, the economy's future or the market's health are perhaps not justifying a solid rally ahead.


Areas of tight action can be spotted throughout a [key base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/). In a cup, for instance, you may see calm price movement on both the left side of the base — when the stock is declining — and the right side. A [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) may show price tightness throughout its five-week period or longer.


How To Determine The Size Of A Weekly Price Swing
-------------------------------------------------


So, how can you tell when the action in a base is wide and loose? One suggestion: Print out the charts of the stocks that lost you money. Study their bases and see if they showed wild weekly action.


Pull up a [weekly chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) on Investors.com or IBD's [MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks). Circle the weeks that show big price ranges.


Calculate the percentage swing for those weeks. Subtract the weekly low from the weekly high, and divide the difference by the weekly low. Multiply by 100 to get a percentage figure.


If the swing exceeds 10% or 15%, consider it loose action. A few such weeks aren't bad, and in fact can be constructive. If a stock sinks fast but finishes the week higher, such action may be a sign of institutional accumulation.


Why This Chinese Stock Failed On Its Breakout
---------------------------------------------


**Fanhua** ([FANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANH)), formerly known as CNinsure, soared 17% in very heavy volume in the week ended March 5, 2010, clearing a long double-bottom base **(1)**. Then it rallied another 11% before forming a new base.

In the week ended May 7, the insurance broker dropped as much as 16% **(2)** during the week of the Flash Crash. The Nasdaq slid as much as 11% that week.However, wild trading continued in Fanhua's stock.


Over the next three weeks, the weekly swings from low to high were 13%, 35% and 14% **(3)**. It was nice to see two weeks of clear accumulation **(4)**, but notice how the overall base [had a flawed V-shape](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/).


The breakout from this 11-week base soon failed **(5)**.


In IBD's June 25, 2010, edition, the Guangzhou, China-based company boasted a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and an 89 for [Relative Strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/). But IBD's research tables ranked the insurance sector at a dismal 21st among 33 sectors.

You're an accomplished tennis player and are angling to defend your club crown this weekend. Fierce competition awaits.

  

Would it make sense to have three stringed rackets instead of two? Of course. It's good to be well prepared. Investing is no different.

  

Whether you've been reading IBD for six months or six years, you know that we recommend the use of two kinds of charts — a daily and a weekly — to help you time your buys and sells.

  

A monthly chart can serve as a third tool to help you maximize gains and reduce profit slippage — especially with big winners.

  

Each type of chart has its pros and cons. A daily lets you study a breakout's price-and-volume action with the highest level of detail. But if you react to every little wiggle that a daily chart shows, you might exit a healthy stock too soon.

  

The weekly chart perhaps is best at showing important reversals in price. Weekly volume is crucial to understanding the status of supply vs. demand. It's also the best chart to use to count bases.

  

A monthly chart has its weaknesses. A new high in low volume or a nasty reversal might be hard to spot. But if you've held a true market leader through a couple of normal corrections, use the monthly chart to track its long-term uptrend.

  

**Research In Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)), one of the pioneers in smartphones, rebounded from a devastating decline during the 2000-02 bear market. It jumped to a 52-week high during a July 31, 2003, breakout (chart adjusted for two stock splits), quadrupled in price and made all-time highs before going into hibernation for 21 months from the end of 2004 **1**.

  

When RIM broke out again in September 2006 **2**, it had chalked up excellent growth (EPS up 238% and 33% the prior two years; sales up 127% and 53%).

  

The monthly chart gives you a clear snapshot of RIM's second **3** and third bases **4** formed from 2006 to 2008. That's not all. The 10,557% gain from its 2002 low of 1.39 to 148.13 signaled that RIM was vulnerable to a big correction.

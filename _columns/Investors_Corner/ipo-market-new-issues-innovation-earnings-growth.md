The IPO market has been a bit sluggish in recent months, but that doesn't mean new issues should be off your radar. Why is it important to focus on newer companies? They tend to be in their earlier stages of growth with plenty of market-share gains ahead.

Some will succeed; others won't. But focusing on top-rated newer issues is sound strategy. Hefty earnings growth drives price performance, and earnings growth tends to be the biggest in the early stages of business.

Out of [33 sectors](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/782568-sectors-are-important-tools.htm) ranked each day by IBD, the banking sector last week showed 13 top-rated firms that had their IPOs within the past 15 years (see a portion of them in the graphic above). Finance was second with 12. Business services were third with 11, followed by software with 8.

You can find this information every day in IBD's stock tables at the beginning of each sector under the subtitle, "IPO within 15 years and EPS & RS 80 or higher." In other words, at a glance, you can spot the top 20% of the market in terms of EPS growth and 12-month price performance.

The [IPO Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm) screen, found every Tuesday and Thursday in IBD, is another way to home in on top-performing new issues.

The Dow Jones industrial average houses megacap names, but it's not exactly a hotbed for innovation. Most of the components are dishing out new products and services, but for these corporate giants it's usually not enough to drive big earnings growth.

Dow component and IBD 50 firm **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) is an exception. New products continue to flow from the company, even with a market capitalization north of \$100 billion. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is another exception, although Wall Street still doesn't have clarity on what is its next new product that will drive big profit growth ahead.

In 2011-12, shares of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) lost 83% of their value on a price hike and subscriber growth concerns. Yet the Los Gatos, Calif., firm, a 2002 IPO, was in the process of reinventing itself, shifting its focus to streaming content over the Internet from mailing DVDs.

Adapting to new industry conditions paid off in spades. After hitting a split-adjusted low of 7.55 in the second half of 2012, Netflix shares are up 1,561%.

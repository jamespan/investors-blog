Latching on to an IPO when it's breaking out of an early-stage base can often be a lucrative endeavor, especially in the early stages of a new bull market. In the later stages of a bull market, it's a little tougher.


When Google (now known as **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))) cleared an IPO base in mid-September 2004, it was an easy stock to hold. Post-breakout, it never came close to the buy point and went on to a huge gain. The same with **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), which never looked back after clearing an IPO base in August 2006.


For growth investors, fishing in the new-issue pond is smart strategy, especially when it comes to firms with innovative products and services with bright growth prospects. These are the types of stocks that can deliver explosive gains. And a solid market uptrend always helps, but sometimes the market doesn't cooperate.


Some gains from IPO bases can be eye-popping. Other times, gains are more subdued. Knowing when to sell is critical.


One IBD rule says that if a gain from a base breakout hits 20% within three weeks or less, the stock should be held eight weeks. The eight-week hold rule also applies to [IPOs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-catch-an-ipo-winner-by-sitting-tight/), but such a big gain is not necessary to trigger the rule. Whether it's a high-flying stock or a new issue with potential, the eight-week hold rule is there to help you stay patient with a potential big market leader.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) didn't suffer from lack of exposure when it came public in September 2014. And why not? A company with big earnings and sales growth smack dab in the middle of a booming China e-commerce market? Investors saw dollar signs in spades. It ended up raising \$25 billion, the most ever for an IPO. A breakout from an IPO base with a 99.80 buy point yielded a solid gain in short order.


When an IPO shows resilience and is up at least 5% to 10% after the first few weeks of the breakout, try to hold it for eight weeks. If the stock behaves itself over that time, you can decide to hold or sell part or all of the position at the end of the eighth week.


In Alibaba's case, the eight-week hold rule would have been tough to follow. After rising 20% to a high of 120, the stock drifted lower and paid a visit to its 10-week moving average. It found support during the week ended Dec. 19, but then it fell for the next two weeks, putting the rally in doubt. With eight weeks passed since the initial breakout, one could have exited the stock at that time or at least sold half the position. If an IPO sputters, the main thing is not to let a decent profit cycle into a loss.


When **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) went public in December 2011, it didn't take long for the stock to clear an IPO base in January 2012. Kors posted four straight weekly price gains after the breakout week. After eight weeks, the gain from a 27.68 buy point hit 83%. It was decision time for those following the eight-week hold rule. Taking at least partial profits turned out to be the right move, as Kors was just on the cusp of a new base-building period.

Holding through a stock's significant decline that could lead to a new potential base is a challenging prospect. Who wants to sit through a potential 15% or 20% drawdown for an indeterminate period of time with virtually nothing but a belief that the stock will head higher? Yet that is one way to make long-term outstanding gains with true leaders in a healthy stock market.




Let's take a look at **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), which had a big move from its first-stage base in late April 2017 until its sell-off in the first two weeks of February this year.


The stock moved sharply above its first buy point — a shallow six-month [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 43.90 entry — on April 24, 2017, just days ahead of the company's quarterly results. A strong first-quarter report sent the stock soaring more than 6% on April 27; volume surged 459% above its 50-day average.


At least four aspects factor into a decision to hold a stock long-term.


Always Check This
-----------------


First and foremost is the stock's fundamental story. PayPal has [become a household name](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-big-stock-market-leaders-look-no-further-than-everyday-life/); users "venmo" each other money. Venmo is a digital wallet that allows you to send money to friends or make purchases and has become one of PayPal's strongest-growing services.

PayPal has recently posted five quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. Accelerating growth means that earnings showed a larger percentage gain in the latest quarter than in the prior quarter. At least two quarters of accelerating earnings growth is a bullish fundamental metric shared by many of the stock market's big winners. [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-paypal-holdings-inc-pypl.aspx) shows the number of quarters of accelerating EPS growth for every stock.


Third, a nice profit cushion is a requisite for holding a stock. A flat base can correct up to 15% and still be proper. Meanwhile, the math off the top can be brutal. A 15% decline erases an almost 18% profit, so starting off with a greater than 20% gain is a solid idea.


Finally, patience is the last necessary quality, and only when the market is in a solid uptrend. Letting a stock idea bake requires the ability to focus on the macro picture and not the daily price swings from high to low.



Remember, weekly charts — found on IBD and [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) — come first. It's easy to lose your way in the daily volatility of a stock's action, and the weekly chart smooths out that choppiness. A simple longer-term sell rule is the first significant close below the 10-week line (or the 50-day moving average on a daily chart). Leading stocks can go months, even years, without taking out that institutional support level.


The Sell Signal
---------------


Even when PayPal built a 13.6%-deep flat base at the end of 2017, the 10-week line guided the stock higher. The new base featured a 79.48 buy point, 10 cents above the left-side high.


In the week ended Feb. 2 this year, PayPal plunged through its 10-week line, closing down over 10% on the week in volume surging 105% above the 10-week average. It was the stock's first significant close below that level since the start of its move back in April, over nine months ago. On Feb. 6, PayPal fell more than 7% below the latest buy point, triggering a [key loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Driving the stock lower was news that its former parent, **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), would be [ending their relationship](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-earnings-beat-2018-guidance-disappoints-shares-fall/) by switching to a new digital payments provider.


While that seems like a big giveback off the top, even selling at the Feb. 6 session low of 72.25 still captures a gain of at least 64% from the early [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 43.90, while giving the stock room for an ever bigger move to the upside. You have to be willing to sacrifice a portion of your profit for greater potential upside, which underscores the importance of maintaining a lower-cost basis.


When To Have Conviction
-----------------------


It's great to have conviction, but only as long as the stock is going up. Remember, while buying a stock is primarily driven by its fundamentals, selling a stock is most definitively based on the chart. When it starts to trigger classic sell signals, it's time to listen to the stock and lock in hard-fought gains, especially when the [market environment is falling apart](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).


If the market regains its stride and the stock constructively builds a new base, you can always buy the stock back at a new risk-optimal buy point.

Whatever you do in life, it helps when you have passion for it. For Californian Kevin Dai, he is passionate about investing in stocks the CAN SLIM way.


Late last year, the former chip design manager at  **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) decided to pursue his dream of trading stocks full time.


"I really have a passion for using the IBD system to trade stocks, and it really takes lots of time and effort," Dai told IBD. "My portfolio is large enough that I feel that I should do one thing. So I felt like I can afford to do this on a full-time basis."


Investing, of course, is an uncertain venture. But the [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/ibd-university/451606-can-slim.aspx) investment methodology helps investors navigate the madness. With hard work, practice and discipline, following CAN SLIM can lead to financial success.


**Learning An Exit Strategy**


Dai first bought stocks around 1998, during the dot-com era. He dabbled in and out of stocks if he had time, saying, "I think I had limited success back then."


In "How To Make Money In Stocks," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil advises people to not just dabble, but dig in and do some detective work when finding stocks.


Although Dai wasn't yet fully utilizing CAN SLIM, he was able to put to work something he learned in "How To Make Money In Stocks." He read the investment classic in 1999.


"I think it's the best book that I've read," said Dai. "Particularly there was one paragraph that mentioned that you had these stalling days. I believe in March (2000) in the Nasdaq, there was a couple of such stalling days. I cleared my positions and I avoided the 2000 crash just based on that piece of knowledge."


Still, Dai didn't have consistent trading results until 2004. That's when he systematically used IBD knowledge and put in the time.


He's also furthered his CAN SLIM education by attending IBD workshops and [Meetup groups](https://www.investors.com/meetup/?nav=IBDUMeetup). He's a member of the San Jose IBD Meetup group. He sometimes also listens in on the Chicago-Naperville Meetup, which people can view in person or online. "It was (thanks to) the Meetups that I learned to read the newspaper," Dai chuckled.


He admits he wasn't a regular IBD subscriber until he started going to Meetups in 2006. It's now his primary resource for investing decisions. His favorite article in the paper today? O'Neil's "How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities," which appears on Wednesday (today on B5). It analyzes past monster market winners, giving chart-reading insights. He likes [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm), the market charts page (today on B4), Stocks On The Move and the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?start=ibd).


**How To Save Time**


Dai, who is featured in Amy Smith's new book "How To Make Money In Stocks Success Stories," uses MarketSmith because the technical and fundamentals are all there. "It really saves you a lot of time," he said. He uses Leaderboard and eIBD.


Everyone trades differently. Dai says that he has a style of capturing up moves and down moves. He makes a high number of trades. "I think I do 1,000 or more trades a year," he said.


Dai doesn't hold stocks for the long term. He says that he has trouble holding through the whole run of big winners, which is why he likes O'Neil's column.


Asked what he likes most about investing, "It's like a giant puzzle," Dai said. It's really a challenge on your psychology, your will power and discipline. There's always new things to learn about the market, the economy and yourself."

A thoroughly vetted stock on your watch list is breaking out. You are finding breakouts can be hectic times.

You dig through the news trying to understand what is driving the move. You pyramid into the stock as shares climb through the buying range. You also tend to other stocks in your portfolio.

Then, just after you've set up a full position in the hard-charging stock, the breakout veers sharply lower.

Rather than enjoying a nice cushion to keep you from being shaken out of the stock, you are trapped in a purgatory, with a part of your position underwater, and waiting to see what the stock does next.

You'd love to see it reverse again, pick up the breakout baton again and sprint higher. Other than that, the next best scenario can go a couple different ways.

One, maybe the stock spends a lethargic day or two, tests your patience, then begins to move higher. Or two, the stock falls below your tolerance levels, and you sell.

While waiting for it to choose a path, investors should be clear on where the market stands. In an uptrend under pressure or market in correction (follow this via the Big Picture column, today on B3), you'll want to have your tolerances pulled in tight. This means selling at a 2% to 3% loss, if not before, rather than at the 7% to 8% allowance for healthy markets.

Be sure to scan both the daily and weekly charts for the stock. They can reveal different nuances. Is volume coming in as the stock retakes ground, suggesting some institutional support? Are shares rising in light trade and seeing volume on the downticks, a sign of institutional selling?

Also, review the other stocks in the industry group. Are there peer stocks breaking out without reservation? Is it possible that your stock is a follower, not a leader? If so, it might be a good idea to exit and look for a top dog stock in the group.

Know the status of the stock's industry group: Is it rising, holding steady or falling? Weakness in the industry can be telling, and is a good reason for backing out of a stalled breakout.

Breakout reversals regularly correct themselves and preface winning runs. But that can occur in a multitude of ways.

**Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) reversed back below a cup-base buy point of 36.59 in early July 2010. It undercut the buy point by 13%, triggering the automatic sell rule. Savvy investors would have opted out, noting that the market had just slipped into correction status. They also would have kept the stock close on their watch lists. When the market followed through into a new uptrend, and Under Armour retook its buy point in September. It rose 116% in nine months.

More recently, **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)) snapped past two buy points in heavy volume on June 9. It was possible to read the base either as a double-bottom with a 25.41 buy point, or a cup base with a 26.68 pivot.

On June 23, the China-based chain of after-school tutoring centers made a sharp dive **(1)**. It undercut the 26.68 cup buy point by 5% and briefly sliced below the 25.41 entry. But TAL reversed to end the session up 2% and at the top of the day's trading range. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. TAL was the clear industry leader.

The stock resumed its run. It's now up 36% from the 25.41 entry.

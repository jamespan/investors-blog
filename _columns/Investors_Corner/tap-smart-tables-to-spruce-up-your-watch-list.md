Now that the new and improved Investors.com is in its second month, perhaps it's a good time for a refresher course on how to use it to find prime stock candidates.


This column will focus on the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables, which you can find under the [IBD Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). From the home page, hover your mouse over the Stock Lists tab, then select "IBD Data Tables" from the resulting list.


The Smart Tables, the first item on the list, reflect data from the previous trading day. When you select the item, you'll first get a list of the 33 sectors tracked by IBD. Click on one of the sectors to reveal a treasure trove of data that include the stocks categorized in the sector, along with key ratings such as Composite, Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength, SMR (short for Sales+Profit  Margins+ROE) and Accumulation/Distribution.


You'll also find the prior session's price change, closing price, 52-week high, volume and volume percent change. Certain ratings and performance numbers are colored in blue (these are boldfaced in the weekly print edition): Composite of 98 or better, 52-week high, volume percent change of 50% or more, and stocks up at least 1 point. Stocks that fall 1 point or more are in red (underlined in print issue).


If the sector contains a Sector Leader, the stock will be at the top of the list, along with additional data including quarterly profit and sales growth, pretax margins, return on equity and next earnings report date.


Let's say you click on the internet sector. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is a Sector Leader, so it shows up at the top. What's the light blue highlight for? That's another helpful feature to allow readers to quickly identify top stocks with EPS and RS ratings of 80 or better that have come public within the last 15 years.


When searching for potential candidates for a stock watch list, it's best to stick with those with a minimum EPS and RS rating of 80. That indicates the stock outperforms 80% of all others based on those respective metrics. And, IBD research has found, many of the most-winning stocks in history made their biggest run within the first few years of their initial public offering.


Naturally, there's still much due diligence to be done, including checking the [daily and weekly stock charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), monitoring news and studying other key fundamental criteria. But the Smart Tables are a great starting point, offering users a quick and easy way to find more than a handful of promising stock ideas.

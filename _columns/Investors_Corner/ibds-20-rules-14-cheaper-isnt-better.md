_Fourteenth In A Series_

"The Canadian and Denver markets list many stocks that you can buy for only a few cents a share. I strongly advise that you avoid gambling in such cheap merchandise, because everything sells for what it's worth." So wrote William O'Neil, IBD founder and chairman, in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

Indeed, stocks trading below 10 or 15 per share are cheap. Too cheap. When you get that low, you are likely dealing with unproven or failing companies. Institutional investors recognize this.

O'Neil cites his research into 125 years of stock-market history. His conclusion: Most of the "super winners" broke out from between 30 and 50 per share.

Even now, with the market just starting to wobble after a three-year run, how many high-quality stocks can you name that are trading at 12, let alone 8 or 5? Probably not a single one.

Certainly, some penny stocks go on to do very well. A tiny few become superstars. Some can grow to mediocre companies, and you'd still have done well by paying a buck apiece.

But the odds are against you from the start. The cheap stocks that do well do so because a company that had been teetering on the brink managed to survive. That's heartening for that company, but that's no way to build a portfolio.

And what of those few that become superstars? The market's best stocks — those you want in your portfolio — will offer you many entries at prices well north of 10 or 15 a share. By that time it won't be a crapshoot, but a proven stock of a solid company.

The stocks you should be seeking will show earnings and sales that far outstrip almost all others. The company should be doing something new, pioneering an innovative product or service. These stocks tend not to trade below 10.

Look at the IBD 50 (then called the IBD 100) from May 5, 2003, eight weeks after the Nasdaq's March 17 follow-through day. Looking at the first 50 names, one sees three names in the 18-to-19 price range. Nothing is as low as 15, IBD's general cutoff point.

What was the most expensive stock on that list? **EBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), which at that point was just in the early-to-middle of its storied run.

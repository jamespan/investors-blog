It pays to be optimistic, but too much optimism can lead to complacency. Likewise, when things get too rosy in the stock market, it may be time to lock in profits.


Some signs of excessive optimism can be seen on a chart. For other signs, you'd have to look elsewhere.


In case of stock splits, one may be OK, especially during the early innings of a new bull market. But two, three or more large splits within a year or two can signal a peak is near.


When a company splits its stock, the number of shares outstanding increase while the price of each share decreases.


Consider a firm with 1 million shares outstanding priced at 50 apiece. After a 2-for-1 split, the company will have 2 million shares outstanding, with each share at 25. The company's market value remains the same at \$50 million.


Companies have good intentions when they split their stock. This lowers the price of each share and lets small investors buy more shares. Firms tend to do stock splits once their share price rises to high double-digit territory or higher.


Too many stock splits create a flood of supply, which can weigh on share prices. This is especially key if those underlying stocks have had long, sharp advances near the tail end of a bull market or early in a bear market.


"A stock will often reach a price top around the second or third time it splits," wrote IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


The size of a split can matter too. A 4-for-1 split, for example, is equal to a pair of 2-for-1 splits, while a 3-for-2 split is more reasonable.


Some signs of excessive optimism are not on a stock's chart, and they require a bit more digging.


When a chief executive's smiling face appears on the cover of a magazine, this can signal a top. Former **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) CEO Meg Whitman graced the cover of the Oct. 18, 2004, edition of Fortune. The stock had already broken out in October 2002 and risen 220%. EBay topped at the end of 2004 and tumbled 48% in the next four months.


Other times, a stock may be near its peak when the company announces that it's moving into much bigger, shinier headquarters.


**Titanium Metals** ([TIE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIE)) cleared a cup base in the week ended July 30, 2004. **1** The stock pulled back soon after, but popped again in late August after the company announced a 5-for-1 stock split. **2** Shares more than tripled by early September 2005.


Over the next eight months, the company announced three 2-for-1 splits. **3** That marked its fourth split in less than two years. Titanium topped and fell 51% from its peak in just two months **4** soon after the stock's fourth split.

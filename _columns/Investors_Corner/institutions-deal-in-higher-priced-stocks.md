  Higher-Priced Issues Can Move Even Higher

High prices can stop people from buying some merchandise, but don't let that deter you in the stock market.

  

Instead of backing away from stocks once they get to \$100 a share or more, embrace them. Just because a stock gets into triple-digit territory doesn't mean the party is over. Many times, a high-price stock can still lead to big gains.

  

If anything, stocks priced at \$100 or more tend to be of institutional grade â€” mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors prefer them.

  

These professional investors account for most of the activity in the stock market. Armed with millions of dollars, they have the firepower to significantly move stocks as they accumulate shares for their portfolios.

  

Higher-quality merchandise will almost always sell at higher prices, in all types of business. There's a reason why a can of Spam costs \$2.50 while a pound of New York strip steak goes for \$30.

  

Often, higher-priced stocks have a strong track record of quarterly and annual earnings and sales growth. They usually have solid return on equity and high profit margins. These companies tend to have a market-dominating product or service.

  

Many investors are taught to buy low and sell high, but in reality, investors should aim to buy high and sell higher.

  

And before you choose a lower-priced, lower-quality stock, remember this: "What seems too high in price and risky to the majority usually goes higher eventually, and what seems low and cheap usually goes lower," wrote IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil in his book, "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

Each year, a number of the market's best-performing stocks are those traded at \$100 a share or even well above.

  

Internet search kingpin **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) cleared a 113.58 entry in an IPO base Sept. 15, 2004. It surged 78% by early November before settling into another base.

  

Google eventually rose to over 700 a share by late 2007. That marked a gain of almost 560% from its initial breakout.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) crossed a 146.50 flat-base buy point July 15, 2009, about four months after the market bottom. The stock doubled by September 2010. Apple traded as high as 644 in April before pulling back.

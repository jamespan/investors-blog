When you start investing in stocks, the financials usually are pretty straightforward. Key metrics such as earnings and sales are easily found, and many websites crunch the numbers for you.


But when it comes to charts, it's a whole different (and challenging) ballgame.


Perhaps nothing vexes beginner investors more than price-and-volume charts. Those crowded bars going every which way make for a confusing picture. Yet, chart reading is an essential part of investing. Without it, it's nearly impossible to know when it's the right time to buy or sell.


Once you break it down in pieces, chart reading is not so daunting. For the intimidated investor, here's a four-step plan to get your arms around charts.


1. Every successful chart has the same profile: Prices make a solid advance, then pause for at least several weeks or months, then resume the ascent and make new highs.


So, you look for charts that already have some success, and watch for those recovering from normal price consolidations. When they start getting close to new highs, that's when you need to pay close attention.


Weed out the less desirable consolidations (or bases) by watching for two key traits: Price declines should be less than 33%-35% from the base's intraday high to low in most cases, and most bases need to be at least seven weeks long. Remember these few points, and you'll identify the better patterns.


2. Prefer the smooth and orderly to the wild and loose. Calm price activity generally is a plus, reflecting conviction among institutional investors.


A choppy chart tells you there's indecision or doubt about the stock, as buyers and sellers frequently shift course. Wide and loose price action also shows a stock in which small investors could be dominating the day-to-day trading, leaving it vulnerable to whipsaws.


3. Just two indicators do a great job of telling you if there's institutional buying in the stock. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating, available for nearly every stock in [IBD's free tool Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), captures waves of buying and selling. A good chart should have a rating of C+ or higher. The 50-day up/down volume ratio does a similar job. It should be above 1.0.


4. Education does help you get better. Sooner or later, you need to learn from experienced chart readers.


At Investors.com, check the [free course on chart reading](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786) at the IBD University. This primer covers all the essential elements and should leave you with enough information to make your initial chart analyses.


For additional education, IBD offers its [Chart School Home Study Program](http://shop.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/chart-school/?src=APA1BQ8). It's not free, but here you'll get the most comprehensive teaching on charts. Other IBD courses, including Level 2, provide chart education as well.

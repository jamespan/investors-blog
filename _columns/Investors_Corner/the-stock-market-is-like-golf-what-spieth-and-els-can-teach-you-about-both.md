Even if you haven't watched or played golf before, you can gain invaluable lessons from the cruel game for your future investing success.


Golf is equally, if not more, a mental game as it is a game ofÂ flexibility, keen vision and precision technique. So too is the stock market.


In golf, you make each shot alone. Sometimes, you're in a psychological battle with your inner ego. The market is no different.


Last week's 80th Masters championship at Augusta National delivered another chapter of wacky, tragic, tense and wonderful moments. Some of them may serve as genuine lessons to help you become a better stock trader or long-term investor.


**Lesson 1:** Ernie Els, South Africa


This winner of four majors (including two British Opens and two U.S. Opens) has been profiled twice in IBD's "Leaders & Success" [column](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/golfer-ernie-els-seeks-a-second-british-title/). Yet as the Daily Telegraph quipped, Els' tournament virtually ended on the first hole Thursday. What happened? On the par-4 hole, Els made the green in three shots. Then he needed six -- no typo -- putts to get the ball in the hole, most of those putts from less than 3 feet.


Els was careless in some of those putts, including the fifth putt in which he tried to one-hand it using the back of the putter.


Lesson? Do sweat the small stuff. Keep your mistakes in every investment small and as few as possible. At Augusta, every green is slick and treacherous. The stock market can act just like that.


**Lesson 2:** Jordan Spieth, U.S.


The new American phenom scorched the front nine in Sunday's final round with four birdies in a row. He stood on the 10th tee with a five-shot lead over the field. It surely looked like the 22-year-old Texan would join Tiger Woods, Nick Faldo and Jack Nicklaus as the only men to win back-to-back Masters titles.


What happened next was unscripted tragedy.


Spieth made more strokes than he should have on holes No. 10 and 11, cutting his lead to a still-solid three strokes. Then came No. 12, part of "Amen Corner" and arguably the most difficult hole at the Masters. The short par-3 hole has a long, skinny green from left to right, guarded by bunkers in front and back. Golfers who hit short of the slightly elevated green almost always see their ball roll into Rae's Creek.


Spieth hit his tee shot short; it rolled into the creek. His second "fat" shot also landed in the drink. A third swing, a sand bunker shot and one putt later, and Spieth's lead was gone. Surging Englishman Danny Willett eventually won by two strokes. "I didn't take that extra deep breath and really focus on my line on (hole No.) 12," Spieth said later, according to [Masters.com](http://www.masters.com/en_US/news/articles/2016-04-10/after_leading_from_the_start_spieth_stumbles.html). "Instead, I went up, and I just put a quick swing on it."


Lesson: If you are dead wrong at key market junctures, it will hurt. If you are not extra-careful, you can lose big profits in lightning speed, especially if you are too heavily in margin or stubborn in your thinking. Pay close attention to the market's direction and respect it. Use the daily [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) and the [weekly version](http://leaderboard.investors.com/thebigpicture/default.aspx) as your guide.


**Lesson 3:** Louis Oosthuizen, South Africa


This British Open champion's hole-in-one on the scenic No. 16 hole was a treat. Spectators knew it was going to be a great shot as his ball struck the center of the green, bouncing toward the flag. Then Oosthuizen's ball collided into the ball of his playing partner J.B. Holmes and rolled into the cup. Has it ever happened before at the Masters? Likely not.


Lesson: Sometimes you need some luck in the market. Hard work and preparation boost your luck.

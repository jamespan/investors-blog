One of the easiest ways to find top growth stocks is to use the Blue Dot screen in [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). This is especially true in a market correction.

This exclusive MarketSurge screen focuses on ideas with market-beating performance. They could be the next big winners amid a new [confirmed uptrend in stocks](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).

First, learn how to use the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). It measures a stock's price performance compared to the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, then the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.

The RS line is the blue line on all [IBD daily and weekly charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) as well as in [MarketSurge](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) charts.

IBD readers should focus on stocks whose RS lines are hitting new highs during a stock's base formation or on the actual breakout. These stocks get institutional support during a weak and strong market environments.

## Rising RS Line + Good Pattern = Top Stocks

The RS Line Blue Dot feature combines the relative strength line with MarketSurge Pattern Recognition. When a stock's RS line hits a new high, while the stock is [forming a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) or [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), then the Blue Dot appears on the MarketSurge weekly or daily chart.

According to [MarketSurge chief Scott St. Clair](https://twitter.com/Zeninthemarkets), "It's the best list during a market correction." He added that it identifies the stocks that are holding up best amid the heavy selling on the major indexes.

## Growth Stocks Had 'Blue Dot'

In the late 2019 stock market rally, several top stocks illustrated market-beating strength, including [hot IPO stock](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/) **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)). On Nov. 13, 2019, shares surged nearly 17% in the heaviest volume since the stock's Sept. 19 debut on the Nasdaq after strong Q3 results.

The IPO stock broke out above two buy points: a [double bottom base-type entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) at 37.97 and a [cup base without a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) and a 41.44 entry. Either way, the chart action defines an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).

Remember, new issues without a proven fundamental track record are extremely volatile.

In [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Datadog stock [scored a](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-datadog-inc-cl-a-ddog.aspx) middling 57 [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).

Keep in mind that brand new IPOs tend to have lower Composite scores. Why? Their EPS Ratings tend to be lower due to the lack of a long record of profits in many cases. Plus, the [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) covers 12 months' of action. At the time, Datadog had traded for less than eight weeks since its initial public offering.

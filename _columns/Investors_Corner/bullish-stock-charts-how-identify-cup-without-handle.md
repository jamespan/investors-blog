The cup without handle pattern can yield perfectly timed entries and opportune profits, if you do your homework. Just don't confuse it with the better-known cup _with_ handle because technical requirements are different.

The [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) gained recognition after IBD founder William O'Neil defined the pattern in his 1988 classic "How to Make Money in Stocks." It's easy for a layman to recognize this formation's familiar cup-shaped price bars and smaller handle.

The cup _without_ handle is a similar bullish stock chart base. Flip through the charts, looking for a sideways pattern to form after a stock [gains 20% or more](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) then comes to a pause. A broad and shallow "U" shape will confirm you're on the right track.

Consider the market psychology that drives pattern development. [Breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) traders watch profits grow until a pullback begins. Demand for shares remains strong but those who bought at lower prices want to get out.

New buyers step in as old buyers leave, yielding a consolidation that holds firmly at or above long-term moving averages and ultimately near prior highs.

![Eli Lilly weekly chart](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IC2c_071822-300x161.jpg)In a classic cup with handle, the stock stalls below the prior high and grinds sideways in a narrow range until the marketplace generates enough buying pressure for a breakout.

There's no secondary consolidation in a cup without handle like there is a cup with handle. Instead, price action rallies toward the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/), and then takes off in a sustained breakout. The buy point is 10 cents above the prior peak.

## Rules For Cup Without Handle

1. Expect at least 40% higher volume on the breakout than the stock's 50-day average. Anything less could signal a failed breakout.
2. The cup shouldn't exhibit declines of more than 33% in a bull market, or 50% in a bear market.
3. The pattern must be at least six weeks in length. (That's one week shorter than a cup with handle).

## Eli Lilly's Cup Without Handle

**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) broke out in January 2021 and rallied to a new high at 218. It reversed on above average volume and entered the first phase of a cup base that bottomed out near 180 in March.

The stock tested that level through April and rallied, completing the rounded look of the cup pattern **(1)**. The uptrend moderated in May and took off in a breakout past a 218.10 buy point June 7, 2021, that posted a 429% volume increase **(2)**.

The stock continued to gain ground, reaching [the 25% profit target](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) in August of 2021.

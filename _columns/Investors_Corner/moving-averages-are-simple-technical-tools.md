Moving average lines are some of the most widely used tools in technical analysis. While price and volume action are the main elements of chart analysis, moving averages should also be in your toolbox.


The 200-day line is one of the more popular moving averages used by retail and professional investors. It can be used for spotting trends and as a sell signal. The line can also act as support or resistance levels.


As a refresher, a moving average shows a stock's average price over a certain period of time.


For example, if you want a 20-day simple moving average, simply add the closing prices of the last 20 sessions and divide by 20. As a stock makes a new close each day, the oldest value in the calculation gets dropped and the newest one is added. That's why it's called a moving-average line.


The 200-day moving average gives you a bigger picture of a stock trend and is useful in identifying longer-term support.


Leading stocks in your hit list should be trading above their 200-day moving averages, even before they break out. A stock's handle should form above its 200-day line.


A break of the 200-day line, especially in high volume, can be a sell signal. But this is often a late signal. By the time a stock goes all the way back below its 200-day line, it would have likely erased a large chunk of gains.


The 200-day moving average can also be used to sell while the going is still good. Investors may want to start locking in profits if a stock surges 70% to 100% above its 200-day moving average. This is best when accompanied by other climax sell signals.


Some stocks, after going on a long run, can also be sold when its 200-day line flattens out or turns down.

Most investors tend to look at daily and weekly stock charts to find bases and buy points. Such charts are also helpful in analyzing a stock's most recent price and volume action.

  

But looking at a monthly chart can also be useful, especially when considering whether to sell a big winner.

  

A monthly chart puts a stock's long-term trend in perspective, which can help reduce anxiety over its daily and weekly fluctuations. In some cases, a monthly chart can prevent investors from selling a strong stock too soon.

  

For example, let's say you have a winning stock that you've held through a couple of mild market corrections. If the stock's weekly chart flashes warning signs, such as an increase in volatility, then check its monthly chart to see if its long-term uptrend remains intact.

  

Furthermore, some stocks don't show all-time highs on their weekly charts. Looking at their all-time peaks on a monthly chart can give you a sense of how a stock acts at its highs. Similarly, it can take a Leaderboard or Big Cap 20 stock a couple months or more to make a round trip, which would trigger a sell rule.

  

Network equipment supplier **Acme Packet** ([APKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APKT)) bounced back from an 87% slide from 2007 through the 2008-09 bear market. It broke out above a 12.35 buy point from a base-on-base pattern in huge volume on Feb. 3, 2010 **(1)**.

  

In April, the stock topped a prior high, 21.97, set in December 2006 (not shown on the accompanying chart), then pulled back to the 10-week line in May **(2)**.

  

While the weekly chart shows a sharp 9% downside reversal in high volume back then, the stock ended in the upper half of its trading range. The monthly chart shows that the rough ride was contained during a month in which Acme Packet rose 12% in strong volume, ending at the top of its trading range, a bullish indicator.

  

The stock also went on to form an ascending base from June to August 2010 with a buy point of 33.68, which it cleared in August in weak volume **(3)**.

  

The pattern forms over a period of nine to 16 weeks and is characterized by a series of three pullbacks to its rising 10-week line and three advances to new highs. The depth of each pullback typically ranges 10% to 20% from the last peak. The buy point is 10 cents above the third peak's high.

  

Those who held on reaped big rewards. After breaking out of the ascending base, Acme Packet rocketed to a peak of 84.50 on April 29, 2011, representing a 584% gain from its Feb. 3 breakout past the 12.35 buy point.

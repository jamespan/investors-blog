One of the most important market turning points in recent years did not actually feature a bullish follow-through day.




Nevertheless, did you catch the U.S. equity market's major inflection point in early November? If yes, great. If no, can you learn something by studying it? For sure.


The past nine months have illustrated that good buying opportunities, in both individual stocks and ETFs, can emerge when the stock market suddenly shows unbridled demand after a mild pullback within a general uptrend. Consider the sell-off that occurred in the end of October. As the daily chart of the Nasdaq composite shows, the major benchmark suffered a nine-day sell-off as tensions over global terrorism, the Federal Reserve's intentions on interest rates, and uncertainty over the U.S. presidential elections grew.


When To Buy Stocks: Analyzing The Nasdaq
----------------------------------------


The nine-day decline **(1)** amounted to a 5% pullback, which isn't deep. Yet it was enough to send the Nasdaq below the 50-day moving average, which itself was flattening out. (*The 50-day moving average computes the average closing price of a stock or index over the 50 most recent trading sessions. A rising line means that the stock or index is in a general uptrend.*)


On Nov. 4, the Nasdaq hit 5034, down 5.8% from its recent high of 5342. The healthy decline kept investors honest, but it was not a serious correction. An intermediate correction is by definition a minimum 10% drop from a high; a bear market, at least 20%.


Only in the latter two situations would you expect to see the market follow through with a big up day in heavier turnover, four days into a new rally attempt or later. But the market got hot on the eve of the Nov. 8 U.S. elections as IBD coverage noted a good chance that Donald Trump would land an upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. The following day on Nov. 9, with Trump's victory confirmed, the Nasdaq bounced sharply off early lows to rise 1.1% and jump back above its 50-day moving average **(2)**. Notice how volume soared to the highest level in months **(3)**. The large charts PDF that is linked to the daily [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) shows the 50-day line (in dotted form) very clearly.


When The Market Turns, So Did Big Emerging Winners
--------------------------------------------------


Although that was Day 3 of a new rally attempt and thus would not normally qualify as a follow-through because it was too soon into the rally, the Nasdaq showed a true change in character. So did the S&P 500. On the same day, [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) noted that the current outlook was upgraded to "Uptrend resumes," which means that the prospects of good breakouts were higher and it's the best time to actively form a watch list and be ready to pounce.



The next few days were bumpy, but stocks continued to roar ahead. Through the end of 2016, the Nasdaq rallied just 2.5% from the Nov. 9 close of 5251.


But by August of 2019, that gain has expanded to more than 50%.


Examples of solidÂ winners in the months that followed range from **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) on the big- and megacap end to **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), **Applied Optoelectronics** ([AAOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAOI)) (Jan. 12 breakout; \$1.8 billion market cap), **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **TransUnion** ([TRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRU)) on the small- to midcap end.


Many of these stocks went on to trigger key sell signals, such as [taking profits at 20% to 25% past the buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/).

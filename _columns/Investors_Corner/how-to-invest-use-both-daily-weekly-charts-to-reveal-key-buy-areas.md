To identify a good stock, look for superior fundamentals. To identify its buy point, look at its chart. Actually, it helps to look at not simply one chart, but three â€” daily, weekly and monthly. Each has a different purpose.


Daily and weekly charts are generally best in helping to identify buy points and sell signals.


For big winners, the monthly chart can help you put a stock's run into perspective and maximize gains.


The daily chart zeros in on the stock's immediate movement. It's a good place to observe price and volume action as a stock passes its buy point. If volume on the day of a stock's breakout is less than 40% above normal, it may not be a good time to buy. Best to wait to see if volume picks up in subsequent days.

So it's a good idea to consult the weekly chart, which helps to put the stock's action in a broader perspective.


Weekly charts are usually best at showing the development of a stock's base and in helping to identify a potential buy point. They're also perhaps best at showing whether a new base is in the late stages of a stock's run-up.


Paying attention to a stock's weekly price and volume trends is also key to understanding its health, because they indicate whether institutional investors are buying or selling in force.


Finally, monthly charts are used mainly to track the long-term uptrend of a market leader that has kept chugging along through several corrections. In some cases, it's easy to count bases and spot a clear change in trend. But it can be hard to spot new highs in low volume, bearish reversals and volume trends that show up more readily on a daily or weekly chart.


**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) formed a double-bottom base starting in June 2010 **(1)**. It reached its first bottom in early July, recovered some ground, then hit its second bottom on Aug. 31 **(2)**. Both the daily and weekly charts show it clearly.


The retailer of workout clothing had a buy point of 43.47 using the middle peak of the pattern. But the daily chart shows that breakout came in volume that was slightly below the 40% increase you prefer to see.


So, prudent investors might have chosen to pass on buying the stock. Soon, though, the stock was shaping a five-day handle with a new buy point of 44.97 **(3)**. Volume was much more convincing, more than double its norm.


The daily chart shows the stock cleared the buy point following an upside reversal in heavy volume. It also ended the day near the top of its intraday trading range. These are bullish signs not evident on the weekly chart. The daily chart also shows a healthy shakeout in the handle.

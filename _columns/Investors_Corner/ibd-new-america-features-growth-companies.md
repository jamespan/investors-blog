Imagine you've been carefully studying IBD and perhaps using MarketSmith as well, trying to find the next big stock market winner.

Now imagine you call up a chart and there it is, a stock with high IBD ratings, setting up in a picture-perfect cup-with-handle base. You sit up straight in your chair. Eureka! You know you're going to be very rich.

But you have a nagging question. What does it do? You've never heard of this company, and you're not about to plunk your hard-earned dollars into an investment you don't understand. This is where IBD's New America page comes to the rescue.

**Search what's new**

Each day, the [New America page](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm)Â  profiles a company, selected by IBD editors, that has the characteristics of a growth-stock winner. An IBD writer is assigned to research the company, interviewing management and analysts who follow it. In some cases, writers visit a company's stores to gain insights about its products and services.

The New America articles are designed to illuminate the "N" in CAN SLIM. If the company is growing so fast, why? What does it have that's new? Is it a new product or service? Is it new management, taking the company in a new direction? Is a profitable new market opening up?

Take **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)), the online networking site for working professionals, which went public in May 2011. It was profiled three times on the New America page: April 26, 2012 **(1)**, as well as Jan. 10 **(2)** and Sept. 10 **(3)** this year.

The articles can be found in IBD's [online archives](https://www.investors.com). Use the search box in the upper right corner of IBD's home page, www.investors.com.

New America articles should never be taken as a recommendation, and a stock should not be bought only because the company sounded like a winner. Use proper buy-and-sell rules, including the 8% stop-loss rule.

**Monitor the performance**

New America companies do have a good track record. You can keep track of the New America Index, an index of stocks that have been profiled on the New America page in the past six months. The index is published each day just below IBD's Psychological Market Indicators table, today on page B11.

As of Thursday's IBD, it's up 36.8% so far this year, compared to 24.9% for the S&P 500.

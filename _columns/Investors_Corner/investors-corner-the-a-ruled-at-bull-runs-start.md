On March 12, 2009, the S&P 500 and NYSE composite delivered a follow-through day, confirming a market uptrend was under way.

  

With hindsight, we know this was a great time to buy stocks. But how could an investor have known which stocks were best?

  

IBD research suggests that question isn't as impossible as it might sound. Sure, no one could've predicted exactly which stocks would do best. But sketching a profile of the big winners would've been easy. Research shows that if a stock meets the CAN SLIM standards, it has a much better chance of delivering big gains than a hope-and-a-prayer laggard does.

  

In early 2009, the economy had been battered by a recession. The toughest chore was finding stocks that met the A in CAN SLIM.

  

The A stands for annual earnings growth of at least 25% in each of the past three years. The recession made that difficult. In March 2009, a stock would've needed to show big growth in 2006, 2007 and 2008.

  

Which stocks cleared the hurdle?

  

Actually, there were quite a few. But because a quality stock should be purchased only out of a proper base, an investor had to be patient.

  

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) boosted earnings 313% in 2006, 101% in 2007 and 91% in 2008. An investor, though, had to wait about five months after the March 12, 2009, follow-through day as Baidu continued to base. The China-based online search engine stock formed a gigantic cup-with-handle base **1** and broke out in September 2009 **2**. The stock climbed 306% in 19 months. Other stocks also met the annual test. They included **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), **OpenText** ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)), **American Public Education** ([APEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APEI)), **BMC Software** ([BMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMC)), **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)), **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)).

  

Did all turn into winners? No. That's why an investor should wait for a proper base and a breakout in strong volume.

  

Did the 25% rule screen out any big winners?

  

Well, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) fell just shy of satisfying the A. In 2007, EPS grew 23%. Two pennies more, and the growth would've been 25%. With 148% growth in 2006 and 43% in 2008 sandwiched around that 23%, few investors would've snubbed Netflix over a tiny miss.

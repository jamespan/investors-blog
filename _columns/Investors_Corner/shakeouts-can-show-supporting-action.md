  Why Stock Shakeouts Can Be Scary, Yet Constructive

Unless you're only investing in CDs and Treasury bills, you can count on experiencing some volatility when you have money in the stock market. While there are big winners every year, you can bet on bumpy rides along the way.


When scouting for bases to buy, watch for shakeouts, which are not all bad. Shakeouts can tell you whether there's support for the stock, and they can even make for great buying opportunities.


A shakeout is generally a sharp drop that scares investors into selling shares, hence the name. This could be a wild one-day swing caused by an analyst downgrade or some news from the company. Sometimes shakeouts occur without any headline news. The broader market may simply be selling off.


Shakeouts can come in a number of ways. In a properly formed downward-slanting handle, you might see one day of wild action in heavy turnover. But as long as constructive price-and-volume action returns, one such swift decline isn't a deal killer.


Other times, a shakeout involves a stock breaking below a prior low, which makes investors think that the next down leg has started. But if the stock stages a comeback and closes in the upper half of its range, then that's a strong sign of support. Sometimes, the comeback may take place over the next few days.


Shakeouts can occur at the 50-day moving average (or the 10-week line on a weekly chart). If the stock falls to the line or breaks it, but snaps right back, that action could become a buy setup. This is especially true if the rebound takes place in strong volume.


In a double-bottom pattern, the second low is all about the shakeout. That's why the second low should undercut the first.


Watching your stock break down on the screen can be nerve-wracking. But sometimes, it's best to let the dust settle before taking any action. If you got shaken out, watch for an opportunity to get back in.


On Jan. 30, 1990, **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) broke below its Dec. 28, 1989, low of 47.25 **1** in heavy trade. In the next two days, the biotech lost more ground and undercut its 200-day moving average. But on Feb. 2, the final trading day of the week, the stock rose 9% and closed back above its 200-day line in huge turnover **2**. This action carved out the second low of a double-bottom base.


Amgen cleared the 55.60 buy point a few weeks later. It rallied 37% by early June before testing its 10-week line.

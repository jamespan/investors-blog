Aside from using reliable buy-and-sell rules, a key to profitable investing is post-trade analysis. Even the best investors perform weekly, monthly and yearly post-analysis to learn from their winners as well as their losers. With a new year at hand, this is a good time to study your 2020 trades.




To start, find all the trades you made during 2020 and print up daily and weekly charts for those stocks, using a charting tool like IBD Charts or [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).


As you review each trade, be sure to mark where you bought and sold the stock. Then, ask yourself these questions to see how well you stuck to your strategies.


Investing In Growth Stocks: 2020 Year-End Analysis
--------------------------------------------------


The first question is whether the market was in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/market-timing-when-to-buy-stocks/) when you bought the stock. One of the most fundamental rules is to trade in step with the overall market. According to IBD research, three out of four stocks follow the current stock market trend.

If the overall market is in a correction, investors should hold off on buying stocks. To know where the [market trend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/) is going, check out [IBD's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).


Second, investors should study if they purchased the right stocks. This starts with [company earnings and sales growth](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/c-in-can-slim-and-growth-stocks/).


Growth stocks with the highest chances of success show at least 25% year-over-year earnings and sales increases in their most recent quarters. Accelerating sales and profit growth from quarter to quarter is another mark of distinction. From there, companies should have shown strong margins and return on equity.


Ask yourself if you bought the top one or two stocks in an industry group. If not, start using the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) to find those.


Market Timing And Sell Rules
----------------------------


Third, ask yourself if you bought while the stock was breaking out past a [key buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a [proper base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Did you buy a stock too extended from its buy point? [MarketSmith pattern recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) tools help train you to identify [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) and buy points.


Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, investors should log whether they followed good sell rules for each trade. Make sure you had a logical reason for exiting each trade, and you didn't let your emotions control your decision making.


When studying the year's losers, check if you let a big gain turn into a loss. To avoid this, follow the [round-trip sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/).


The first IBD sell rule is to cut your losses when a stock falls [7%-8% below your purchase price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). You should have followed this rule always in 2020. You should not have ignored major breaks of the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/).


Finally, another theme of your post-analysis should be to see how well you handled your profits. Remember that most profits should be taken when a stock is up [20%-25% from its entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


The main purpose of doing a post-analysis of your trades is to find the flaws in your trading. To achieve that, investors should continue to expand their knowledge.

A common pitfall for new and experienced investors alike is to buy a stock just ahead of its earnings report because it's "acting right." Fundamentals are top-notch, there's a compelling growth story, and the stock is in a bullish setup.




Sometimes, the strategy works. Other times, it can end badly, especially if the stock gaps down on earnings.


Avoid Bad Surprises
-------------------


Buying shares of **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) when it was in a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) ahead of its July 21, 2016, earnings report turned out to be the right call. Shares gapped up on the news. But it didn't work out with the now privately held Mobileye when shares crashed 8% on the day it reported its quarterly results. The company delivered another strong quarter of earnings and sales growth, but news that the company would be ending its relationship with **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) rattled investors.


IBD's options strategy can limit risk around earnings season. The strategy provides a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings, while reducing the risk of a negative reaction to an earnings report. Weekly or monthly options can be used â€” so long as the cost for the option is right.


How Earnings Season Strategy Works
----------------------------------


The options market might sound a bit daunting, but the strategy isn't complicated.


First, look for stocks at or near [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Most will be building bases. After that, look for a slightly out-of-the-money weekly or monthly call option. This means the strike price is just above the underlying stock price. Every strike price comes with a premium, or the cost of the option. Divide the premium by the stock price, and multiply by 100; this gives you the downside risk for the trade in percentage form. Looks for trades with downside risk of 4% or less.


The strategy is detailed every week in the [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) column of the IBD Weekly edition on page B2. Several stocks featured in recent weeks delivered nice options wins.


Early Winners
-------------


One of the early winners was **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), featured in the May 9, 2016, edition of IBD as it got support at the 10-week moving average. When shares were trading around 35.50 on May 12, a slightly out-of-the-money weekly call option with a 36 strike price (May 13 expiration) came with a premium of \$1.27. That offered a trade with 3.6% downside risk.


Shares gapped up May 13 on earnings and closed at 40.98. The option could have been exercised that day at 36. If you didn't want shares, you could have sold the option itself for a nice profit.


Other winners in the spring and summer of 2016 included **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Paychex** ([PAYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYX)), Yum Brands and Domino's.


Earnings option plays aren't always going to work, but they're a lower-risk alternative to buying a stock outright ahead of earnings because risk is predefined.

It's tough not to wonder what you might have left on the table when taking profits in that hot stock. But it's better to speculate after the fact, rather than to risk having all of those gains cycle into a loss.

Of course, investors hope their latest purchase will double, triple or more in price. And some will, but such big winners are often few and far between.

Most stocks will pause to take a breather once they've run up for about 20%. So a prudent rule of thumb is to take profits when you're up 20% to 25% on most of your stocks. Even if you don't sell the entire position, it doesn't hurt to lock in some gains.

You can then use those winnings to open a position in another stock on your watch list. But what if you're convinced the stock you own isn't ready to slow down?

That's why a special hold rule exists. True leaders can sometimes score even bigger gains during a short period. So if a leading stock you own soars 20% or more in less than three weeks from a breakout or a rebound off the 10-week moving average, that warrants holding for eight weeks.

**Avoid Round Tripping**

When the hold period expires, evaluate the stock to decide if you should sell it or hang on to it for even longer.

Whatever you do, don't take what's called a round trip. That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout.

Let's say stock XYZ, which boasts sound fundamentals across the board, breaks out past a 20.10 cup-base buy point in heavy trade and rises as much as 20% to 24.12 over the next month. You know you should lock in some gains, but think the stock may have more legs, so you stay put.

Now XYZ starts to slip. Soon your gain has been whittled down to 18%, then 16% and so forth. But volume has been light, so you keep holding as the stock nears its 50-day moving average. Then it suddenly slices the key support line and falls below the buy point. You've just taken a full round trip â€” and it was anything but relaxing.

**RetailMeNot** ([SALE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SALE)) came public with much fanfare on July 19, 2013, and closed 32% above its 21 offering price the first day. From there it rallied as much as 43% over the next two months before pausing to start its first base.

The stock formed a cup-shape base with a 35% correction, on the deep end, but still within normal range. It broke out past a 39.60 buy point the week ended Feb. 14 in heavy volume **(1)**.

RetailMeNot extended its gains, soaring 23% over the next two weeks **(2)**. That triggered the eight-week hold rule.

On Feb. 28, the stock fell 11% in heavy trade, paring its post-breakout gain to 5%. Even though the hold rule was in place, that was an alarming drop. By March 11, it closed 17 cents below the buy point **(3)**. Had investors not gotten out by then, they would have suffered a round trip.

While the market was in the thick of a bull run, RetailMeNot's fundamentals weren't pristine. Earnings fell 9% and 15% in Q2 and Q3 2013 before rebounding with a 73% gain. Since then, RetailMeNot reported two more quarters of falling profit.

After-tax profit margins also narrowed during most of those quarterly periods.

A diversified stock portfolio might make a lot of sense. But if that's the case, then how does a longer, more diversified set of duties sound?

  

Many portfolio managers talk about diversifying holdings, partly because it requires more work, more trades, more week-to-week management — all points along the investment supply chain where they collect fees.

  

Individual investors are their own bosses. They know that every stock is an added responsibility and that they must trade within their capabilities.

  

So don't spread your portfolio too thin. When you find a big winner, you want it to make a big impact on your future wealth.

  

A first step requires drawing a line on how many stocks you plan to own. The size of your portfolio depends on your own level of engagement. It depends on the amount of time you want to spend monitoring stocks, minding the market and managing the way you deploy your capital.

  

**How Many to Own?**

  

Experienced IBD-style investors might jump into six to eight stocks as a [confirmed market rally](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/681109-basic-follow-through-day-rules.htm?ntt=follow-through) gains steam and grows. In large accounts, it may make sense to have up to 10 or 12 names. For small accounts, two to four stocks would be ideal. The amount of capital you are comfortable placing in stocks amid a market uptrend also helps decide the ultimate number of stocks.

  

You probably want more stocks on your watch list than you actually will buy. Some will break out earlier, others later, some not at all. Make sure you have enough targets to work with. Researching each of them takes time. Active watch-list builders start rallies with more viable targets. Those who get a late start have fewer options and, as a result, may end up holding fewer stocks.

  

A diversified portfolio, the argument goes, means less risk. But when markets turn down, managers often employ the "stay and pray" method. They hold even badly tanking stocks and sort out the mess when the correction ends.

  

Savvy investors limit risk by watching for key sell signals — even as a stock is going up — to nail down gains. They also use the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule and several others. This process requires attention.

  

As a market rally progresses, it is normal to get shaken out of one or more names, and for even well-vetted stocks to lag compared to others in your portfolio. CAN SLIM strategy calls for selling stocks that trigger sell rules and for backing out of lagging stocks and rotating your capital into more upward-bound leaders.

  

Let's say you moved 100% of your cash into six stocks. By selling laggards and rotating your money into better performers, it might mean that, in the first several months of the rally, you sold two and intensified your focus on the remaining four as you watched for follow-on buying opportunities. So as much as 30% or more of your capital might be in transition, moving into higher-performing stocks or in cash waiting to do so.

  

While most breakouts occur near the start of rallies, others are staggered, breaking out as the market uptrend progresses. Selling a laggard to take advantage of such opportunities is standard. Putting a minimum requirement on the size of your position, be it \$5,000 or \$500,000, is a good way to ensure you don't spread yourself too thin in the heat of battle.

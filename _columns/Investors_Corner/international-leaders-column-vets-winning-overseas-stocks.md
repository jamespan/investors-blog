**How To Profit From MAKING MONEY:** [Fourth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/603354/201203061545/how-to-profit-from-ibds-making-money-.aspx)


Individual investors, no matter how intelligent or industrious, work with limited resources.


This is one reason IBD founder William O'Neil counsels investors to keep a concentrated portfolio of leaders. By doing so, they can carefully monitor the stocks they do have, and not spread their research abilities too thin.


Another effective way to overcome limitations is to delegate. [IBD's daily International Leaders column](https://www.investors.com/search/searchresults.aspx?Ntt=International+Leaders) is a smart way to outsource research into the diverse market of up-and-coming overseas stocks.


This feature focuses on companies headquartered outside the U.S., but that are listed on U.S. exchanges and trade as American Depositary Shares (or Receipts).


The column provides detailed information on a company's key products and home markets. It looks into company ownership, gauging whether the company's market capital and liquidity in its home market to some degree help counter-balance what may be a relatively thin float in its U.S. shares.


In some cases, a national government owns the majority of shares in the company. This may limit the stock's liquidity somewhat. Also, government decisions can heavily influence the company's ability to grow profits and revenue.


Alongside the article runs a list of 15 of the Top World Stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges. These are gauged by IBD Composite, EPS and Relative Strength Ratings.


In addition to stocks, the column offers commentary and updates on the most influential overseas markets, including those in China, India and Brazil.


The column also keeps tabs on the leading exchange traded funds that provide investors an alternative route into those markets.


The past year was a tough slog for many overseas stocks. Concerns of a Greek debt default have hung over Europe's markets. That has dragged on markets in both China and Japan, which export heavily to Europe.


China has also been forced to apply the brakes in its own capital markets, as it battles the threat of internal inflation. As a result, some of the focus in recent International Leaders columns has been in assessing the damage control.


The column has also tracked the progress of leaders like Vancouver, British Columbia-based **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), Argentina-based **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) and drug-maker **Shire** ([SHPGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHPGY)), based in Ireland.


The column also pinpointed Brazil-based beverage maker **Companhia de Bebidas das Americas** ([ABV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABV)), also known as AmBev, as a potential leader in late September. **1**


The column reviewed the stock's cup base, pointing out both flaws and strengths. The stock dropped to test support at its 40-week moving average three times before December, then retook 10-week support. It has staged a steady climb to new highs â€” what leaders do.

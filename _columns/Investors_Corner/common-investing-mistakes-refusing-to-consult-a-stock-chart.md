Even with the CAN SLIM style of investing, investors can't just buy stocks of companies with top-notch growth rates, then sit back and let the good times roll.


Investors also have to mind the stock's price-and-volume action. It's a serious mistake to buy and sell without knowing what's happening on a stock chart.


Companies with breakthrough products and services as well as stellar earnings and sales growth rates are the prime targets of growth investors. But that's only a piece of the puzzle. The [CAN SLIM investing method](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) employs both fundamental and technical analysis. The former tells you what to buy, which stocks are leaders in top-performing industry groups.


Technical analysis tells you when to buy. Timing is a key part of successful investing. You can pick the stock with the best growth rates, but your chance for a profitable trade is low if it's the wrong time to buy. Only a sound analysis of the price-and-volume history of the stock can help you accurately gauge the timing of buys and sells.


The technical action of a stock has to do with what's happening on its chart. A stock's trading history shows how the price has acted and how much interest it has drawn on a daily, weekly or monthly time frame. From studying the chart, you can conclude whether action is healthy or not. You'll learn whether the stock is being heavily bought or sold by professionals.


You shouldn't buy from just any spot in the chart. In most cases, investors should look to buy when a stock breaks out of a pattern such as a cup with handle, double bottom, flat base or ascending base.


Investors can also use secondary setups, such as three-weeks-tight patterns and rebounds off 10-week lines, as entry points. (IBD recently unveiled a [home study course](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/advanced-buying-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=APA1BQ8) that focuses on these advanced buy points.)![ICch-CREE-052616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ICch-CREE-052616-1024x610.jpg)


Also, if you look for a sell signal in the fundamentals, you'll likely sell late. Poor stock action on a daily and weekly chart can alert you to sell before the fundamentals can.


In the week ended Sept. 21, 2007, **Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)) cleared a 30.60 buy point from a V-shaped, wide-and-loose base. The breakout failed a couple of weeks later **(1)**. It went on to form an even wider, looser V-shaped pattern over the next few months. This one also failed after early gains **(2)**.


Cree makes LED chips used for lighting purposes. LED lights have huge potential, as they use much less energy than incandescent bulbs and last much longer.

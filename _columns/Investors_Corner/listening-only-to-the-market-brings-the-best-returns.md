[Ninth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/special-report/635805-you-can-time-the-market.aspx)

Ever notice that on days when the market falls, the news is full of gloomy predictions? Or that on up days it's filled with rosy forecasts?

Trading based on the latest piece of news or pundits' prognostications can lead investors down the wrong path. In the worst case, you may end up buying high and selling low.

Remember that stock analysts often have agendas. They may be pressured into promoting a stock their firm is trying to sell. In other cases, analysts can be just plain wrong about a stock.

The way to end your dependence on those who may not have your best interests in mind is by learning how to filter out the noise and react only to what the market — and each individual stock — is saying.

"Many people are too willing to risk their hard-earned money on the basis of what someone else says, rather than taking the time to study, learn and know for sure what they're doing," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

One of IBD's strengths is that it gives investors the knowledge to make their own decisions based on the market's signals. A quick and easy way to gauge the market's status is by looking at [The Big Picture and Market Pulse table](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm).

The Market Pulse will flag one of three key market conditions: "confirmed uptrend," "uptrend under pressure" and "market in correction." These serve as guideposts to help investors decide whether to buy, hold or sell stocks. It also summarizes the day's action and identifies leading stocks moving up and down in strong volume.

The Big Picture expands on and analyzes the day's action based on IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. It deals only in facts and historical precedents, not speculation and prognostication.

Economic data, worries about the fiscal cliff, Middle East tensions and Europe's debt crisis all figure into today's market daily movements. These are all worth paying attention to, but they shouldn't affect your day-to-day investment decisions.

For example, it would have been easy to have sworn off stocks when the market, and the economy, was in a tailspin in late 2008 and early 2009.

But those who had been following IBD's rules would have sold before their losses exceeded 8%. Furthermore, IBD followers would have jumped back into the market when the [Market Pulse showed that the NYSE and S&P 500 followed through on March 13, 2009 a](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/031209-471120-nyse-indexes-follow-through-financials-again-lead.htm)nd leading stocks jumped out of bottoming bases and hit 52-week highs.

The new market uptrend was confirmed just a week after the S&P bottomed at 666.79. Investors who had scoured the IBD 100 (the IBD 50's name then) would have discovered solid leaders despite the gloom that prevailed among the media and many stock analysts at the time.

Learning the IBD system takes time. In addition to The Big Picture, articles in the [New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm), [Internet & Technology](http://news.investors.com/technology.aspx?nav=NewsTechnology) and [Industry Snapshot](http://news.investors.com/business/industry-snapshot.htm) sections help to identify potential winners. But they should be viewed as starting points for further research, not as buy recommendations.

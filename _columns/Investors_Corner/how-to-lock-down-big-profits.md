Wednesday's [column](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/769124-learn-when-to-lock-in-profit.htm) highlighted the soundness of taking profits when they amount to 20% to 25%. But when does it make sense to hold out for a bigger gain?

  

First, holding out should be more the exception than the rule, as many stocks will correct sharply in price after advancing 20% or more out of a base.

  

That said, the factors to consider: Is it an early-stage base? Are you willing to hold the stock through another base-building phase? Is this your best-performing stock?

  

In the early years of a new bull market, it can especially pay to sit tight a little longer in your better positions. In the later years of a bull run, though, the market generally is choppier, and taking profits more quickly is a sound strategy.

  

**Aiming Beyond A 25% Profit**

  

If you decide to hold past the 20% mark, you need a plan to protect profits while giving the stock room to keep growing. In "How to Make Money in Stocks," William O'Neil wrote, "Once your stock is up 15% or more above your purchase price, you can begin to concentrate on the price where or under what rules you will sell it on the way up to nail down your profit."

  

Are you going to lock in a 30% or 40% gain on the way up or wait for the stock to crack the 50-day or 10-week line?

  

Once the stock achieves a 20% gain, you should never allow that position to cycle into a loss. If shares threaten to cross the breakeven point, sell for a small profit.

  

Remember, it's still best to sell most stocks on the way up while they are still acting strong and looking like they can go even higher. If you wait too long for major weakness before you sell, you may be forced to give back a lot of hard-earned gains. Waiting that long also causes larger drawdowns in the portfolio.

  

Be alert for sell signals and signs of technical weakness on the chart. Look for stalling action, [new highs in low volume](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/757945-how-netflix-topped-in-2011.htm) or largest one-day point drops in heavy trade. Most leading stocks will top while fundamentals are still strong.

  

**Starbucks**' ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) chart action this year offers an example of how this pattern can play out. The stock broke out past a 42.20 buy point from a flat base on Jan. 23. Starbucks marched steadily higher, finding support at its 50-day and 10-week moving averages multiple times until reaching a peak on Aug. 5 six and a half months later.

  

The coffee giant reached a 20% gain past the buy point on April 24 1. Investors at this point had the option either to book solid profits and move on, or to try playing the stock for a larger move.

  

By late July, Starbucks started to show signs of technical weakening. On July 24, the stock gapped to a new high but reversed to close near the day's lows 2 (please see a [daily chart](http://research.investors.com/ibd-charts.aspx?cht=pvc&type=daily&symbol=0NDQC)).

  

On Aug. 5, the stock made a new closing high, but volume was light. The next session, shares made their largest one-day point loss since the start of the run. At the close of this day 3, investors could have still locked in a 36% profit.

  

The stock gained 41% from the buy point before correcting. But down moves are often much swifter than the ascent. In just 13 sessions, the stock retraced a gain that took over six months to accumulate.

For nearly three weeks, this space has been dedicated to answering the question: "What makes a great base?" If you're relatively new to IBD, the term base is used a lot. It's an area of price consolidation for a stock. A base forms when a stock takes a breather after a solid run up in price of 30% or more. Bases can be short (five weeks) or several months long.

  

While IBD has identified certain chart patterns that have repeated decade after decade, the process of gauging supply and demand in a stock is a lot more than just recognizing chart patterns. Cup-with-handle patterns, flat bases and double bottoms can reveal solid demand for a stock. In other cases, not so much.

  

Here are some highlights from the latest [Investor's Corner series](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/742937-how-to-buy-stocks.htm):

  

• **Avoid wide-and-loose bases.** The less volatile the price action in a base, the better. Wide-and-loose price action is seen in large intraday swings as opposed to tight, orderly trade. Volatility in a stock is usually an indication of uncertainty.

  

• **Target early-stage bases.** After a lengthy run-up, big market winners ultimately end up forming late-stage bases. By the time a stock forms a third-, fourth- or fifth-stage base, a good argument can be made that the big money already has been made in a stock. So avoid late-stage ones.

  

After a multiyear run, **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) recently cleared a late-stage base. It's still holding above a buy point of 73.08 but the breakout hasn't made much progress. Since the bull market that began in March 2009, the stock is up more than 300%.

  

• **Look for symmetry.** If you're having problems identifying the type of base a stock is forming, it's probably not a valid base. Demand the base to show a nice shape and smooth contours.

  

In an eight-week cup-with-handle pattern, for example, a left side that forms in six weeks and a right side that forms in two weeks will not be a symmetrical base. In the same vein, a flat base that shows wide-and-loose price swings is less desirable than one that shows tight, orderly trading.

  

• **Look for signs of institutional buying.** Bases with the best chances of yielding powerful breakouts show more accumulation than distribution. Accumulation is synonymous with heavy institutional buying. Distribution means institutional selling.

  

On a weekly chart, look for weekly price gains in above-average volume, particularly when the stock is building the right side of a base. If a weekly gain comes in below-average weekly volume but is higher than the prior week, that's still a positive and a sign of at least mild accumulation. Distribution weeks, or weeks down in heavy volume, should be limited in a base.

  

• **Look for a volume dry-up.** It's good to see attention turn away from a stock ahead of a breakout. A volume dry-up is good to see when a flat base forms. It's also ideal when a handle area forms in a cup-with-handle pattern.

  

**Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) was featured in this series last month because it formed a base with good symmetry in the summer of 2013. It also had other aforementioned features going for it. The base showed tight, orderly trade **(1)**, there were subtle signs of institutional buying before the breakout, and volume quieted down as the base was built **(2)**.

While technology stocks led the market to a horrifying decline from 2000 to 2002, they also helped lead the next bull run.

  

After the Internet bubble burst, the Nasdaq collapsed 78% from its March 10, 2000, peak of 5132.50 to an October 2002 low of 1108.40. Highfliers of the late 1990s fell even more.

  

**Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), the golden boy of 1999, dropped 88% from its split-adjusted peak of 200 marked in January 2000. **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), the greatest stock of the 1990s, went from 82 in 2000 to 8.12 in 2002. Dozens of other firms perished in bankruptcy, rendering their stock certificates worthless.

  

It took a lot of time for the market to squeeze out years of speculative excess.

  

A post-9/11 rally in late 2001 lasted all of three months. Only a few sectors participated, such as defense and security. In 2002, the harsh selling resumed. A mini-rally that began in late July fell apart just four weeks later.

  

On Oct. 10 that year, the Nasdaq gained 4.4% in heavy volume **1**. Although this marked Day One of a new rally attempt, few investors were ready to grab stocks.

  

The Investors Intelligence weekly survey showed that just 28% of newsletter editors were bullish.

  

Yet three days later, on Oct. 15, the Nasdaq roared ahead 5% in volume of 2.01 billion shares **2**; this not only exceeded the prior day's thin trading but was also 34% higher than average. Institutional hunger for stocks returned.

  

New tech leaders were born. Over the next few years, **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) and **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) broke out of solid bases and vaulted to new highs. The Internet wasn't dead, but evolving, improving, growing.

  

The market also saw strength in homebuilding, oil exploration, mining, retail and biotech stocks. The wide breadth of market leadership and strong economic recovery helped the market sustain a rally that lasted until late 2007.

  

It also showed the importance of finding new leaders; rarely does a big winner from a past market cycle go on to lead the next leg up. At around 16, Cisco is still languishing 80% below its all-time peak.

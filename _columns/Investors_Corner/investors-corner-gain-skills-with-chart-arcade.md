It's hard to imagine life today without video games. Even on Facebook, it seems the social networking site's role-playing games (you're a farmer or a mob boss, take your pick) are just as popular as finding old friends.

  

There are least two things video games have in common with IBD-style investing. One, you must use your eyes. Two, practice makes, well, good if not perfect.

  

To succeed in growth-stock investing, you must develop chart-reading skills to know when to buy and when to sell. If you're a value player, you might have the luxury of time to sit on a losing position due to your huge conviction.

  

But in the growth-stock arena, all great stocks can rise and fall with terrifying speed and force. So it is absolutely critical to know that a simple price-and-volume chart helps you pinpoint the week, sometimes even the day, that a leader has begun and completed its run.

  

Mastering the visual clues that a chart offers will help make you a master investor.

  

Enter Chart Arcade, a free game available to subscribers of MarketSmith, a sister company of IBD.

  

Do you feel you need more practice in viewing a chart to spot the right time to buy or sell? This program simulates the experience with a collection of authentic leading stocks in past bull runs and their actual trading history.

  

The game is simple. You decide whether or not to hold or sell a stock after viewing price-and-volume action as it moves each day. Daily and weekly charts are used.

  

You'll put yourself in the drama and raw energy of a market in motion.

  

Fair warning: ChartArcade.com can quickly become addictive. Your score, which is a tally of your profits and losses, increases as your portfolio-decision skills do.

  

If your scores are not as high as you had expected, it's a great time to reflect on the question, "why?"

  

Did you buy immediately when a stock burst out of a sound price pattern — such as a cup with handle or a double bottom — or did you wait, expecting a shakeout to occur?

  

Did you recognize a sell signal but decide to sit on your hands? If yes, how long did it take before you finally pressed the sell button? Did hope, greed or the need to feel vindicated come into play with your mind?

  

As you'll see, there are no ratings or fundamental data to pore over as you play the game. That's intended to help you sharpen your chart skills and make sound trading decisions based on the action enfolding — not what you feel or what others think.

  

You can also learn heaps of wisdom by going over your past winning and losing trades. Print out charts, mark your buy and sell points, and examine the chart action. This exercise enables you to objectively see how a stock behaved without the distraction of the market actually in motion.

  

The game — found at Chartarcade.com — also lets you sell short so you can try to make money on a sinking stock. You can even skip charts you're unsure about.

When the stock market delivers a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) and indicates [a new uptrend is underway](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), many individual investors who want to trade growth stocks and make money ironically remain skeptical.

A bullish [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) signal comes after a mostly negative period in the market, so the negative reaction is natural.

The reaction may be natural but, to be blunt, it's not too smart. The investor is heeding the recent _past_ while ignoring a signal that says _present_ conditions have changed.

What is a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/)? It's a bottoming signal that occurs when a major index surges in higher volume than the previous day, and at least four days from an index low.

The prudent investor will make an effort to buy something on a follow-through day. The stock should be highly rated and breaking out in strong volume.

What if there aren't any stocks breaking out on the follow-through? That happens, and it justifies caution.

The most recent follow-through day took place on Aug. 13, as [The Big Picture noted the same day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bulls-get-third-major-buy-signal-this-year-why/).

The Nasdaq composite, which posted a Day 6 follow-through on Aug. 13, finished at 8016 that day. Since then, the tech-heavy index has rallied as much as 10%. Top growth stocks have rallied even more.

## Growth Stocks Do Break Out On A Real Follow-Through Day

What if the stocks breaking out are stocks the investor has never heard of? That too happens, but it only means the investor hasn't been doing his or her homework.

Rallies are often made of stocks that nobody but professional fund managers and devoted IBD readers have heard about.

Here are several stocks that broke out on a follow-through day in recent years and the size of the gains that followed. The condition of the relative strength line, which points to outperformance vs. the S&P 500, is also noted. See the RS line painted in blue in every [daily and weekly chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at Investors.com.

March 1, 2010: SanDisk broke out in volume 89% above average. The RS line was at a 52-week high. The stock  rose 57% in three months. (**Western Digital** ([WDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDC)) acquired SanDisk in May 2016.)

On the same follow-through, **Power Integrations** ([POWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POWI)) broke out in volume 237% above average. The RS line was also at a new high. The stock gained 24% in about six weeks.

Lately, Power Integrations has been forming a new base since peaking near 102 in late July.

## Chipotle Breaks Out On The September 2010 Follow-Through

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IC_cmg_041018-300x160.png)Sept. 1, 2010: **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) broke out of a solid 10-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) that featured a 154.53 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) **(1)**  in 124% faster turnover than usual.

The accompanying weekly chart clearly shows that volume during the breakout week surged vs. the prior week, a sign of superb institutional demand. Notice how turnover was also the highest in six weeks.

The RS line was at a new high. You can see historical relative strength lines and earlier charts via MarketSmith, [IBD's premium stock charting and screening service](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF). Some of the charts go back decades in time.

The stock rose 70% in three months before peaking at 262.77 and dipping beneath its 10-week moving average **(2)**to begin a new base.

Chipotle continues to be a major stock market leader in 2019.

## More Breakout Examples On The Follow-Through Day

June 21, 2011: **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) broke out in volume 61% heavier than usual. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) was at a new high. Lulu advanced 25% in one month.

Lululemon, a leader in premium-priced yoga wear and athletic apparel, is a current member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/).

June 29, 2012: **Anheuser Busch InBev** ([BUD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BUD)) broke out in volume 200% above the 50-day average. The RS line was at a new high. The parent of Budweiser rose 21% in about three months.

July 26, 2012: **Cabela's** ([CAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAB)) retook a lost buy point in volume 271% above average. The RS line was at a new high. Cabela's posted a 41% gain in a little more than two months.

May 14, 2015: **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) broke out in volume 197% quicker than normal. The RS line was at a new high. The stock gained 22% in about two months.

The point here isn't that investors should fill up the portfolio with new buys on the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). Instead, an investor should buy one or two stocks and see if they continue to act well. Avoid the extremes of either jumping in too aggressively or refusing to test the waters at all.

And keep track of the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). It's an important indicator of strength.

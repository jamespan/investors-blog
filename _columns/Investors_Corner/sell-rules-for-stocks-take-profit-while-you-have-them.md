**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

An old Wall Street saw has it that nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Here's a more specific rule for long-term stock investing success: Once your stock has broken out, take most of your profits when they reach 20% to 25%.

  

IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil formulated the rule in the early 1960s, when he noticed that most stocks broke out of well-formed bases, ran up 20% to 25%, then corrected sharply in price. O'Neil learned to sell on the way up.

  

The exception to this sell rule? When a stock runs up 20% or more in one, two or three weeks after breaking out of a sound base. Hold it for at least eight weeks to see if it can be held for a bigger long-term gain. Stocks that get off to a fast start often yield the biggest profits.

  

Here are more reasons to take many gains on the way up:

  

•All of your stocks aren't going to be huge winners. Many, probably most, of the stocks you buy in a bull market are going to be profitable, but won't become among the best winners of the decade. •

 **You will have inevitable losses along the way, which should be cut at no more than 8%. So you can lose twice and win once and still be ahead.****•** Taking a profit feels good. It helps your confidence when you move some cash to the realized capital gains column in your brokerage account.

  

•Money committed to a stock going through a monthslong correction is dead money. That cash could be applied to another stock that's rising and even stronger than the one you just sold.

  

• Once a stock's correction ends, there's no assurance it's going to continue to be a big winner. You may have sat through that correction only to find your choice is a mediocre performer.

  

• You can always buy a stock back if it presents another valid buy point.

  

In 2013, **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 58.21 buy point during the week ended Sept. 16. Over seven weeks, it gained 26%, a good time to take profits **(1)**.

  

It paused to build a six-week flat base with a 73.59 buy point **(2)**. Sands broke out again, but the gain was limited to 12%. The stock pulled back and surrendered all of those gains.

  

A third breakout from a faulty base failed almost instantly. By September 2014, Sands retreated all the way back to its early breakout price of 58.21.

Greed is good, up to a point.


Once a stock climbs 20% to 25% above its buy point, investors should ignore their Gordon Gekko impulse to hold out for even bigger gains and instead take some profits.


That's because most stocks tend to correct — sometimes sharply — after a 20% gain. They often pull back and form new bases with new buy points or retreat to their major support lines.


"Take a few profits when you're up 20%, 25%, 30%," wrote IBD Chairman William J. O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "Compounding three gains like this could give you an overall gain of 100% or more."


Of course, investors who have strong convictions about the stock can try to hang on for even bigger returns. But at some point, even the best stocks crumble.


**TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)) offers a tale of caution. It was on IBD's Leaderboard, a sign that it possessed superior fundamental and technical characteristics. It's part of the highly ranked Leisure-Travel Booking industry group, which includes **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) and China's **Ctrip.com** ([CTRP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRP)).


TripAdvisor gapped up out of a flat base on July 25 in huge volume after a better-than-expected earnings report. At the time, its Composite Rating was 99, its RS a 91. It quickly ran up 25% from the 65.61 buy point.


The powerful rally triggered IBD's eight-week hold rule, which advises investors to hold on to a stock for at least eight weeks if it rises 20% or more from its buy point within three weeks. History has shown that such stocks have the potential to become huge winners.


But one shouldn't ignore signs of weakness, especially if the market starts to flag.


TripAdvisor hit a new high of 82.20 on Aug. 12, showing strength even as the market's uptrend had come under pressure. But warning signs flashed on Aug. 14, **(1)** when the firm said summer travel trends had been weaker than expected. The stock plunged 9% in the biggest volume since the base began forming in late May. It lost an additional 4% the next day in heavy volume, wiping out almost all of the profit from the preceding run-up, as the market fell into a correction.


Investors shouldn't let a decent profit turn into a loss, and TripAdvisor's action was enough to void the eight-week hold rule and compel investors to at least consider selling some of their shares.


After all, investors can always buy it back later under the right conditions.

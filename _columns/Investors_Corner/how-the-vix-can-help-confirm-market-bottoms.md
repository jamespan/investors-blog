  How To Invest: Why The VIX Can Help Confirm A Stock Market Bottom

Understanding mass psychology in the market can give you an edge in identifying key market turns.




Many psychological indicators are available, but they stand secondary in value to price and volume action. In order to know the market's trend (or change in trend), use the psychological gauges to supplement, not substitute, your analysis of the daily action of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and leading stocks. The [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) will help you time market tops and bottoms with excellent accuracy.


The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, highlights intense fear in the market. The VIX is calculated using option prices, both puts and calls, at varying strike prices on the S&P 500.


As investors get fearful, they buy more puts on the S&P 500 to hedge their portfolios, and that drives up the premiums for those options. This leads to a spike in the VIX; it may mean larger moves, either up or down, will show up on the S&P 500 index itself over the next 30 days.


What Happens Near The Stock Market Bottom
-----------------------------------------


When trying to determine a market bottom, these measurable increases in fear gain value as a "contrarian" indicator. The more fearful investors get, the more likely a bottom is near. Why? These investors have likely sold their positions because they fear a further market drop. The VIX confirms when fear levels are sufficiently high to suggest that weaker holders have been shaken out and removed as an obstacle to the market's future rise.


A VIX reading higher than 45 has often been shown to correspond with major market bottoms. During the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX almost hit 90.


The Stock Market Bottom In 2015
-------------------------------


![ICchSnP070116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ICchSnP070116.jpg)The most recent trigger above that level occurred during the August 2015 correction (please see accompanying chart).


At that time, the market was looking at a number of disconcerting factors. Four rate cuts by the People's Bank of China had failed to stimulate their economy; oil was at a 6.5-year low; and the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy appeared it would end in the near future.


On Aug. 24, the VIX hit a high of 53.29, while the S&P 500 plunged 5.3% intraday. It marked the end of the correction.


It wouldn't have been the place to start buying aggressively. Fear can always get worse before it gets better. But it can put you on alert to vigilantly look for price and volume action that suggests a bottom has been reached.


Eventually, the market staged a [successful follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) on Sept. 5 (by the Nasdaq) and again on Oct. 2 (by the S&P 500) the same year.


The VIX can also be used to help identify intermediate corrections. IBD research has found that when the VIX rises to extend more than 20% above its 10-day moving average on an intraday basis, it suggests fear has increased on a short-term basis.

  How To Trade: Decipher Accumulation In A Stock's Base

Like most things bought and sold, stocks obey the laws of supply and demand. Strong demand and tight supply produce a higher price.


A basing stock sends countless quiet signals detailing its supply-demand balance. Learning to read those signals helps determine when institutional investors are moving into or out of a stock. That knowledge is crucial to qualifying a developing base.


XTO Energy began sending clear messages last in May 2002, as it slipped into a cup base. The Houston-based energy producer had shifted its focus from oil to natural gas in the late 1990s. Gas prices spiked 500% in 2001 in tandem with California's energy crisis.


XTO was about to become one of the best-performing stocks of the 2000-08 period.


XTO's weekly chart showed higher volume on price declines during at least two of the weeks in which it descended the left side of the base. A sign of distribution, price declines in higher volume indicate net selling by institutions.


Behavior changed abruptly in the week ended July 26, 2002 **1**. The stock fell, then reversed sharply to end at 17.41, high in the week's trading range, in a surge of volume.


Despite that 3.6% decline for the week, the fact that the stock ended high in the week's trading range in strong trade signaled accumulation. Institutions had stepped in and were buying tons of shares.


XTO rose in above-average trade for the next three weeks â€” signs of more accumulation.


As shares broke above their 40-week moving average, the stock closed at the absolute top of the week's range **2**. This reinforces the message that institutional buyers are at work.


For further support, you can use IBD's proprietary Accumulation/Distribution Rating. This appears in IBD's daily Research Tables and in the mini-charts accompanying IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Your Weekly Review charts. A grade of C+ or better suggests large-volume buying activity.


XTO's grade just before its breakout in October was a B.


Volume began to cool after XTO set up a handle in August **3**. The stock broke out past a 21.09 buy point in massive trade in the first week of October **4**. It climbed more than 900% through its peak in June 2008.

After the bear market of 2008-09 ended, sending the entire market to its knees, some growth stocks stopped kneeling.

Then, after the S&P 500's [follow-through bottoming signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) took hold on March 12, 2009, companies with excellent products, top-drawer management and industry-leading margins came back.

In many cases such stocks won't become [CAN SLIM-quality leaders](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) for years. Yet eventually any sector in the stock market that is bludgeoned this badly will come back.

What should the disciplined investor look for in terms of these stocks' chart action? Look for what IBD founder and longtime chairman William O'Neil likes to call bottoming bases.

## Seek These Factors In A Bottoming Base

First, a bottoming base forms when the market has undergone a cataclysmic bear market. When the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq composite drops 40% to 50% from its highs, expect former growth stock leaders to drop 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times that amount. That's why you'll see some former market darlings fall 60% to 75% from their peaks, even more.

The stock needs ample time to form the right side of a bottoming base. Think months, even years. Why so long? You want confirmation that institutional investors accumulate shares in a big way and eventually tip the scale from one of excess supply (funds are extra-willing to sell their shares) to excess demand (extra-willing to buy at any price).

[The traits of good bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) apply. Look for big up weeks in price in heavy or rising weekly volume. Seek symmetry within the base. If a handle forms, it should slant downward along the handle's price lows and volume should dry up. The base should show tight trading.

## Watch For A 52-Week High

Finally, keep an eagle eye out for a strong breakout to a 52-week high in heavy trade to trigger a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Remember, for a bottoming base to complete, a stock doesn't have to necessarily trade at or near an all-time high.

Know in advance the average volume over the past 50 sessions: get it at the top of any [IBD daily chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), available under the Research tab at Investors.com.

**Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) debuted on the market in November 2005. (Today, Under Armour has two classes of stock; the original shares trades under the ticker symbol, "UAA.") Shares dove 84% from its August 2007 peak during the 2008-2009 market slide. But the fast-growing sports apparel maker offered a stylish, performance-driven alternative to other brands.

[Yogafit founder](http://www.yogafit.com/) Beth Shaw told IBD that UA was unusual in marketing its brand at trade shows for the exercise and health and wellness industries.

The stock bottomed out at 11.94 on March 6, 2009, then rebounded for the rest of the year. Shares climbed more than 20% from an entry in September, but a breakout attempt in October flopped fast.

But UA later formed better-quality bases, including a nearly [six-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 40.10 buy point in August to September 2010 (see the accompanying weekly chart). The base showed light volume in each of the three down weeks.

UA also showed solid ratings at its Sept. 9, 2010, breakout in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), including a 95 Composite Rating, 97 EPS, 93 RS and B+ for Accumulation/Distribution. Just days earlier on Sept. 1, the market followed through. UA doubled in six months before hitting choppy waters during the 2011 market correction.

## Bottoming Base: The Apple Case Study

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has gone up a lot since it formed a bottoming base less than two years ago.

Check out the [11-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) that completed at the end of 2016. The stock broke out of that perfect base on Jan. 6, 2017, at 118.12. Volume was relatively light on the breakout day, but really came in strong a few weeks later on Feb. 1 after the iPhone, iPad, Macbook and digital services innovator reported improved quarterly results.

The gain from that [prime buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) reached 97% in early October this year, when Apple peaked at 233.47.

Today, shares hover near 209, still up more than 76%, and working on a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). It may be forming a [new handle on its deep cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/), ushering a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 221.47.

Earnings season will start sweeping over Wall Street this week, and with each report the focus will be on two numbers: the company's earnings and sales.


That pair dominates investors' attention. After all, they are the most important figures in any quarterly report -- how much was sold and how much profit was made. But investors should also look at the company's cash flow, an often underestimated set of numbers in the earnings report.


In a nutshell, cash flow describes how much cash goes in and out of a business. How much went out in operating costs and how much came in from investments and financing operations are all part of the statement of cash flows.


Despite all the attention they get, earnings and revenue figures are seldom straightforward. A number of factors can skew results, such as the number of days in a quarter or extraordinary expenses. When a manufacturer takes an order for \$10 million in merchandise, it may not get all that until months later, as deliveries are made. Yet it may recognize the entire value of the contract right away.


Cash flow accounts for all changes in cash, in or out, over a reporting period, and that can provide a more transparent look at the condition of a business.


By accounting standards, cash flows are divided into three parts: from operations, investing (such as writing out a check for new vehicles) and financing activities (such as making a bond payment). The most important for investors is the cash flow from operations. It's in that section that a company shows cash generated from its business and cash payments made for day-to-day operations. Some noncash items are part of this section, but it's still the most revealing for investors.


![COR_071816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/COR_071816.jpg)For growth companies, look for cash flow per share at least 20% higher than earnings per share. Historically, that's been a level seen in most winning stocks. So, for example, if XYZ Corp. earned \$3 a share last year, you want the annual cash flow to be at least \$3.60 a share.


You can find the cash flow in the quarterly earnings statements, which usually appear after the income statement and the balance sheet. Operating cash flows usually are the first listed. Don't expect to find cash flow per share. Accountants are not required to give that figure, so you have to do it yourself.


Take the total (in many statements it's called "net cash provided by operating activities") and divide that sum by the number of shares outstanding to get cash flow per share.


Cash flow is not provided in the quotes or Stock Checkup at Investors.com. But in IBD's [MarketSmith charting and research product](http://marketsmith.investors.com/), cash flow per share is available in the fundamentals block in weekly charts.

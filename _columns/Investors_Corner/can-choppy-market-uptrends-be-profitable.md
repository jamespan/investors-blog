A choppy market uptrend is hard to play.

  

U-turns are common. No move is sustained for long. That's been the story for much of this year.

  

Can such uptrends be profitable? Perhaps, but only if investors think "small ball," not "home runs."

  

How do investors know when to play small ball? It's reasonable to expect smaller returns in the third year of a bull market. It's also reasonable to think small when previous uptrends were stingy. (If stocks soar after you take small profits, that's feedback: You turn aggressive.)

  

Smaller profits mean you must cut losses quicker. In a strong uptrend, taking most profits at 20% to 25% and cutting losses at 7% or 8% is prudent; it preserves a 3-to-1 ratio of gains to losses. The 3-1 ratio gives investors a better chance of overall success.

  

**When To Lower Expectations**

  

In a sideways market, few stocks will achieve a 20% gain. You will have to set the targets lower.

  

If you take profits at 15%, then you should cut losses at 3% to 5%. But how well does this work out?

  

Let's look at breakouts during a recent choppy uptrend: from the Aug. 23 follow-through day until IBD noted on Sept. 22 that a correction had begun.

  

IBD screened for a Composite Rating of at least 90; daily volume of at least 400,000; no stocks in laggard industry groups; no fourth-stage bases; and bases had to show accumulation.

  

A footnote should be added here. IBD found that accumulation in the base was especially important. Breakouts from stocks that showed either no accumulation in the base or outright distribution ended badly. Had the investors played stocks with no accumulation in the base, they would've taken far too many 5% losses.

  

Eight stocks made the screen: **Hansen Natural** ([HANS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HANS)), which broke out Aug. 23; **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), Aug. 24; **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), Aug. 29; **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), Aug. 30; **Hi-Tech Pharmacal** ([HITK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HITK)), Sept. 16; **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), Sept. 20; **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), Sept. 20; and **Alexion Pharmaceutical** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)).

  

Each involved a breakout, except perhaps Alexion. The stock could've been seen as a breakout from a six-week cup base with a 59.17 buy point, or as a bounce off the 10-week line.

  

A ninth stock, **Athenahealth** ([ATHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHN)), made good but brief progress in a bounce off the 50-day line.

  

Of these nine stocks, gains varied, but realistically the disciplined investor could've made modest profits on six and would've had to cut losses on three.

  

The three weakest performers — Hi-Tech, Visa and Celgene — technically rose 4% to 7% after their breakouts. But the moves were so brief that investors would've been unlikely to lock in the gains. We'll assume 5% losses in each case.

  

The other six stocks gained as much as 11% to 21%. Let's assume the investor locked in profits at 15%. That meant leaving some money on the table in two of the five cases. In the sixth case (AutoZone), the stock rose only 11%. Given AutoZone's vicious downside reversal on Sept. 29, we'll assume investors sold at the close for a 5% profit.

  

The good news is that investors could've made money with this small-ball approach. The bad news is that the overall gain was 7%.

  

This little exercise underlines one reality: Without a strong market uptrend, making serious money is difficult.

  

A choppy market chops profits.

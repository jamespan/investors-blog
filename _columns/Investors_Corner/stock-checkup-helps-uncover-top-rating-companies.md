If you're old enough to remember the days before computers and the Internet, you will recall that an individual investor might be forced to journey to the public library to read up on the fundamentals of a company that interested him.


Or he might have to subscribe to expensive services that mailed out information a week old that probably didn't cover all the stocks that might be of interest, such as small-cap companies or new issues, or contain all the data he might need to make an informed investment decision.


Today, computer screens and online databases help investors not only see if a company meets his investment criteria. They also zero in on companies that meet his criteria the best and do so right from his desktop, or even his phone or tablet when he's on the go.


In other words, he can beat a quick path to the best companies in the market, some of which may not have been on his radar screen.


IBD's Stock Checkup is just such a tool. Subscribers can access it from Investors.com's just-redesigned website by hovering over the research tab near the top of the home page. [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) is the first entry in the left column.


Punch in a ticker and see various fundamental and technical factors; all are critical to an investment decision. Stock Checkup uses green (strongly passes), yellow (questionable) and red lights (fails) to quickly tell an investor whether the stock meets the [CAN SLIM system's standards](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749).


Here's a way to use Stock Checkup that might be new to you. Once you've found an interesting company in an industry group, it can lead you to even better stocks in the same group. Right at the top of Checkup are the top-rated stocks in the group. You might find stocks with better rankings than the one you were researching.


Let's take a current example. Suppose you've been prospecting through stock charts and came across **Physicians Realty Trust** ([DOC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOC)). It has formed an intriguing base and might break out any day. Earnings and revenue growth have been impressive. Like most REITs, it pays a handsome dividend.

You notice the stock's part of the Finance-Property REIT industry group. Real estate investment trusts have been doing well recently, and the group is highly ranked based on the most recent six-month performance. So punch in the ticker for Physicians Realty into Stock Checkup, and you find that 192 stocks are in the group. They run from the very good to the not so good.


You also notice several others rank higher than Physicians Realty by Composite Rating. This rating is IBD's most comprehensive, stirring together the EPS Rating, Relative Strength Rating and other proprietary ratings of fundamental and technical characteristics.


Other things being equal, investors should buy the No. 1 or No. 2 company in an industry group. Now, you have several new ideas to explore.


Don't buy the No. 1 or No. 2 stock without doing more investigation. Check the chart to see if it's near a  buy point. Check the trading volume to see if it's too thin. Generally, investors should trade stocks with an average daily volume of 400,000.

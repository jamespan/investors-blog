A lot of moving parts go into identifying valid base patterns. The depth and length of the base, the position of the buy point and the accompanying volume characteristics are all critical factors, and all slightly different depending on the type of base.


A common trait -- and one on which investors often feel they can fudge the numbers -- is the uptrend that needs to occur before the base forms.


There are a few good reasons why this factor sometimes confuses even experienced investors.


In his book "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William O'Neil explained that "chart patterns, or 'bases,' are simply areas of price correction or consolidation after an earlier price advance."


It is easy to become focused on the patterns themselves and forget about the prior advance. But the standard rule is a stock needs to rise at least 30% before beginning a base. You would normally use a weekly chart, and look for a run of at least 30% from an intraweek low to the high that marks the left-side start of a cup base, or the first down-week marking the start of a flat base.


To start, this runs against some conventional wisdom. It bumps a lot of "buy low, sell high" disciples -- who see a stock as spent after a 30% run -- out of the picture. But O'Neil and many others profess a buy high, sell higher philosophy that taps into strong companies with powerful fundamental traits: outstanding earnings-per-share growth, the most innovative products in a rising industry, and exploitable markets.


Current leaders such as China's **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Equinix** ([EQIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EQIX)) are just a few examples. All have powered higher in multiyear advances, despite a market that has been inhospitable to growth stocks.


In addition to a rise of at least 30%, an uptrend before a base should also generate improving relative strength and "very substantial increases in trading volume" at some points, O'Neil wrote.


There are a number of ways to check relative strength. The easiest is using the daily and weekly charts (accessible via the [IBD Charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) link under the Research tab on Investors.com) and [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) to provide relative strength lines and ratings.


You want to see a rising RS line (highlighted in IBD charts in blue) during the stock's run-up before a base. This tells you that the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. You can also track bullish volume characteristics using these same IBD features.

This means that from the buy point to the lip of a new base may only be 20% or so. But if you measure from the low of the prior base, the run will more times than not be at or above 30%.


Another confusing factor: base-on-base patterns. These occur when breakouts fizzle, rise only a small amount or fail to materialize, but a stock continues consolidating. In these bases there is no prior uptrend, but there must be an uptrend before the initial base on which the base-on-base forms.

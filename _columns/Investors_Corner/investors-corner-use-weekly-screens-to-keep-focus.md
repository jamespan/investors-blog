*Screening For Winners: Last In A Series*

  

The beauty of a computer-driven stock screen lies in its consistency.

  

The computer doesn't take a week or month off because it simply doesn't feel like searching for outstanding stocks. Without complaints or biases, it simply does the job week in, week out.

  

If you want to own a piece of the greatest stocks during good markets, focus on stocks that are culled from The IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and Big Cap 20.

  

"Why pay attention to screens?" some might ask. "I like to go with my gut," others might argue.

  

Here's why: Through unbiased research of many past bull market cycles, IBD has found that the biggest winners showed superior fundamentals and moved up sharply in price (or in some cases held steady as the market fell to pieces) before they launched huge moves in price.

  

**Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) is a sterling example. In the Aug. 9 edition of the IBD 100 (the predecessor to the IBD 50), IBD noted that the online travel agent had jumped out of a cup with handle with a 234.55 buy point. Before the breakout, Priceline grew its earnings per share by 44%, 54%, 56% and 53%. No surprise, then, that its EPS Rating was a 99. Priceline is up about 75% since Aug. 9.

  

Your Weekly Review appears on Fridays and usually boasts the largest number of stocks for your research. A lot more small caps make this list because the average volume criterion is less strict than for the IBD 50. But this screen is no slouch; only those with EPS and Relative Price Strength ratings of 85 or higher and are trading within 15% of their highs make the cut. So in a sick market, this screen could showcase fewer than 20 stocks.

  

The IBD Big Cap 20 is designed for investors who want to bag solid gains but have no taste for the kind of volatility that a **Travelzoo** ([TZOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TZOO)) or **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) might offer. This screen culls companies with a market cap of at least \$15 billion and show high Composite ratings. Average daily volume must also be substantial. In the May 3 edition, No. 20-ranked **Cummins** ([CMI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMI)) had a 91 Composite, an 86 EPS and an 85 RS. It's shaped a solid uptrend since early 2010.

  

A screen today might not show many stocks that had made big run-ups in prior bull runs. That's okay. New stocks lead new bull markets.

  

In all three features, each chart carries a line of analysis about the stock's most recent price and volume behavior. Use this information to update your watch list and improve the timing of your buy and sell decisions.

  

Always remember that none of these features should be considered buy lists. They are designed to help you save time in research and be prepared for a potential buying opportunity.

A dose of fear can be good for stock investors.

But it's sometimes an emotion to ignore.

Wall Street likes to say that the market climbs a wall of worry.

Indeed, fear can be a productive force in investing.

It helps investors keep their greed in check and moderates their risk exposure.

But too much fear can make investors back away from stocks when there's no need to.

Here's how it can happen:

When a high-quality growth stock hits a new price high, many investors have a tendency to think that shares have gone up too much and that it's risky to buy.

But when the new high occurs just as the stock has cleared a proper base, that's precisely when investors should buy.

This type of movement on a chart tells you that the stock is breaking through levels where sellers showed up in the past, but now strong buyers are emerging, ready to pay higher asking prices.

If the stock is a true leader and clears a consolidation in heavy volume, and if market conditions are right, the stock will keep making more new highs.

The fear of new highs becomes just as unfounded and unproductive as hypochondria.

New highs can be dangerous. But that's only after a prolonged run in which the stock already has cleared a few consolidations.

Another way that fear becomes an unhealthy emotion is when investors guard their profits too much and end up selling prematurely.

The fear of losing a small profit can force investors to sell as soon as their stock gets back near the price at which they bought.

Never mind that there may be no sell signals in this situation. In fact, these pullbacks are more common than you might realize.

Four out of 10 stocks pull back to their buy points after making gains from their breakouts.

So quite probably the stock will bounce back and resume its advance.

How do you keep fear from causing investing missteps?

The same way that you should handle all emotions in your trading — using rules and having the discipline to follow them.

It's impossible to abandon all feelings.

And why not celebrate a successful trade?

Oh, go ahead — dance on the table.

But following a consistent set of rules for buying and selling is the surest way to keep fear in check.

Those rules are too numerous to mention here.

But you can find summaries of them at IBD University, an educational program at Investors.com.

"Charting the Course" in particular helps investors understand how to set clear entries into a stock and how to read the warning signs on charts.

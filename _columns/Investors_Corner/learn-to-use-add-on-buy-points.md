Gas pedal. Brake.


When you first start to drive cars, those are the basics. But experienced drivers develop an intuitive feel for when and how much gas or brake to apply. That intuition ultimately makes their vehicle a less risky, more effective form of transportation.


When you first start to trade in the stock market, the basics are buy and sell. Over time, you evolve into a more nuanced understanding of moving into and out of stocks.


An important step is learning to build positions as you identify, analyze and buy into a winning stock. There are a couple different components to this tactic.


The first is pyramiding, a strategy discussed in detail in Wednesday's [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/665720-pyramiding-into-stocks-reduces-risk.htm?Ntt=pyramid-scott-stoddard-investors) .


The next is to capitalize on follow-on buy opportunities. This is how they work.


Let's say you are in a stock with a full position. The market is ticking its way through an uptrend. You bought into five stocks at the start of the uptrend. Two of those turned lower and triggered sell rules. As a result, you have idle capital in your account.


Among your other stocks, one is lagging, but not yet tripping the sell wire. Two are turning in productive gains and worth holding.


Your goal is to fold a prudent amount of your parked capital into your most productive stocks. You can do this through add-on buy opportunities such as rebounds from 10-week support and three-weeks-tight patterns.


Don't treat follow-on opportunities as you would an initial base. Follow-on buys are places to spoon in capital.


At a 10-week rebound, in general you don't want to deploy cash worth any more than 20% to 25% of the amount of your full, initial position. At three-weeks-tight buy points, 10% should be a maximum. Much less than 10% is preferable.


Why? Primarily because you want to keep your average cost at a sustainable level.


Your average cost determines your cushion in the stock. Adding more shares at follow-on levels narrows your cushion.


Another point: A stock's first two pullbacks after a breakout are its most promising. A third rebound is more risky. Don't buy beyond the third rebound.


Also, count rebounds only from breakouts from bases. A breakout from a three-weeks-tight pattern does not meet the rebound count.


**Cabot Oil and Gas** ([COG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COG)) executed successful rebounds last year during the weeks ended Sept. 14, Oct. 26 and Dec. 21. **(1)** In that first rebound, Cabot was also breaking out of a long, deep cup with handle. This year, the stock rebounded during the weeks ended Jan. 18 and Feb. 22. **(2)**


It briefly cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern on April 8, **(3)** then pulled back more than 8% below that buy point. This would trigger the golden sell rule of cutting losses, but only for the portion of capital invested at that buy point.

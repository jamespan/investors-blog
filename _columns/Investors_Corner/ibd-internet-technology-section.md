We live in an age of explosive innovation.


Most of us are tightly tied to intelligent phones and Internet access. Many drive hybrid and electric cars. Even self-piloting cars are exploring the roads.


All of this spells opportunity for investors. But seizing those opportunities requires knowledge.


One of the most clear, concise routes to understanding new technologies, their producers and markets is through IBD's Internet & Technology section.


The Internet & Technology section is the work of an experienced crew of editors and reporters, most of them based in Sunnyvale, Calif., who have been chronicling the territory for years.


They keep a tight focus on fresh opportunities and new developments affecting top tech firms.


Those include many obvious company names. But the section also tracks up-and-coming talent, IPOs like **Zynga** ([ZNGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZNGA)) and **HomeAway** ([AWAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AWAY)).


IBD Sunnyvale, Calif., bureau reporter Kevin Shalvey recently revealed the underpinnings of **Facebook**'s ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) [widely criticized IPO price](http://news.investors.com/technology/040513-650771-facebook-confidential-ipo-letters-to-sec.htm). The story was too late to aid investors caught in the misjudged launch. But it gives better footing from which to judge similar launches in the future.


Meanwhile, a story this past week on [fee changes at **EBay** (](http://news.investors.com/technology-tech-exec-qanda/041013-651385-ebay-challenges-amazon-with-seller-fee-overhaul.htm?ref=HPLNews)[EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) , written by IBD tech writer Doug Tsuruoka, hints at a value change in the stock as the company nibbles market share from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


CAN SLIM investors often assess stocks first by their charts and quarterly earnings growth, then track down a company's basic story. I&T provides a chance to put fundamentals — and what's new about a company and its products — first. Company strategy, business development and industry news are center-stage. Financial performance factors like earnings growth play a strong supporting role.


Investors must then pick up the ball and verify a stock's chart status and how institutional investors are handling the stock.


Once you own a stock, the I&T page remains equally vital.


The old rule says buy on fundamentals, sell on technicals. This means a stock's chart action tends to send sell signals before news headlines do.


But IBD writer Brian Deagon's January 2012 forecast that **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) would lose its [cool factor](http://news.investors.com/technology/010412-596371-2012-predictions-includes-woes-for-apple-google.htm) can also flash warnings. Apple's uptrend wasn't done. But within months after the story, industry research showed its iPhone giving up market share to Samsung's Galaxy phones.


Apple shares were sending topping signals within three months. In September, the top stock of the early 21st century folded its tent.

The stock market rarely finds equilibrium — a balance between supply and demand. In fact, [CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) is partially based on pinpointing instances on a stock chart that are furthest from equilibrium — where demand is most likely to outstrip supply. So when you want to locate the big market winners, knowing the role of volume is key.




This is the [S in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-letter acronym for great investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/supply-demand/): It stands for supply and demand. And it is the prevailing reason why IBD discusses volume action regarding the overall market, and tracks volume trends and percentage changes in the number of shares trading hands in individual stocks.


Supply, in stock trading, is gauged at several different levels. The term outstanding shares refers to all of a company's shares, even restricted shares and those held by company executives or long-term investors and which in most cases aren't likely to see the light of day anytime soon.


Another term, the float, subtracts closely held shares from the shares outstanding. This gauge more accurately reflects a stock's liquidity and is more closely related to the action in both price changes and turnover.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Demand from institutional investors — the [I in the CAN SLIM methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/i-in-can-slim-methodology/) — drive winning stock runs. Investors can track that demand using a stock chart's volume characteristics.*

A couple other key terms are important in a stock's supply/demand relationship: the average daily volume and the average daily dollar volume.  The first averages the number of shares traded over 50 days.  In general, seek a minimum average of 400,000 shares for a leading stock. This level of volume helps make the stock more resistant to manipulation by large-scale investors.

The average daily dollar volume combines a stock's price and daily volume to gauge the amount of capital moving in and out of a stock each day. CAN SLIM rules generally call for potential leaders to trade a minimum dollar volume of \$25 million per day.  That is equal to a \$63 stock averaging 400,000 shares a day, or a \$25 stock averaging a daily turnover of 1 million shares.



Used in combination, those measures help investors track the behavior of institutions acting on a single stock.


**Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) offered a good example. The September 2014 IPO consolidated for 27 months before its breakout in the first quarter of 2017.


With a float of more than a billion shares, the stock's supply overwhelmed demand, dragging shares off their high in November 2014 and into a correction more than 50% deep.


Throughout the consolidation, large stabs of buying moved upward from 70 million shares per day **(1)**. As more of those shares fell into the hands of investors set to hold, the big-volume buying gradually began to contain the stock's supply.

Volume levels started to settle as the stock swung into a five-month [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in September. When the stock began forming a handle in January, volume levels dropped to below average **(2)** — exactly what you want to see: The sellers have what they want, and the buyers have established their positions.


The supply is tight, so that any subsequent demand will drive prices higher. Alibaba found a stasis for almost a month and a half, bumping up against its [correct entry price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 104.67. The stock climbed past its buy point in March **(3)**, advancing in 11 of 12 weeks through May 16.


Through the end of May in 2018, Alibaba has rallied as much as 102% from the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

To be a good stock picker, you have to go a step beyond analyzing the chart and the company's quarterly reports. You also have to understand what the company does that's extraordinary and why earnings and sales are growing.

  

First, keep in mind the third letter in IBD's [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) paradigm. It's short for new. You want your company to show or experience something new that is driving earnings higher.

  

It could be a new product or service that customers find irresistible. It could be new management with a plan to turn a lagging company into a leader. Or it could be a change in industry conditions, such as supply shortages or new technology that has a positive effect on overall industry profits.

  

Research by IBD founder [William O'Neil](http://www.williamoneil.com/) found that 95% of stock market winners with stunning growth between 1880 and 2008 fit into one of those three categories.

  

A second reason to truly know the strengths of a top company is that it can give you the conviction that you've picked a winner. You're less likely to be shaken out during a period of temporary weakness â€” because you believe in the company.

  

So, where do you find information on a company that you might have spotted?

  

Your first look should be in IBD's article archives. Type in a ticker in the search box near the top right of the home page at www.investors.com. It will yield a list of stories published by IBD on that company.

  

IBD's [New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm) page singles out top-flight firms and explains what's driving growth. IBD's highly experienced reporters interview analysts and CEOs for insights into the company they're featuring.

  

If the stock you're interested in is in the technology or medical fields, IBD's Internet and Technology section is the place to look. Reporters specializing in these fields stay on top of the fastest-growing companies and report on them regularly. Managing for Success articles also can yield needed information on a company's success formula, along with Leaders & Success articles that profile top CEOs.

  

The company's website also should be a good source of information.

  

IBD prides itself in spotting fast-growing innovative companies before other media outlets. Take the example of **Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)), formerly known as Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.

  

The company pioneered single-service coffee. Rather than brew a whole pot, consumers could make themselves a single cup. Keurig developed its signature single-cup coffee maker. It's easy to use and fast. The company started off in the Northeast and spread westward, then globally.

  

The first in-depth article on this big winner appeared on Nov. 1, 2000, when Green Mountain sold wholesale coffee to a mere 550 New England grocery stores.

  

Since then, IBD has published more than 100 articles, short and long, chronicling the company's rise from a regional specialty-coffee roaster to a global powerhouse that changed the way America drinks coffee.

  

A reader interested in learning about this company could have read in-depth New America articles on May 17, 2007 **(1)**, April 25, 2008 **(2)** and Oct. 28, 2008 **(3)**. Following a breakout in March 2009, Keurig rose 1,116% to a peak in September 2011.

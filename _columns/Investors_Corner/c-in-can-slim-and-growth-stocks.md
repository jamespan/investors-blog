**In Search of CAN SLIM:** [First In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/607647/201204171805/in-search-of-can-slim.aspx)


IBD's CAN SLIM growth stock investing system starts with a C for a good reason.


C stands for current earnings-per-share and sales growth, the two most important factors in identifying a potential winning stock.


Target companies that posted EPS growth of at least 25% from year-ago levels in the most recent quarter or two. The comparison to year-ago figures is used to avoid seasonal distortions.


It's even better if earnings growth has accelerated in recent quarters, going from, say, a 25% increase in Q1 vs. a year earlier to 50% in Q2 and 75% in Q3.


IBD research shows that the biggest winners of the past 50 years posted their biggest profit increases a quarter or two before they took off.


In fact, three out of four among these stocks averaged 70% or more profit growth in the latest quarter right before their big advances.


Keep in mind that the EPS gains should be accompanied by quarterly sales growth of at least 25% in the latest period, though slightly slower but accelerating sales gains can be acceptable.


How can you can find winners?


Scrutinize the Sector Leaders highlighted in the Research Tables in Section B of IBD. They provide the two most recent quarterly profit growth figures and the three-quarter average for both earnings and sales growth.


Charts in Friday's Your Weekly Review give the most recent quarterly EPS change. Monday's IBD 50 and Tuesday's Big Cap 20 charts hold two quarters of data.


Investors.com is another good place to look for potential winners. The Stock Checkup section provides data on the most recent quarter's sales and profit growth, average growth for the past three quarters and the number of quarters of EPS growth acceleration.


Note that rising profits accompanied by slowing sales could be a red flag, indicating that earnings are growing through cost-cutting rather than by new products or strategies.


Also, a couple quarters of drastically slowing profit growth could be a sell signal.


**Hologic** ([HOLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HOLX)), which makes medical diagnostic equipment, broke out above a 23.88 buy point from a cup base in the week ended Nov. 15, 2004 **1**, in more than double its average daily volume.


The breakout came after the company reported an 85% jump in quarterly earnings, following whopping increases of 500% and 220%, respectively, in the prior two quarters. The 85% increase marked the second straight quarter of deceleration, but the result was still strong and was especially robust when compared with the 181% jump in the year-ago quarter.


While Hologic's sales rose a modest 22% in the quarter prior to its breakout, it marked the third straight quarter of accelerating growth. The stock rallied 63% by February 2005.

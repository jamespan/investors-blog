  How To Trade Stocks: Why Counting Bases Is A Crucial Skill In Playing Long Stock Rallies

Playing winning stocks for large rallies and huge profits is a matter of gauging strengths vs. various risks. For those who want to learn how to trade stocks successfully, [The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-in-stocks-investing-for-beginners/) monitors both.




When an investor reaches a point of knowing how to trim or add to holdings deep in a winning stock's run, one important risk-assessment skill is understanding how to count bases.


Most leading stocks can typically run through two or three stages of bases before losing steam and requiring a more serious consolidation. Breakouts from later-stage bases (four or beyond) can be successful. But they carried added risk, and investors should be aware the stock is likely to feel increasing pressure to fall sharply in price as institutional shareholders lock in gains.


A stock advances between stages only when it chalks up a 20% advance between the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of one base and the beginning of [a new consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) — typically the left side high of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), or [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).

Buy points from follow-on buying opportunities such as a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) or strong rebounds off or back above the 10-week moving average do not count. And stocks often roll through multiple bases at each level before managing the 20% gap needed to advance to the next level.


How To Trade Stocks: Learn These Tips On Counting Bases
-------------------------------------------------------



Here are a few base counting basics. First, use [weekly IBD charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=weekly). They provide about two years of price data, making it easier to find each base in the stock's major advance.


Second, don't count a base if it forms well below 10 a share. Low-priced issues are usually avoided by institutions. Third, start counting bases only after a company's fundamentals meet meet The IBD Methodology requirements.


For instance, when a company notches quarterly earnings growth of 25% or more, search for a solid basing pattern.


Finally, the first valid base needs a prior uptrend of 30% or more.


How Broadcom Reset Its Base Count
---------------------------------


One good recent example is **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)). The stock's fundamentals began accelerating at the end of 2013, making May 2014 its first valid breakout past a 65.93 buy point in a [good flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) (see the accompanying weekly chart). A second-stage base started to form in late September the same year. The third-stage began in March 2015.

The May 27 breakout from that base occurred in huge volume and looked successful. It carried shares up 10% in four sessions and up 129% from its 65.93 [initial buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in 13 months. But Broadcom then turned down into a consolidation that dragged shares down more than 30% in fewer than three months.


That consolidation was within the 35% maximum drop outlined for a healthy base, but was easily enough to undercut Broadcom's prior cup base, formed in March through May 2015.


From 3rd Base To 1st
--------------------


The big drop and base undercut essentially reset the stock's base count to first stage. Broadcom wallowed below its June 2015 high of 150.50 for nine months before [staging another breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), this time from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) with a 138.79 entry in the beginning of March 2016, and reigniting its rally.


That sort of pause after a base reset is not unusual, and thus a good reason to keep flagged leaders on your watch list.


In February of 2018, Broadcom undercut the low of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) that formed from August to October of 2017. That correction reset the base count.


Today, shares trade near the top of a new [saucer pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/).

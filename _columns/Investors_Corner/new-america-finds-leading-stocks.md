The 'N' in IBD's [CAN SLIM investment system](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) stands for "new": new products, new markets, new management â€” a company that is reformed or has a fresh strategy.

  

All of these factors may point to a stock that is about to upshift and go places.

  

On the other side of the coin are fundamental factors such as earnings, revenue, margins, debt and return on equity. These factors figure significantly into determining whether a new idea can ultimately fly. Some of the greatest ideas in history failed because the minds behind them couldn't successfully manage a company.

  

IBD's [New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm) feature aims to focus squarely on these aspects of potential leaders. It works to catch them early in a turnaround, soon after they turn profitable or when a groundbreaking product is released. The section then tends to track the stock throughout its advance.

  

**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), a current leader on the IBD 50 list, is a good example. A March 2013 New America piece caught the supplier of video processing chips used in **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) cameras, among other things, just as it was dipping back below the buy point of a seven-week cup base.

  

The stock shot up 10% on March 25 in heavy volume, the same week that the article was published, retaking its 13.52 buy point. It gained 21% for the week and has gained 855%. Shares turned volatile after beginning to flash climax top signals in June, but remain near new highs.

  

New America introduced IBD readers to **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), currently an IBD 50 and Leaderboard stock, in September 2009. The story outlined the company's history, including its brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. The article detailed Ulta's strategy to blend a cosmetics counter with personal care offerings and a hair salon, and outlined its aim to tap into demand for "affordable indulgence" even as the U.S. economy struggled out of its recession.

  

The stock had cleared a three-month base early in September. It formed its next base in January, and has gained nearly 1,300% (so far). Ulta is just below highs, holding above a 159.95 flat-base entry.

  

**Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) is also currently an IBD 50 stock. New America in February 2010 picked up that the stock had posted a 1,942% gain in earnings at the time when most airlines were struggling. The company had trimmed capacity to less profitable markets, directing its aircraft to fly more routes to profit centers. Alaska's focus on North American travel also helped, insulating it from the fall-off in overseas tourism.

  

The stock was just climbing off the bottom of a cup-with-handle base, heading for a March 1 breakout.

  

It is currently trading more than 700% above that early base's buy point. It is just above a 71.50 buy point in late-stage base.

  

These are just a sample of the vast array of winners detailed in New America write-ups. Used in combination with IBD's SmartSelect ratings and features like the weekly Industry Snapshot, they offer a powerful start to any research effort.

  

Obviously, not every stock covered turns out to be a winner. This is why investors need to work hard to build their [trading and research skills](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm), and to know when to properly buy a stock, and how to read the signals that say it is time to sell.

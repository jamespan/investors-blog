In the world of pottery, not all cups come with handles. And the same is true in the realm of stock chart reading.




One key quality of cup-type bases is that they can result in excellent gains for the smart investor. The cup-without-handle base is a U-shaped pattern that's fairly easy to spot on a stock chart.


Such a pattern netted owners of **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODLF)) a rapid 39% gain in 2019 before the stock took a pause.


The cup without handle should have a decline of no more than 33% from the start of the decline to the low. An exception to this is during bear markets, when cup bases can be 50% or more in depth and still work out.


But while it shares some traits with the esteemed cup with handle, there are key differences. The cup without handle can be as short as six weeks, while its cousin needs at least seven weeks to form.


And while the cup with handle has a final shakeout to wash out weak holders, its handleless counterpart instead springs straight to new highs. The buy point is 10 cents above the highest price in the pattern, or the start of the base.


Trucking Stock Delivers After Cup Forms
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IC_122021-279x300.jpg)Trucking play Old Dominion Freight Line formed a textbook cup from late April until July 2019 **(1)**.


Volume action was encouraging. While the initial steep left-side decline on Apr. 26 came in heavy volume, there was enough buying to indicate plenty of institutional support.


The base's ascent saw accumulation pick up, with June 28 a particularly bullish up day. By now, the stock was shooting for an ideal buy point around 163 **(2)**. The July 24 breakout itself came in middling volume **(3)**, but picked up the following week **(4)**.


Once a period of tight trading was overcome, the stock's rising relative strength line guided Old Dominion shares higher.


By the time the stock's run peaked in late February 2020, it had made investors who used the ideal entry point a gain of 39.3%.

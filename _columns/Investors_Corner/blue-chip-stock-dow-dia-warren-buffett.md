What is a blue chip stock? For investing beginners, that question is a good way to start an education.




The [blue chip stock](https://www.investors.com/research/blue-chip-stocks/) is usually characterized by three ingredients.


First, blue chips are often among the biggest stocks in sales and/or market cap (share price times the number of shares outstanding).


[Blue chips](https://www.investors.com/research/blue-chip-stocks/) are thus highly liquid, which means enough shares are available that placing an order is no problem. A small investor can slip in and out of a blue chip without making a ripple in the price.

Second, [blue chip stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/blue-chip-stocks/) usually pay dividends. Income investors are often attracted to blue chips for the steady payout.


Third, blue chips are usually well-known major companies. In the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is arguably comprised entirely of blue chips, even rookie investors have heard of companies such as **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)).


A Rookie's Start In Investing
-----------------------------



Rookie investors often begin their investing career with a stock that is a household name. Warren Buffett bought Citgo, his first stock, at age 11. [IBD founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) bought Procter & Gamble his first stock at age 21.


While buying familiar names isn't a strategy that experienced investors would rely on, it has some value for rookies. How so?


The first stock an investor buys often provides an education. Whether the stock rises, falls or moves sideways, the rookie investor will likely mishandle the situation. (A lack of [sound sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) almost guarantees mismanagement.)


Yet, blue chips can be a good place for rookies to start investing for this reason: They carry lower beta values, meaning they don't usually drop or rise as much as the overall market.


The investor is essentially making mistakes in slow motion.


Take a look at the blue chips in the Dow Jones Industrial Average: As of mid-April, about 63% of the Dow components have a beta below 1.0. (The reading of 1.0 is the volatility reading for the entire market. A reading below 1.0 is less volatile than the overall market.)


A list of top growth stocks, such as [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), has fewer low beta stocks. A recent IBD 50 had 30% of its lineup comprised of low beta stocks, and that was probably higher than normal because of the recent addition of stocks in the [real estate investment trust area](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/reit-leaders-apr-02-2019/).


Blue Chips With Relative Strength
---------------------------------


In the [current stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/), what Dow Jones stocks are worthy of consideration?


Only three stocks showed a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) at or near a high in June. (The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500.)



The three are **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)). Each of these stocks have higher beta readings than most stocks in the Dow.


Buffett And The Blue Chip Stock
-------------------------------


Blue chips are famous for providing a useful hunting ground for Warren Buffett. **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)) has significant stakes in Dow components including [**Apple**](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), Coca-Cola, **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), Visa and **Travelers** ([TRV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRV)).



Together those seven stocks make up about 45% of Berkshire's holdings. Toss in blue chip Berkshire holdings such as **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) (which aren't in the Dow Jones) and Berkshire's blue chip exposure jumps to almost 70%.


Among exchange traded funds, the Dow-based SPDR Dow Jones ([DIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIA)) ETF is a good way to get exposure to blue chips.

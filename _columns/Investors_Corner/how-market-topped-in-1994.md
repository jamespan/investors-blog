  How The Stock Market Topped In 1994

Twenty years ago in the spring to early summer of 1994, the Nasdaq peaked and went into a decline of 14% over 14 weeks.


Understanding how that top emerged is one way to learn to spot the warning signs of a failing market, making this a valuable lesson for stock investors.


As in every major top, institutional investors at that time were ridding themselves of shares. This distribution could be seen each time the major indexes fell in higher volume than the prior session.


A half-dozen such distribution days occurred in the Nasdaq within four weeks before the index rolled over. A concentration of selling like that is usually enough to tip the market on its side.


In early 1994, there had been some declines in higher volume. But those distribution days were spread out at a rate of about one per week.


Starting Feb. 23, however, distribution started quickening. That was the first of six distribution days in three weeks **(1)**.


Notice the Nasdaq was still in a technical uptrend; it made new highs on St. Patrick's Day and the day after, the hangover day **(2)** .


That's another important lesson about distribution days: They are reliable topping signals and can occur while the indexes are still trending higher. Thus, they can give you plenty of time to get out of the market before the worst happens.


The institutional selling that had been building up for weeks came to a head on March 24. The Nasdaq sold off 1.4% in the heaviest trade in weeks; the index started a seven-day losing streak, dropping 10% **(3)**. The rout was on.


Poor action in leading stocks is another warning sign of a failing market. In the spring of 1994, investors should have been alarmed by the breakdowns taking place on those charts.


In the week ended March 25, tech darling **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) plunged 16% and sliced its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. Cisco went on to drop 54% â€” a fitting correction that followed a big run that started with a breakout back in October 1990.


PeopleSoft, at the time a major human resources software publisher, tried to break out in mid-March but failed. By May, the stock slid to 26, 37% off its all-time high.


Also in March, **EMC** ([EMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMC)) tumbled from a breakout attempt while **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) started a 30% correction.

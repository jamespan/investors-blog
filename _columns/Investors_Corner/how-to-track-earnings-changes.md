Research tools in IBD are there to help you find crucial information on leading stocks fast. Some tools seem quite simple, but they are no less important.


Take the small up and down arrows on IBD's weekly mini-charts, for instance. These markings are found right next to the company's latest quarterly earnings-per-share growth rates.


Why care? They can quickly tell you whether a company's business is red-hot or cooling off.


An up arrow simply means that growth in the latest quarter was faster than the prior quarter. Acceleration is desirable. For example, if you see an EPS increase of 25% in Q1, 35% in Q2 and 50% in Q3, the company is clearly doing something right.


On the other hand, a down arrow signals slower growth than the prior quarter. Continued growth deceleration often marks the end of a stock's run.


When scouting growth stocks, investors should look for quarterly increases of at least 25%. Many times, the biggest winners will show quarterly profit growth into the triple digits.


Fast earnings growth is a trait shown before these winners start their advances. In "How To Make Money In Stocks," IBD founder William O'Neil notes that among the factors tracked by IBD's [CAN SLIM investment model](http://education.investors.com/), "None of these characteristics... stood out as boldly as the profits each big winner reported in the latest quarter or two before its major price advance."


Big quarterly profit gains tell you that a firm's products and services are selling like hot cakes. Bottom-line growth also shows whether a company is executing its business strategy.


Investors can see mini-charts annotated with up and down arrows in Sector Leaders (today on Page B1), Stock Spotlight (today on B9), IBD Big Cap 20 (on Tuesday), Your Weekly Review (Friday) and the IBD 50 (Monday and Wednesday in IBD, every day in IBD Leaderboard).


**Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) appeared in the Aug. 13, 2013, edition of Big Cap 20 **(1)**. Its mini-chart at the time showed that in its latest quarter, earnings grew 48% vs. a year ago. An upward-pointing arrow next to that 48% gain marked a sharp increase from a 1% increase in the previous quarter.


The stock would go on to break out from a consolidation in September. It would rally 26% before settling into a flat base. Sands broke out from that flat base in early December and rallied nearly 13% before losing steam **(2)**.

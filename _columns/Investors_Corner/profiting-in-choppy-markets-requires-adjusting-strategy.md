When the stock market is in a strong uptrend, it usually lifts all boats and gives investors plenty of room to run with their stocks.

In a sharp downtrend, IBD readers know to stay away until the trend changes.

But there are times when the markets are choppy and making a profit — even a small one, not the 20% to 25% variety — is frustratingly difficult. In some years, the indexes march higher in an irregular fashion, first dipping into a correction, then bolting out of it to a new high.

If you are trading a lot and your market timing is poor, you risk dying a death by a thousand cuts, losing small amounts of money on trade after trade.

**Employ Self-Knowledge**

There are several things an investor can do.

First, it's important to understand yourself. An experienced trader knows how the twin emotions fear and greed play on him or her.

So, one obvious choice is to stay out of the market and wait for a better climate. If too many trades are going against you, step aside.

Second, take profits and losses more quickly. Instead of taking losses at 7% or 8%, cut them down to 3% or 4%. By the same token, lock in profits at 10%-12%, instead of 20% to 25%. That way, you maintain a 3-to-1 profit-to-loss ratio. To make this work, you have to be laser-focused on buying at the exact buy point. If you're buying a stock more than 5% above that price, a normal pullback will shake you out.

Third, avoid being fully invested or using margin to buy stocks. If trades aren't working for you, you can lose money much faster on margin than if you're trading with a limited amount of your money.

When the market is in a confirmed uptrend, buy stocks coming out of tightly-formed, sound bases with solid breakouts and superior fundamentals. You're only buying quality merchandise. Those are the stocks that are hardest to suppress in a choppy market. Avoid late-stage bases.

The market went through an especially choppy period in 2011 and 2012. And this year, so far, is shaping up the same way.

Going back to 2011 and 2012, one would have noted in The Big Picture column a large number of changes in the market's outlook. The Nasdaq plunged briefly into borderline bear-market territory in October 2011 **1**. There was a tradable rally in the first quarter of 2012 **2**, followed by more choppiness.

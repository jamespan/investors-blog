**Handling A Choppy Uptrend:** *[Seventh and Last In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/621258/201208071356/handling-a-choppy-uptrend.aspx)*

  

Bigger isn't always better if you're an individual investor trying to weather a choppy market.

  

In other words, it's not true that all large-capitalization stocks handle volatile periods better than midcaps or small caps.

  

Big caps often can serve as a safe port in a storm, but in some cases you'll still feel plenty of waves.

  

With this final installment in our Investor's Corner series on handling a choppy uptrend, we're pointing out some highly rated big caps that are actually somewhat volatile.

  

Just keep these examples in mind as you deal with the current market, which has been advancing in a herky-jerky fashion.

  

For starters, don't forget that a big cap is generally a stock with a market capitalization of at least \$10 billion or \$15 billion.

  

We're talking about some big names like **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) (\$92 billion market cap) or **Kraft Foods** ([KFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KFT)) (\$73 billion), not smaller players like **Chiquita** ([CQB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CQB)) (\$264 million) or **Zynga** ([ZNGA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZNGA)) (\$1 billion).

  

Remember also that some big caps still are managing to show strong gains in earnings and revenue — increases of 25% or more — even though they're building off a sizable base.

  

That helps explain the potential for volatility. Sure, these are often well-established companies, but they still can struggle to meet Wall Street's expectations. And that can lead to dives in price that you might not generally associate with such huge players.

  

One way to tell if the big cap you're eyeing is on the volatile side is to check out its beta, a metric that gauges a stock's sensitivity to the general market's movement in either direction.

  

For example, a beta of 1.50 would mean that in the past year, the stock moved 50% more than the S&P 500, either up or down.

  

One example of a volatile big cap would be **Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)), the data storage giant. As shown in the nearby table, Seagate has a beta of 1.56.

  

That means it moved 56% more than the S&P 500 in the last year. Seagate's beta is hardly a surprise when you consider the company operates in a highly competitive and cyclical business. Another data company in the table, **Teradata** ([TDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDC)), has a similar beta.

  

**CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) also appears in the nearby table because of its significant beta. Again, it's not a surprise because fertilizer makers such as CF can be buffeted by the latest crop reports, drought fears, other weather news and other factors.

  

If you're looking for stability, there are of course some highly rated big caps with low betas. **Hershey** ([HSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSY)), **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) all fit the bill. Each has a beta below 0.5, meaning it has been gyrating half as much as the general market.

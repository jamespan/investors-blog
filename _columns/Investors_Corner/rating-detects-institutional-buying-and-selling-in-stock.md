It's important to know how to quickly find companies that are fast growers and are outperforming most stocks in the market. But the ability to tell if a stock is being bought or sold heavily by institutional investors is an equally critical skill for any investor.

  

Keep in mind the goal is always to buy an emerging leader in the early stages of its long run, just as it is being accumulated by a mutual fund, bank or any other big investor. IBD studies of winning stocks show this is the time when big price gains are made.

  

Unfortunately, many investors get it wrong, especially the "buy low, sell high" crowd. Often times, investors try to buy low and sell high but are totally unaware they're buying a stock with shaky fundamentals that's being sold by institutional investors.

  

IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a good way to tell if a stock is in favor — or out of favor — with the big guns on Wall Street.

  

Remember, it's institutional investors that are most responsible for a stock's move up or down. They account for the vast amount of trading volume each day on the exchanges. Therefore, paying attention to what they're buying and selling is paramount.

  

An early burst of institutional buying can be followed up by more of it in coming weeks as large positions are built. By the same token, early signs of institutional selling can result in more selling down the line as positions are unwound.

  

Stocks are rated an A+ to E scale. A-rated stocks are under heavy accumulation. E-rated stocks are under heavy distribution. A C denotes a neutral tone.

  

You generally won't see big changes in the rating on a day-to-day basis because price and volume trends are analyzed over a continuous 13-week period. Higher-volume gains help the rating, but higher-volume declines weigh on the rating. Picture-perfect price action for a stock during an uptrend is heavy-volume gains and low-volume pullbacks. That's a sign that institutions are sitting tight with their positions.

  

When looking in IBD growth screens for breakout candidates, make sure the rating is at least C+. Buying a breakout when a stock has a grade of D or E is riskier. In some cases, the breakouts might work, but the odds won't be in your favor.

  

Think about it for a moment. Does it really make sense to buy a stock amid signs of institutional selling? That's called swimming against the tide, and it's an easy way to lose money in the market.

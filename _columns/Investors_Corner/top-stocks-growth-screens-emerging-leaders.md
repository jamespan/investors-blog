With the stock market uptrend under pressure, top stocks are having problems making headway.




A follow-through day for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 on Nov. 7 was just what the bulls wanted to see, but it didn't take long for selling pressure to build in the market.


Technical breakouts in heavy volume started to struggle almost immediately. Many top stocks, including **Green Dot** ([GDOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDOT)) and **Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)), triggered sell signals soon after [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


It's been frustrating for growth investors, but the savviest ones continued to monitor the market for top stocks holding up well, as well as top stocks setting up for [possible breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). A market uptrend under pressure could get worse amid consistent signs of institutional selling. Or it could get better amid new signs of institutional buying.


If it's the latter, up-to-date watch lists with potentially actionable names are an investor's best friend.


But maintaining a clean watch list of top stocks isn't easy. It takes dedication and discipline — a key trait among successful growth investors. It's also important to know where to look for stocks with the best potential.


Top Stocks In IBD Screens
-------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wIC-111618-300x207.jpg)IBD growth screens at Investors.com like the [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) and [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) have a consistent track record of uncovering big market leaders before they become household names. That's because they focus on stocks with solid fundamentals showing excellent price performance. Search for [leading stocks in the market, not lagging stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/leader-laggard/).


With numerous growth stocks under selling pressure of late, large-cap defensive names like **Clorox** ([CLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLX)), **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) have outperformed.


Similar stocks can be found in the Big Cap 20. It can be accessed, along with other screens, by clicking the Stock Lists tab at the top of the Investors.com home page. Just recently, top Big Cap 20 stocks **Church & Dwight** ([CHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHD)), **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) and **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) were watch-list worthy due to bullish charts.



[Inside the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), **Horizon Pharma** ([HZNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZNP)) is also a great name for the watch list. The stock [gapped out of a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) powerfully on Nov. 7, the same day the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 followed through with conviction on the seventh day of their rally attempts. **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)) and **Motorola Solutions** ([MSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSI)) are also holding up well.


Top Stocks On The Move
----------------------


Monitoring heavy-volume gainers daily in [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) on the home page of investors.com is also worthwhile. Top stocks showing signs of institutional buying are always worth considering, especially if they're on the verge of breaking out or basing in constructive fashion.


**Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) and **Sprouts Farmers Market** ([SFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFM)) appeared in the screen Wednesday. Ubiquiti has been holding gains smartly after it [gapped out of a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) Nov. 9 on strong earnings. Tight action near highs from here could result in an alternate entry. Sprouts, meanwhile, is only 7% off its high as it works on the right side a base with a 29.77 entry.


[Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) name **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) appeared on [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) when the Nasdaq popped 1.7% on Thursday. The enterprise software name reclaimed the 88.98 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in solid volume.

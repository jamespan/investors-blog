0When growth stocks form a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), they almost always contain a flaw or two. So, what can help you decide to invest when they actually [break out to new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/)?

Study the chart action to spot multiple up weeks in a row in price. These bullish runs may include the actual week when a stock moves past a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in heavy turnover.

William O'Neil, [founder of Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), often pointed out that big stock market winners show this bullish pattern before they go on tremendous price runs. The logic is simple, yet powerful.

When a mutual fund decides to build a big stake in a stock, it won't accomplish that goal in a day. It can take weeks if not months to get the position to the right size for a fund that manages hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars.

## Growth Stocks Act This Way Before The Breakout

So when you see a stock go up three, four, five, even six straight weeks, think this: Aha, Monster Growth Inc. is fulfilling two criteria within the [CAN SLIM system of investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/): [the S](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/supply-demand/) (supply vs. demand) and [the I](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) (robust institutional sponsorship).

**RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) has rung up cheery gains for those who bought shares at the Feb. 8 breakout. The specialist in software-as-a-service for business communications rose 4% that day. Volume jumped 50% above its average over the past 50 sessions.

The breakout week was part of nine up weeks in a row **(1)**.

As the weekly chart shows, the stock built a five-month [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) after peaking at 98.15 on Sept. 13, 2018.

The base showed worrisome details.

A 34% correction from head to toe? A bit excessive. See the big weekly price swings in the middle of the cup? Too much wild action is a negative.

Yet in the middle of the base, RingCentral made a bullish reversal at the bottom **(2)**.

Also on the positive side, it never spent more than eight weeks in a row below the 10-week moving average.

## Earnings Boost The Breakout

Soon after the Feb. 8 [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), RingCentral got moving. Shares jumped 6% in heavy volume on Feb. 12, a day after the Belmont, Calif., firm posted a 64% rise in Q4 earnings per share. Revenue grew 34% to \$188.6 million — at that time, the highest ever in a single quarter.

RingCentral made a series of new highs and price pullbacks ranging from 10% to 13%. On March 8, it hit a session low of 98.19, 6 cents below the 98.25 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But RingCentral swung higher later in the day for a bullish reversal. No sell signal for those with true conviction in the company.

On July 30, the stock made a new high of 146.38, up 49% in five months.

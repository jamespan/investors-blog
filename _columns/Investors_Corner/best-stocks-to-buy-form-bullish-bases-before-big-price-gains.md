  Best Stocks To Buy Form Bullish Bases Before Big Price Gains

IBD research has consistently found that the best stocks to buy look very similar before making huge price gains. Big earnings and sales growth is one common trait. Another is that they form proper bases before starting major price advances.




What exactly is a base? Simply put, it's a period of time where a stock pauses and digests gains after a strong run-up. A basing period is needed after a big price gain. It allows a stock to go through a period of profit-taking and not get overheated. When sellers eventually exit the stock, many of the best stocks to buy start rallying again and test their former highs.


Best Stocks To Buy Form Sound Bases
-----------------------------------


Only a few types of bases are considered reliable.


When selling pressure starts to build in the indexes, a stock might pull back 30% or so off its high, bottom out, then start working its way higher. The U-shaped pattern that results is known as a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Sometimes, cup bases can form handle areas, turning them into [cup-with-handle bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The handle area serves to shake out sellers ahead of a possible breakout. Ideally, the handle will drift lower in light volume. Heavy volume as a handle forms makes the overall pattern flawed.


A [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) can show a similar pullback to a cup base, but the base shows two legs down, giving the base the appearance of the letter W. The second leg must undercut the first, which serves to shake out sellers.


A [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) forms after a period of sideways movement where the stock doesn't correct more than 15% off its high. Flat bases tend to form when the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend with little selling pressure. The tighter the trading, the better for a flat base.


Some of the [best flat bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) show pullbacks in the 8%-12% area. Flat bases can be shorter than others, as little as five weeks. Tight sideways trading after a breakout is a sign of strength and support. It's ideal price action to see as a flat base forms.


All Bases Have Unique Buy Points
--------------------------------


In all bases, the time to buy is when the stock tops key resistance. In the double bottom, it's the middle peak. In the flat base and cup bases, it's the prior high.


**ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) proved itself one of the best stocks to buy in 2020 in the enterprise software group. Soon after [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) days that confirmed the market bottom in early April of that year, ServiceNow set up in a cup base that yielded a powerful breakout in early May.


Despite several heavy-volume weekly declines as the left side of the base formed, ServiceNow's base corrected a reasonable 34%. The stock formed the right side of its base and eventually broke out over a 363.05 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), helped by a bullish up week in high volume the week ended May 1. That's when shares soared 12% in higher volume, just ahead of the breakout.


If a pattern doesn't qualify as a base, it may be undefined but still have bullish characteristics.

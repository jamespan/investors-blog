When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton reportedly said: "Because that's where the money is."

  

The famed robber eventually denied ever uttering that phrase, ascribing it instead to "some enterprising reporter who apparently felt a need to fill out his copy."

  

But it's still a great statement reflecting common sense. So let's borrow it in discussing initial public offerings, or IPOs.

  

Growth investors can't ignore new issues. Why? Because that's where the big growth is.

  

IBD's research has found that 80% of the stocks that had outstanding price performance in the 1980s and '90s had been brought public in the prior eight to 10 years.

  

With that in mind, the stock tables in eIBD and the print edition highlight young and promising companies trading on the NYSE and Nasdaq.

  

A triangle symbol marks all of the issues that have EPS and RS Ratings of 80 or more and were IPOs in the last 15 years. These criteria give readers an even wider screen.

  

Another key tool for keeping tabs on young companies is a table titled "IPO Filings Soon To Be Priced." It's found today in The New America, on Page A9. This table gives the upcoming IPO's name, its ticker symbol and a description of its business. It also provides the location of the firm's headquarters, its industry group and other key information.

  

So once you've identified a promising new issue, what's your next step?

  

Keep in mind that you don't really want to change your rules about investing just to get exposure to an IPO.

  

You still want to demand strong fundamentals. Whether it's a young or well-established public company, IBD always recommends looking for quarterly profit and revenue growth of at least 25%.

  

Remember what IBD's founder and chairman, William J. O'Neil, said in his best-seller "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

He wrote: "You have the choice of investing in thousands of companies, many of which are actually showing strong operating results. You don't have to accept promises of earnings that may never occur."

  

Anyone who took that statement to heart wouldn't have been tempted by, for example, **E-Commerce China Dangdang** ([DANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DANG)), dubbed China's **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), or **Youku.com** ([YOKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YOKU)), called China's answer to YouTube.

  

Youku broke out of an initial base and rallied to new highs. But recently, both of those stocks have performed poorly. That's about what you would expect given that they continue to post quarterly losses. Sure, Youku is holding above its IPO price. But when you look at the price where retail investors actually could buy shares, it's under that level.

  

As with any stock purchase, part of your decision should be based on analysis of the stock's chart action.

  

You want to buy shares when the issue breaks out of a base. Avoid buying shares during the first few days or weeks of trading.

  

O'Neil wrote: "The safest time to buy an IPO is on the breakout from its first correction and base-building area. Once a new issue has been trading in the market for one, two, or three months or more, you have valuable price and volume data that you can use to better judge the situation."

  

It's OK if the base is slightly unconventional. IPO bases often don't completely resemble conventional consolidations.

Human nature and the law of supply and demand never change in the stock market. It was the same in the 1920s as it is now. That's why history repeats itself.

Decades of IBD research have shown that distribution days are always seen at market tops and follow-through days are always seen at market bottoms.

And when it comes to individual stocks, past market winners looked a lot alike before big price moves. Not only was there a compelling fundamental story in place, but charts were telling a bullish story as well.

This latest Investor's Corner series debuted in Wednesday's edition with an analysis of **Cisco Systems** ' ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) breakout from a double-bottom base in October 1990. The series will look at qualities of winning stocks before they took off on their big price runs.

**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) is today's focus. It cleared a similar pattern in March 1990. Amgen and Cisco were two very different companies. But for both, innovation was fueling big growth ahead of major price moves.

The double-bottom pattern generally should not correct more than 30%. Amgen's was reasonable at 29%.

Keep in mind, though, that a growth stock can often correct 1-1/2 to 2 times what the broad market does, so a 20% pullback in an index could cause some bases to correct up to 40% and still be normal.

Amgen's pattern had nice symmetry. It looked like the letter W, with the second leg down undercutting the first **(1)**, a key attribute of the pattern. When the second low undercuts the first, it shakes out sellers, making a successful breakout more likely.

The shakeout week was positive, but so was Amgen's close that week. It rebounded off its lows, closing in the upper 59% of its weekly range. It showed that buyers were around despite a weekly decline of nearly 6%. Shares had fallen as much as 17%.

The breakout in a double pattern is when the stock clears the middle part of the W-shaped pattern. Amgen broke out over a buy point of 27.85 in mid-February, but volume was slow to come into the stock.

Sometimes, big volume takes a while to show up. Volume was heavy when shares surged nearly 7% about a month later **(2)**.

In the early 1990s, the "N" — for "new" — component of CAN SLIM was there in spades for Amgen.

A new CEO was in place after George Rathmann handed the reins to Gordon Binder. On the heels of its blockbuster drug Epogen, which the FDA approved in 1989, Amgen launched the cancer treatment Neupogen in 1991. In 1992, product sales for both drugs hit \$1 billion, and Amgen became an S&P 500 component. Heavy spending on research and development was finally paying off.

Most impressive about Amgen's breakout was how it was able to sustain itself after the Nasdaq went into a sharp correction in the summer. The Nasdaq corrected 31% off its high after Iraq invaded Kuwait, causing oil prices to spike and throwing the U.S. economy into recession.

Amgen was unfazed by weakness in the broad market. It rode its 10-week moving average even when selling in the broad market started to pick up. The most it ever pulled back was 20%, when it formed a base in the fall. After a breakout in November **(3)**, it doubled in about three months.

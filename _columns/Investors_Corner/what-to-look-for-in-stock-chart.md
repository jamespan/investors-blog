  Action Within Base Offers Clues To Strength, Weakness

Down weeks in soft trade in a base can telegraph something positive.


Think of it this way. Your boss can point out an error in private in a calm voice. Or your boss can publicly scream, "You idiot! What were you thinking?"


The first might help you do your job better. The second means it's time to find a new job.


A stock will do similar things within a base. The stock that falls in quiet volume is communicating stability and laying the groundwork for better action ahead. A stock that plunges in red-faced rage is signaling that you need to find something else to buy or hold.


RV maker **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) began forming a base after a weekly closing high in the week ended July 12, 2013. The pattern was second stage. A first- or second-stage breakout is more likely to work than later-stage breakouts, so this was good.


The first two red weeks came in average to below-average trade **1**. (IBD's charts on www.investors.com show down weeks in red, up weeks in blue.) The closes were tight. As declines go, this action was quite good.


After a quiet up week, there were two more red weeks **2**. Volume was slightly below average in the first week, again a sign of restraint. The second week was in volume 14% above average, but the close was in the upper half â€” a sign of support.


After another quiet up week, two more red weeks again followed. Volume was whisperlike in both weeks **3**. The weekly ranges and closes were tight. This was an ideal, textbook decline.


There were no more red weeks. Winnebago built the right side of the 11-week base in rising volume and broke out in the week ended Oct. **4**.


At the time it crossed the 25.25 buy point, IBD noted the breakout in the Spotlight [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-spotlight/100313-673679-winnebago-is-in-buy-zone.htm) with this headline, "RV Stocks Must Be Played Differently Than Many Stocks."


The article noted that RV stocks are cyclical and "investors shouldn't get too greedy."


The way to avoid getting too greedy is outlined in William O'Neil's 2003 [book](http://www.amazon.com/Successful-Investor-Million-People-Profitably-ebook/dp/B000VICPCM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=) , "The Successful Investor." Profits for most stocks should be taken when the stock is up 20% to 25% from the proper entry. Winnebago reached the profit-taking zone in the week ended Nov. 29 4.


Three weeks later, the stock plunged 16% in heavy volume as it began a new consolidation.

Many investors believe that buying a wide range of stocks is the key to reducing risk. IBD research shows the opposite is true.

IBD-style investors thoroughly research a stock's fundamental and technical characteristics before buying, and then continuously monitor its behavior afterward. This takes time, but it tends to produce a highly focused, high-quality portfolio.

Using such a disciplined approach makes it almost impossible for an individual investor to select and manage a portfolio of, say, 20 or 30 stocks or more. Only big institutions have the resources to evaluate and keep tabs on such a large group of stocks.

"Keep things manageable. The more stocks you own, the harder it is to keep track of all of them," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

People with \$20,000 to \$200,000 to invest should spread their cash over just four or five stocks. Those with \$5,000 to \$20,000 should consider buying no more than three stocks, and those with \$3,000 should buy only one or two, O'Neil writes.

When you're right, you want to be right in a big way.

"The winning investor's objective should be to have one or two big winners rather than dozens of very small profits," O'Neil wrote. "The best results are achieved through concentration, by putting your eggs in a few baskets that you know well and watching them very carefully."

The table accompanying this column shows how four stocks can sharply outperform a portfolio in which each position makes up just 5% of the entire stake.

Investors should start building a list of stocks to watch, focusing on leaders of strong industry groups. Each stock's key fundamental and technical characteristics can be found by clicking on the Research tab at Investors.com and selecting [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup).

Always check the Market Pulse box accompanying the [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) to make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend before buying any stock. When a carefully chosen stock hits its buy point in volume that's at least 40% above average, it's time to buy.

Also, remember to keep monitoring your stocks for follow-on buy points or sell signals that can help you either maximize your gains or limit your losses.

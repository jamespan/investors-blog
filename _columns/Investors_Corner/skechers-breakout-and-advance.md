If you missed Skechers' breakout in early 2015, you might feel like kicking yourself. Perhaps a better response would be to study the shoe maker's chart and its fundamentals and then to resolve you won't miss the next one.

  

The stock should have stood out as an obvious winner. It was easy to buy **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) at the right time and relatively easy to hold.

  

Skechers also issued a loud sell signal at the top.

  

But the stock's IBD proprietary ratings were initially only so-so, and that might have caused some investors to take a pass.

  

On Feb. 11, the [Composite Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-skechers-u-s-a-inc-cl-a-skx.aspx) was 81, which was good but not great. However, keep in mind that the company was staging a big turnaround.

  

**A Respectable RS Grade**

  

The EPS Rating was 76, meaning that in terms of long- and short-term earnings-per-share growth, Skechers was superior to 76% of all companies in IBD's database.

  

Skechers' Relative Strength Rating was highly respectable at 93 out of a maximum 99. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a not-very-good D+.

  

The company was recovering from its disastrous introduction of Shape-ups toning shoes that led the company to bleed red in 2011. But by Feb. 11, 2015, it had multiple quarters of triple-digit year-over-year earnings-per-share increases.

  

A line of newer shoes, ranging from dress to casual, was selling well in the company's 350-plus stores and in wholesale channels. A performance line of running shoes was also being well received. Skechers sells to major department stories, including Macy's.

  

Here's the lesson: Pay attention to successful turnarounds. They make up as much as one fourth of winning stocks.

  

After the close Feb. 11, the stock reported earnings that were 78% above the result a year earlier. The next day, the stock gapped up and out of a cup-with-handle base with a 21.09 buy point, jumping 4% on volume 281% above average (please see a daily chart). That was the day to buy.

  

During the stock's entire advance, it rode comfortably above its 50-day moving average. The stock's ascent was gradual at first, although it moved in a tight fashion. By April 22, it had risen 20%, a point where some investors could have taken profits. But the investor who sweated out the earnings report after the close was richly rewarded. EPS rose 85%, and the stock gapped up and ran 15% the next day.

  

The stock rose 22% for the week, but it wasn't a climax top **(1)**. The stock rose 14 of the next 15 weeks. The lesson: Climax tops don't happen until at least 18 weeks after a breakout. Skechers was only 11 weeks from its breakout, so the stock should be held.

  

The next earnings report was July 29, and it sent the stock gapping up again the next day. The stock rose 22% for the week **(2)**. It was Week No. 25, so it was a climax run, and the stock should have been sold that day or the next day.

  

It wasn't long before Skechers had given back that climatic gain. And it wasn't long before the stock gave back even more, soon after a 3-for-1 stock split.

  

Today, the stock trades more than 40% below its 54.53 peak.

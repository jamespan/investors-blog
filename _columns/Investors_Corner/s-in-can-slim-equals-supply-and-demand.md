  The S In CAN SLIM: Look At Supply And Demand

Just as it's easier to move a kayak than a cruise liner, companies with a smaller number of shares are more likely to catapult higher than a big, mature company.

  

That's the essence of the 'S' in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/), which stands for supply. Buy stocks where demand for shares exceeds the supply.

  

Given a choice between buying a good company with 5 billion shares and an equally good company with 50 million, go for the smaller one. That's not to say a big-cap stock can't make a big advance, but the smaller one might make the bigger move.

  

But beware of going too small. Check trading volume. Avoid filling your portfolio with stocks that trade an average of less than 400,000 shares a day.

  

Also check the daily average dollar volume. A \$50 stock that averages a million shares a day has a daily dollar volume of \$50 million. That's plenty big enough.

  

Sometimes, a stock might seem to have a low average daily volume, but the price of a share might be several hundred dollars. So do a quick mental calculation to make sure the average dollar volume is high enough.

  

Savvy investors watch the float, which is the amount of shares available for trading on the open market. The IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 mini charts carry the float. Shares not in the float are closely held, perhaps by corporate officers.

  

The point of checking the share float and trading volume is that you want to buy stocks that institutional investors, such as mutual funds and hedge funds, are buying.

  

Big institutions don't buy thinly traded low-priced stocks. They are too hard to get in and out of without affecting the price in a major way.

  

And you shouldn't either.

  

Excessive stock splits can increase the number of shares and often occur as a stock makes a major top. By itself, a stock split is a neutral event. The value of the shares you hold is the same after the split as before. But companies get carried away and split several times over the course of a long run over a couple of years. That creates too large a supply of stock, and the stock may be due for a big correction.

  

The same occurs with an extreme split, such as 4-for-1 or even 10-for-1. A 3-for-2 split is better.

  

Overall, there are fewer stock splits today than in the 1980s and 1990s, and some extreme splits have not hurt a stock.

  

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) split 10-for-1 in May 2010, and the stock kept advancing. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) split 7-for-1 in June 2014 and has kept rising, but only after the stock took a bath in 2013.

  

Companies that buy back their own shares in the open market are good for investors. Buybacks can help decrease the supply of stock. It may have the added advantage of boosting earnings per share if the overall share count drops.

  

The best way to evaluate supply and demand for a stock is to analyze a daily or weekly chart. Look for signs that institutional investors are buying shares with gusto. A stock that goes up on higher volume than it goes down over a period of time is showing signs of accumulation.

  

**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) is a good example. It broke out at 78.28 in October and is up 28%. The stock has only 55 million shares outstanding and a float of 51 million. Its long base shows plenty of signs of accumulation. And it bought back \$97 million in shares during 2013.

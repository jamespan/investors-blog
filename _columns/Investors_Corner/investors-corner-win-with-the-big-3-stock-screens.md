IBD offers three key stock screens that are refreshed once per week: the IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and the Big Cap 20.

  

This Investor's Corner column will look at why you might want to use all three as you form a watch list for your stock investments.

  

It also will explain what sets each one apart from the others.

  

For the most part, you should consider using the different screens because each sheds light on a separate part of the stock market.

  

• **IBD 50:** This screen, which appears in the Monday edition, should be viewed as a list of the stocks that have been leading the market. Among the big winners featured in the IBD 50 in recent years were **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Concho Resources** ([CXO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CXO)), **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).

  

As you can tell by these names, they tend to be No. 1 in their industries. This satisfies the L in IBD's CAN SLIM investment method, or "Leader."

  

No matter whether the market is mired in a correction or rallying, the IBD 50 features stocks showing strength. So when the general environment is bearish, you still can see which names are faring better than most.

  

Oftentimes, these resilient stocks will turn into the market's new leaders once it finally gets back into rally mode. The IBD 50, in effect, is giving you some insight into the market's future leaders.

  

• **Your Weekly Review:** This screen is the widest of the three.

  

It appears in every Friday edition. It can run to 120 stocks or more, but often falls below that level when the market is struggling.

  

All stocks in this screen have EPS and Relative Price Strength ratings of at least 85 (both out of a best-possible 99). They must also be trading within 15% of their highs.

  

This screen has a less stringent requirement for average volume. If you see a stock in Your Weekly Review and wonder why it's not in the IBD 50, frequently the difference comes from the issue being somewhat thinly traded.

  

It's best to trade stocks that can be held by big institutional investors who have the power to really drive it higher. But being thinly traded is not necessarily a fatal flaw, and so this IBD screen generally offers some small-cap or even micro-cap names.

  

• **Big Cap 20:** This screen contains growth stocks that are real heavyweights.

  

It runs in Tuesday's IBD. Because Big Cap 20 stocks all have a market capitalization of at least \$15 billion, they generally are less volatile.

  

That makes this screen particularly well-suited for stock investors who are more risk averse — or those looking to add a relatively calm name to an otherwise aggressive portfolio. There are still no guarantees with big-cap stocks, but overall such names are steadier.

  

Even so, Big Cap 20 issues generally show strong growth, meaning double-digit percentage gains in EPS and sales. They lead their industry group, holding better IBD Composite Ratings than similarly sized companies in their sector.

  

The Big Cap 20 lineup has recently featured some stocks with lackluster fundamentals. That reflects the state of the market, which has slumped and exhibited volatility.

  

When you mull buying Big Cap 20 issues, use the same rules as always. Seek strong fundamentals and breakouts from proper bases.

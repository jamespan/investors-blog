**In Search of CAN SLIM:** [Last In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/607647/201204171805/in-search-of-can-slim.aspx)

Captain Horace Bixby, in Mark Twain's "Life On the Mississippi," had just ordered his apprentice pilot to go against his every instinct and steam over what the young man thought was a reef in the river.

The captain knew the shoal was one of the Mississippi's countless illusions. When the boat glided easily over the mirage, the young man asked the captain how he'd ever learn to recognize the difference.

"I can't tell you," the captain said. "It's an instinct. By and by, you will just naturally know one from the other, but you will never be able to explain why or how you know them apart."

The stock market often feels — and in many ways is — just as vexing. Yet it is also just as learnable. And one of its most important rules is to always keep tabs on whether the tide is rising or contracting.

That's why the "M," the final letter in the CAN SLIM investing approach, urges to always be mindful of the currents of the market.

IBD and Investors.com provide some crucial tools to help track that ebb and flow. Here are a few vital starting points:

Every day, the Pulse provides the market's current status and a quick gauge of the day's action. [The Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/Investing/BigPicture.htm) provides detail, context and cues on how to manage your positions and what to watch for.

With a new layout introduced in Wednesday's edition, these features have moved back to the newly named "What's The Market Trend?" page, today on Page B2.

On that page, you will find charts of the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500, the NYSE composite and IBD's Mutual Fund index. This page is designed to help you correctly time your market entry and exit. The Big Picture highlights key action on these charts so you exactly know the current trend.

At the bottom of the page you'll find several other charts that provide a look into investor sentiment.

When the Puts vs. Calls chart rises above 1.20 during a market correction, it often signals a spike in fear. Likewise, the Bulls Vs. Bears graph is a contrarian indicator. When bears exceed bulls, the market is often near the end of a decline and likely headed higher.

For a traffic-light-like approach to the market's status, run any ticker through the Stock Checkup on Investors.com.

The second indicator shows market status, either "Confirmed Uptrend," accompanied by a green light, or "In Correction," marked by a red light. Green means go. Red means hold your horses. A yellow light means the uptrend is under pressure — a time to be cautious.

Learning the market requires time and effort.

Again, like the Mississippi, it is very learnable. And Twain ultimately found Bixby's words to be true.

"The face of the water, in time, became a wonderful book... it was not a book to be read once and thrown aside, for it had a new story to tell every day," he wrote.

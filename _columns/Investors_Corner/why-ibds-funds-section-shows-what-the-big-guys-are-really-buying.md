Do you breeze by IBD's Funds section each day? If yes, not so fast. Stop and absorb the useful hints, ideas and information offered there -- even to investors who prefer to build their own portfolios, rather than pay someone else to invest for them.

In the "Funds & Personal Finance" section of the new IBD Weekly print edition, you'll find a small yet uniquely valuable featured "Growth Funds Leading The Market." In this box, you'll see two funds highlighted.

These will be two of the market's 40 best funds, as determined by ownership of market leaders, highest average Composite Ratings and performance relative to the S&P 500.

In the week of Aug. 22, IBD showcased two funds with excellent long-term performance: American Century Growth Investors ([TWCGX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWCGX)) and Fidelity Contrafund ([FCNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCNTX)). Both specialize in large cap stockpicking.

So, what will you see in each of these boxes? First, these funds' 10 largest U.S. holdings. Look carefully. You know by now that stocks live or die by institutional sponsorship. This is your chance to see what the big guys are accumulating.

Going back in time, MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund ([OTCAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTCAX)) was featured in the Feb. 9, 2012, issue of IBD. Look at their top 10 holdings. See anything interesting?
You'll find **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), which has since more than tripled after a breakout in mid-October of 2011.

**Ametek** ([AME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AME)), a maker of motors, power meters and transducers, was still within buying range from its recent push from a cup with handle before going on a long, steady run through the next two years. Since late 2015, Ametek has been in base-building mode, consolidating its big gains.

Cosmetics name **Estee Lauder** ([EL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EL)) also appeared within the top 10 holdings of the Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund, also featured on the same day. The stock went on to build a number of bases amid a slow yet steady rally.

As you scan through these top funds' holdings, you might feel vindicated by seeing names you may already have identified. You'll also find others that haven't grabbed your attention.

Now scan to another column in each box. "Top New Buys" shows stocks that have recently hit the fund's radar. This gets very interesting. You're seeing stocks that this top-rated fund is in a hurry to buy. The MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund has been pushing to rake in shares of **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), which has been rising for months in tight trade. The stock has since climbed more than 150% through its recent peak of 64.10.

Finally, the fund's Top Sells tell you what the fund is unloading. These names aren't necessarily in trouble, because everyone needs to take a profit at some point.

The section also offers two screens of the best funds within a certain strategy -- value, international, corporate bonds, government bonds and mixed allocation. In the Feb. 9 IBD, 25 of the "Top Balanced-Asset Allocation Funds" and "Top Corporate Bond Funds" were highlighted.

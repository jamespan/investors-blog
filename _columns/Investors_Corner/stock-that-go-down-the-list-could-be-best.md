When the market corrects, leading stocks tend to correct more.


During an intermediate market correction, a leader typically corrects 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the market average. So if the market corrects 10%, the leaders might correct 15% to 25%. Be suspicious of anything greater than that, although a few volatile winners can correct more.


But the best choices are often the stocks that corrected the least. After all, they are the ones institutions were most reluctant to sell as the market headed south.


That's likely because the smart money has the most confidence those companies have a bright future. They're not going to be shaken out because of a little market turbulence.


Take the example of **Lowe's Cos.** ([LOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOW)) in August 1982. If the date rings a bell with you, congratulate yourself for knowing a bit of market history. That was the beginning of one of the 20th century's great bull markets.


Lowe's was founded in 1946 as a hardware store in North Carolina owned by Carl Buchan, who wanted to build a chain of hardware stores. His timing was perfect. The post-World War II building boom was about to begin. Today, Lowe's has more than 1,800 stores.


In 1982, Lowe's would lead the new bull market. From May 1981 until August 1982, the S&P 500 fell 25% **1**. From May 1982 until the bottom, the fall was 16%. But Lowe's was hanging tough during that final descent. It corrected only 11% **2**, remarkable for a growth stock during that time. The final base was part of a much larger structure.


Volume during the flat base was generally light and the daily chart showed signs of accumulation, especially in the latter days.


The follow-through day of Aug. 17 signaled the new bull market. And guess what? Lowe's broke out past a 15.85 entry point that very day, one of the first leaders to emerge in the new uptrend.


It was up nearly 10% that day and volume was 106% above its 50-day average. The next day, it was up another 6% and volume was more than 10 times above average. Lowe's would gain 135% before the year was out.

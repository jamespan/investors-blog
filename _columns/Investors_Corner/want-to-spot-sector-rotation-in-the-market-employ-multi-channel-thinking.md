A common question that IBD receives from readers is a smart one.

The question: How can someone improve his or her market vision at spotting sector rotation?

IBD is one of the most qualified organizations in the world to answer this. How so?

The newspaper's founder, William O'Neil, pioneered the study of changes in price momentum among various industries. With the help of an IBM mainframe computer in the 1960s, O'Neil began presenting institutional clients a market picture that framed not only leading stocks but top-notch industry groups over specific time frames, such as the past six months.

Thanks to those efforts, every IBD reader today can track the market like a pro.

If you become savvy at spotting the emerging winners in terms of industries, you've got a leg up. The rationale: If the airline stocks as a group are outstripping the ethical drug firms, then an investor is going to likely make more money with timely purchases of the best stocks in the airline industry. O'Neil's research determined that up to half a fantastic stock's move is connected to the strength of both its specific industry group and its broad sector.

Here are some tips:

**Look at top industry groups:** Keep an eye out for those that jump into the top 20, or even the top 40 among the 197. An easy way to do this: Check the bottom of the General Market page, which is a PDF link at the bottom of the daily [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).

What is that breakout stock's industry group? Find out fast at [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). When a market uptrend warms up, more breakouts tend to come from the same sectors or industry groups. **Lumentum** ([LITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LITE)), **Oclaro** ([OCLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCLR)) and **Finisar** ([FNSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNSR)) hail from the fiber-optics industry group. Telecoms have thrived in 2016, and the Telecom-Fiber Optics group has ranked No. 1 among [197 IBD groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-oct-20-2016/) for weeks.

As you check the industry group rankings, also scan the ranking of 33 broad sectors listed in IBD's stock research tables, which begin on page B6 in the latest IBD Weekly print edition. These rankings can change dramatically over time. Sector Leaders and other young companies with outstanding EPS and RS ratings receive special attention at the top of each sector.
**New High List:** The stocks are categorized by sector. Lately, bank, financial, medical and select tech plays have led. At Investors.com, the [list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-20-2016/) is updated each day under "IBD Data Tables" in the Stock Lists section.

**Scan Stock Market Today:** This Investors.com-only feature highlights breakouts. Lately, Wall Street banks such as **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), and **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)), have joined the breakout train.

**What's on Leaderboard? Sector Leaders?** The former is curated, the latter is computer screen-driven. Both lists tend to show high-growth companies that are coming from the strongest industries.

**See Stocks On The Move**: This incredibly useful [table](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx), found on both the home page and under the "Stock Lists" tab of Investors.com, shows only those stocks making big price moves. Write down the tickers, especially the ones you don't know, then check out their industry group in IBD Stock Checkup. Maybe certain sectors are sticking out. Don't forget the stocks going down too; it can help you spot emerging weakness in a leading sector.

**Follow top-performing ETFs**: IBD's [ETF Leaders column](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/etf-leaders/), which appears in the ETFs section of IBD Weekly, has noted strength in certain commodities such as coal, mining as well as tech-oriented sectors such as semiconductors.

**Take a step back**: Consider what trends at work and in life are emerging. **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) wouldn't have been a top growth stock in the 1990s if the internet didn't take root. In the mid-2000s, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) would have stayed an also-ran if it didn't keep innovating in the field of computers, digital music and phones.

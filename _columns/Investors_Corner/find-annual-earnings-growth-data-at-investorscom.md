**In Search of CAN SLIM:** [Second In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/607647/201204171805/in-search-of-can-slim.aspx)


CAN SLIM investing revolves around the premise that leading stocks — those that break out of bases and achieve significant advances — tend to share a list of identifiable traits.


Learning to recognize and assess those traits before a stock launches into a winning run is a big part of learning to profit from the strategy.


Among the most important of those characteristics is the A in CAN SLIM: superior annual earnings growth.


As a general rule, demand at least 25% EPS growth in each of the past three years. Leading stocks that staged big runs from 1980 to 2000 held median annual earnings growth of 36% at the start of their move. Three of four big winners also showed at least some increase in the rate of annual earnings growth for three years, in some cases for five years, prior to their winning runs.


One of the best places to determine a stock's annual earnings performance is Investors.com.


A good place to start: the Get Quote function on the home page. Type in a stock ticker. A data block will appear that gives you the three-year average growth rate for the stock's annual earnings.


For a next step, try the annual earnings portion of [IBD's Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/StockCheckup.aspx). You can get there by clicking on the blue rectangle near the top of the stock quote page.


A three-line data block gives you the average growth rate over the past three years, the number of consecutive years in which the company has boosted annual EPS, and the analysts' consensus estimate for the current year's EPS growth.


A green dot to the right of the data tells you the number meets or exceeds the CAN SLIM standard. A red dot says the numbers fall short.


Another powerful tool for finding and sorting top stocks is [eTables](http://research.investors.com/eTables/Default.aspx). This instrument, which requires a separate subscription, gives you five populations of potential leaders: The IBD 50 list, the New America index, the 85-85 index, the Big Cap 20 list and the Main tables, which combine all the stocks from the prior lists.


The page provides a column showing the stock's analyst consensus earnings estimate for the current year. It also provides a sorting tool so you can rank stocks in any of the first four lists according to their annual earnings estimates.


It sounds simple. And at the most basic level, to start, it is.


As you refine your skills, you'll continually find crucial subtleties to annual earnings numbers. A company's earnings may have grown 25% above the prior year, but if quarterly growth slowed sharply late in the year after a big spurt in the first half, a company could be headed for trouble.


If revenue growth is outpacing earnings growth and margins are narrowing, a company may be running up against stiff competition, or unsustainable levels of employee or raw material costs.


As always, keep your eyes and mind open, and happy hunting.

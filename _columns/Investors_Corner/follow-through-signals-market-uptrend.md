  Stock Market Crash Always Precedes This Signal Of A New Market Bottom

Big stock gains that vanish can force an investor to rethink everything. Just look at what's happened in the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) that took hold on Feb. 25. Just weeks later, it became a crash.




But that's also what happened to [William J. O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) decades ago.


In late 1961, he studied what went wrong and learned how to handle the sell side, says the founder and chairman of IBD. Along the way, he also discovered a way to identify a market bottom.


It's called a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


The follow-through essentially tells investors when it's safe to start buying quality stocks again. In the more than five decades since he began tracking this signal, O'Neil says he's never seen a bull market that didn't begin with a follow-through day.


It's not about perfection, though.

While no rally has ever begun without one, [not every follow-through day succeeds](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). Accept the fact that some bursts of strong institutional buying sometimes turn out to be bull traps. That's why you don't want to jump back in the market 100% on a follow-through day. You want to start buying in stages and let the rally prove itself. Plus, it may take weeks, if not months, for a crop of excellent growth stocks with superior fundamentals to finally [break out of a well-formed base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and stage big price gains.

After A Stock Market Crash, Search For The Follow-Through
---------------------------------------------------------


When the market is in a correction, look for at least one major index — particularly the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 — trying to rally. The first day that the index closes higher counts as Day 1 of its attempted rally. The action on Day 2 and Day 3 is irrelevant as long as the index doesn't undercut its recent low. If it is undercut, the rally try is done and the market needs to try again.


On Day 4 and later, you are looking for the index to rise sharply in higher volume than the previous session's.


Sometimes, a legitimate follow-through arrives 20 days after that first up day in the market!


Still, when that happens, you can begin to buy fundamentally strong stocks that are breaking out in volume.


This isn't always an easy mechanism to follow. The follow-through day often comes amid the deepest gloom of a correction. Emotionally, investors want to forget about the market by the time it hits bottom.


When Fear Is Running Through The Streets, What To Do
----------------------------------------------------

What you should forget is the fearful voices you are hearing.


Instead, heed the follow-through signal.


On March 17, 2003, the experts quoted in the media were predicting a double-dip recession. One economist said the economy was "at the precipice of a free fall" and there was "nothing to overcome the uncertainty."


Someone forgot to tell the market not to overcome the uncertainty.


The Nasdaq notched a follow-through that same day — Day 4 of the attempted rally **(1)**. The Nasdaq rose 55% over the next 45 weeks **(2)** as a new bull market started.

**Sell Winners Like A Pro:** [Fourth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/611488/201205211612/how-to-sell-winners-like-a-pro.aspx)

Among leading stocks, many end with a fast run-up that's just too good to be true.

It's called a climax top.

You want to be ready to sell during this outlandish run, but it takes a calm mind to recognize the signs.

The climax run involves a sudden advance at a much faster rate for one or two weeks after a rise of many months. Usually it can't occur earlier than 18 weeks after a first- or second-stage breakout, or 12 weeks out of a later-stage base.

Here are the signs of a climax top:

• **Largest daily price gain:** If a stock had a run-up for many months from its original buy point and then shows the biggest one-day price increase of the entire run, watch out! This usually occurs very close to a stock's peak. Note: This is about price, not percentage.

• **Heaviest daily volume:** The ultimate top sometimes occurs on the heaviest volume day since the beginning of the advance.

• **Exhaustion gaps:** This is a gap-up in heavy volume. This is normally bullish when a stock is breaking out of a base. But it is a bearish sign when it occurs apart from a base after a long run-up.

• **An unusual spurt**: The stock will jump 25% to 50% in three weeks or less. Don't get greedy; this is not a sign to hold for more.

• **Extended to a rare degree**: A top-rated stock often becomes extended 100% or more above the 200-day moving average. This alone isn't an automatic sell. Research shows the average big winner reaches 111% above the 200-day line at the peak. The top 10 percentile of big winners, however, can reach 189% on average.

• **A too-perfect streak**: Seven of eight days are up, or sometimes the ratio is even better. Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams couldn't bat .875 for long. A stock also seldom can sustain an unreal pace.

• **Largest weekly price spread**: Like the first item, a stock is often close to a peak when this happens.

In December 2006, **China Life Insurance** ([LFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LFC)) began a run that led to a 57% gain in 12 sessions **1**. On the ninth day, the stock was 103% above its 200-day line **2**. Two days later, the stock split **3**. On Jan. 3, the stock jumped 10% in an exhaustion gap **4**. The run was over.

The process of identifying supply and demand in a stock starts by doing this: analyzing both the price and volume in [daily and weekly charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY). Making this effort helps you make intelligent decisions in when to buy growth stocks.




Are up days or weeks happening in heavy volume? Does the stock close in the upper half of the trading range, either on a daily chart or a weekly one? And on the down days, are they happening in light volume? If some are in heavy volume, does the stock close in the upper half of the trading range? These examples strengthen the [overall quality of the base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


But price action might be volatile as the base takes shape, resulting in a "wide and loose" pattern. There might be too many signs of institutional selling in the base. Both are negatives and can keep a lid on a stock's breakout.


When To Buy Growth Stocks: Spot Accumulation And Distribution Clues
-------------------------------------------------------------------


One of the most critical skills is recognizing when a base is showing more accumulation (institutional buying) than distribution (institutional selling). Weekly gains in above-average turnover generally count as accumulation weeks; above-average volume declines are distribution weeks. But don't ignore the nuances.

CLOSE




If a stock rises, say, 5% midweek but ends the week up just 0.2%, you could count it as an accumulation week, but it's not a strong example as sellers clearly sought to exit the stock.


What if the stock had been down 4% for the week but closed virtually at its high for a tiny loss?


Why A "Support Week" Is Positive
--------------------------------



Don't count it as a distribution week; buyers were around, lifting the stock off lows. William O'Neil, founder and chairman of IBD, has noted that if a stock finishes in the upper 60% of the weekly trading range and volume is above average, it can count as a "support week," similar to an accumulation week — particularly when the stock is forming the left side of a new base. Such support weeks tend to see a wide move between the week's low and high.


In 2016, **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) offered a base that showed net signs of distribution.

Monster lost only 1% in heavy weekly volume during the week ended Feb. 12, 2016 — a nice showing after being down by as much as 8.6% during the week **(1)**.


In this case, it's not a distribution week. Instead, call it a "support week" because the stock ended near its weekly high.


The prior week, however, was an unequivocal distribution week **(2)** as Monster sank 8.4% for the week and finished nearly at the low of the week's trading range. Monster dropped hard in the week ended Jan. 29 and volume shot 99% above its 10-week average **(3)**. Yet since the stock finished in the upper 60% of the week's range, you could consider it to be a support week.


Monster soared 17% during the week ended April 29, but the stock had problems making meaningful progress after that. By the time the stock tried to break out in June, Monster showed seven distribution weeks (down in price and in above average turnover) and four accumulation weeks (up in price, strong trade). The up week that ended May 13 **(4)** doesn't have the look of a true accumulation week and thus is not counted.


The overall negative count was a hint to astute traders that a breakout might not have legs.


Monster gained just 8% from a split-adjusted 51.41 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It didn't take long for sellers to gain control. Monster soon gave up its 10-week moving average and dropped 21% below the 51.41 entry.

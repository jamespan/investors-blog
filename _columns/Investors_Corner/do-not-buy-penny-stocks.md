  Investors Should Not Buy Penny Stocks

Certain things investors should never, ever do. One of them is buy penny stocks.

  

At times, investors may hear of someone making big money in a penny stock. But aside from a one-hit wonder, finding a legitimate penny stock investor with consistent profitability isn't easy. That's because penny stocks are very risky. They are much more of a gamble than other stocks.

  

Generally, penny stocks are ultralow-priced stocks of small-cap or microcap companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a penny stock as a security with a price under \$5 a share, issued by a very small company.

  

Penny stocks are dangerous because they have high volatility and low liquidity. It may be tough to find information on them, and they tend to be associated with a range of scams that promise investors huge upside profits.

  

Penny stocks are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and on OTC Markets, not on a major exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. Issuing companies quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board are subject to periodic filing with the SEC. But penny stocks on OTC Markets, which has three different tiered markets, may trade without being registered with the SEC. Many don't make regular filings of financial information or corporate events with the SEC.

  

Many times, penny stocks trade only a few thousand shares a day. Because of a lack of liquidity, there will be a big bid-to-ask spread. Investors may have a hard time unloading shares when they want to sell.

  

Newsletters often tout penny stocks as a quick way to riches. Investors have likely received mailings that XYZ Oil has the potential to quadruple within six months. Penny stocks are often hyped up on message boards and through spam email.

  

One of the biggest attractions of penny stocks is that they can trade for just a few cents a share or less. The low price allows investors to scoop up tons of shares. An investor with \$10,000 can buy 100,000 shares of a penny stock that's trading at 10 cents. A move of just a nickel would be a 50% profit.

  

But whether in the stock market or anywhere else in life, everything tends to sell for what it's worth. Prices on these microcap and small-cap stocks are low for a reason. So investors should avoid trying to make a fast buck with penny stocks. Instead, stick with stocks of firms with breakthrough products or services. Focus on those accumulated by top institutions.

  

Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission settled a case with Canadian John Babikian, who ran the penny stock picking service Awesome Penny Stocks (ASP). Investors may have recalled seeing ASP ads a few years ago on major financial websites or have received spam email from ASP.

  

Babikian was alleged to be running a pump-and-dump operation, where he'd tout penny stocks that he owned to subscribers without disclosing his position. On Feb. 23, 2012, he touted shares of coal producer America West Resources, which closed at 29 cents the day before. The stock shot up to \$1.80 intraday Feb. 23, allowing Babikian to sell more than 1.3 million shares. America West fell back to 20 cents a share about a month later.

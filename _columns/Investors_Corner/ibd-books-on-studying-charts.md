For novice investors, it's not so difficult to understand company fundamentals. But the art of chart reading befuddles many.

Fundamentals are straightforward. If sales totaled \$10 million and a year ago were \$8 million, everyone agrees that's a 25% increase. But when it comes to understanding stock charts, the subject matter is much more subjective and imprecise. That's why chart reading is harder.

Two new books from IBD provide new angles on how investors can embrace chart analysis.

"[How to Make Money in Stocks— Getting Started](https://www.investors.com/gettingstartedbook)" includes a full chapter on charts. It breaks down the art into small, easy-to-chew parts that make stock charts approachable.

"When I was starting out, charts seemed overly 'technical' to me," author Matthew Galgani, an IBD education specialist, wrote in the [book](https://www.investors.com/gettingstartedbook). "My epiphany came when I finally realized all those lines and bars aren't so mysterious after all. They actually do just one simple thing: They tell you a story."

Those stories start in a section titled "Chart Reading 101," which explains three ways to detect in a chart when institutional investors are buying shares. Another section simplifies patterns into just three basic ones and their key characteristics. The third section is a "how-to" on putting these few simple concepts to use.

Another new book takes chart reading from another angle: IBD readers themselves.

Amy Smith's "[How to Make Money in Stocks — Success Stories](https://www.investors.com/offer/splash.aspx?id=HTMMISSuccess)" explains stock investing through the eyes of IBD readers who share their successes — and failures.

In a 60-page chapter titled "Breaking Boards: Successful Trades and Lessons Learned," some of those readers describe how they learned about specific stocks and how they traded them.

These first-hand experiences serve as a unique learning tool because readers explain the process they went through as they studied stocks, and as they held shares until it was time to take profits.

Although the readers' stories are more personal narratives than chart discussions, the chapter includes a number of illustrated stock charts to help readers understand the decision-making paths each investor took.

Smith, also an education specialist at IBD and co-host of the [IBD Radio Show](https://www.investors.com/radioshow/?nav=IBDTVRadio) with Galgani, sought out the routines these investors used to find the winning stocks. In her book, you'll also find examples of how readers developed their own routines and made buy and sell decisions.

Both books are available at bookstores, at Amazon.com and other online retailers, and at the [IBD Store](https://www.investors.com/store/) at Investors.com

_Third In A Series_

Coming to a stock late in the game can be dangerous. You don't want to be the dumb money buying shares from the smart money.

Keeping track of the base count is one way to stay on the right side of a trade. Research shows that a breakout from a first- or second-stage base is more likely to work than later-stage breakouts.

This is relevant to the current market because many top stocks are late in the base count.

Occasionally, an elite stock will continue to gain ground out of third- or even fourth-stage bases. (Think **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in its run-up to its 2007 peak, or **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) from 2009 to the present.)

An investor who has profits from an early-stage breakout can hold through a later-stage base to see if it works. But that's different than opening a new position. The early investors are risking part of their gains. The late investors are risking a loss.

In most cases, you want to restrict your new buys to first- and second-stage bases.

How does the base count work?

A bear market resets the count for all stocks to zero. Every stock gets a fresh start. Each breakout with a 20% gain or more sets the stock up for the next stage.

In a bull market, a stock has another way to reset the base count. If a stock falls so much that it undercuts the low of a previous base, then the base count is reset.

What if you can't find any quality first- or second-stage bases? Is it better to buy a fundamentally strong stock that is later-stage, or is it better to buy a weaker stock that is early-stage?

In that situation, it might be better to do nothing. Both choices are low-probability stock plays.

Let the top-quality stocks reset their count. Or watch for recent initial public offerings that are low in the count, or new names benefiting from sector rotation.

A bull market must endure intermediate corrections. Declines can help reset the base count.

Sometimes the count is reset, but the stock's ratings slip. For example, farm equipment maker **John Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) and mining gear maker **Joy Global** ([JOYG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JOYG)) reset their counts. But both stocks' Composite Ratings are below 90.

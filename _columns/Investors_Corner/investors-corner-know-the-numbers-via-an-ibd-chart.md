IBD's special charts and features can help you spot great stocks of great companies. But you might occasionally feel overwhelmed by the onslaught of numbers.

  

After all, IBD's charts are chock full of data. But you really need to understand the data to get a full picture of any stock. In those numbers may be hiding the makings of a superstar.

  

When you research a stock for a potential buy, you want to make sure it's tops in fundamentals, price and volume behavior, and institutional sponsorship. The biggest winners tend to score high in all three before they launch their big price runs. Use the data found in IBD's mini-charts to systematically check each of these criteria.

  

Today we'll examine the data included in a recent IBD 50 feature. Two of these brief stories appear each week from the roster of the IBD 50, a proxy for the market's leading stocks.

  

The May 16 issue featured **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)). The mini-chart's "header" shows, in boldface, the company's name and ticker. You'll also see the stock's industry group ranking. Illumina held the No. 30 slot that day out of the list of 197 industries tracked by IBD. The lower the number, the better the rank. In general, focus on those with a No. 40 rank or better.

  

To the right, you'll see the price. You'll see that IBD 50 stocks tend to have a high price. Why? They enjoy strong institutional demand.

  

Now let's look at the fine print. In the first line below the header, you see the stock's float **1**, followed by its Composite Rating **2**, its EPS Rating **3**, its Relative Strength Rating **4** and its return on equity **5**.

  

That's a lot. Each piece of information is crucial, though. Don't just skim quickly. Stop and digest the information. Go through the Investor's Corner archives for detailed explanations on each one.

  

The next step through this tour de chart is a brief description of the company's activities **6**. What does Illumina do? "Develops integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function."

  

You may have no idea what that means. But if you're serious about the stock, you need to understand what makes a company special. Check out recent articles at IBD's archives in Investors.com.

  

Now let's go back to the numbers.

  

Look just below the dotted line. Illumina has a positive 11% annual EPS growth rate. In comparison to other winners, that may not be great. Next you'll see the stock's P/E ratio is 64, for those who care.

  

The average daily volume is almost 2 million shares. That's healthy. You know the big funds can move in and out without disrupting the price too much except, hopefully, in your favor.

  

Next, you'll see "debt 0%." That represents the long-term debt divided by shareholder equity. Zero is great, but don't let modest debt scare you away from a good firm.

  

Next, Illumina's most recent quarterly report showed a 67% EPS gain and the report prior to that showed a 38% gain. Sales in the most recent quarter rose 47%.

  

"4 Qtrs EPS \>15%" may look like a California license plate number, but actually it means that this company scored 15% or higher profit growth for four straight quarters. Its next report is due July 27. Illumina devotes 20% of its annual revenue to research and development.

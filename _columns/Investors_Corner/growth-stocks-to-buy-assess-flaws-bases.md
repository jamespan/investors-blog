Investors searching for [growth stocks to buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sp500-beating-lists-find-next-apple-amazon/) quickly discover that understanding how to read [stock charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) significantly improves results. They also find there is a steep learning curve, and climbing that curve takes some work.




In [CAN SLIM-style investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), step one requires learning to recognize the [standard bases that set up big moves in price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Investors [searching for stocks to buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sp500-beating-lists-find-next-apple-amazon/) will also find that IBD articles sometimes describe traits within bases as flaws. The term "flaw" doesn't show up either in the index of IBD founder William O'Neil's [How To Make Money In Stocks](https://www.amazon.com/Money-Stocks-Complete-Investing-System/dp/0071752110/ref=pd_sbs_14_2/131-8432349-3559851?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0071752110&pd_rd_r=3239edce-6ff6-4988-9ef2-41d452ba77c0&pd_rd_w=SjBZT&pd_rd_wg=g3uaT&pf_rd_p=1c11b7ff-9ffb-4ba6-8036-be1b0afa79bb&pf_rd_r=TVGKX1VVQRDNX08BQEXK&psc=1&refRID=TVGKX1VVQRDNX08BQEXK), or [in the IBD Key Terms glossary](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/?nav=IBDUKeyTerms) at Investors.com. (The term "faulty bases" does show up in the index of O'Neil's investing classic.)


Growth Stocks To Buy: First Find The Flaws
------------------------------------------


So what does it mean for a base to have a defect or a flaw?


To start, keep in mind that a chart is essentially a map of the actual price performance and share turnover of a stock. That map is drawn by the daily interaction of supply and demand in the largest auction marketplace in the world.

Stock charts pick up subtle vagaries in investor behavior that can hint at shareholders who are uncommitted, or ready to take small profits at a breakout, or any number of other behaviors that can lead a stock breakout to stumble.


There are many different types of flaws in bases. These can include bases that are deeper than [the usual 30% to 33% maximum decline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) desired. A base that forms predominantly below support at its 10-week line is said to be flawed.


An [upward wedging handle in a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flawed-chart-patterns-why-a-wedging-handle-is-bad-news-for-investors/), or a handle [that declines more than 12%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), or [one that forms just above the left side high point of a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) are also considered flaws. Another defect: a base that shows [wide and loose swings in price action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/avoid-the-flawed-chart-pattern-why-a-wide-swinging-stock-raises-risk/).


Do The Best Stocks To Buy Have Flaws?
-------------------------------------


All of these traits add risk to a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). A flaw or two in a base aren't necessarily deal killers. But they do signal that if the stock breaks out, that breakout faces somewhat more risk.


When sorting through charts for stocks to buy, the idea is to choose growth stocks signaling lesser risk. If an investor finds a base serving up three or more defects, they may want to review their watchlist of stocks to buy. Or, if they choose a stock flashing multiple risk signals, be aware and have their exit strategy geared accordingly.


A little higher up the learning curve, investors begin to read [accumulation and distribution in a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/). Too much distribution — meaning [an imbalance of large shareholders selling vs. buying](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/too-much-distribution-in-a-base-can-hurt-a-breakouts-chances/) — appears as a subtle early flaw in the combination of price and volume in a stock chart.


Flaws take on more weight as [growth stocks become later stage](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). A [fifth-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/) that is 38% deep, for example, is riskier than a first stage base of the same depth.


To be sure, late-stage stock bases can sometimes carry three or more defects and still produce successful breakouts and winning runs. This is the unpredictable side of market behavior, and why investors must be patient in learning to balance intuition with education and hard data as they develop their own personal approach to investing.

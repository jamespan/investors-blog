In most investors' dreams, the stock market would keep rising day after day on a nice and smooth incline. And that can occur during a strong bull market. By the same token, the market can enter a steep decline for months or even years.


Then there's everything in between, like what we saw last year: choppiness.

As unpleasant as they can sometimes be, choppy markets make up a lot of market history. So IBD readers can grow more familiar with this kind of action, this column kicks off an occasional series of articles covering on this topic. Today we revisit December 2014, a time in which the long-running bull was ready for a breather.


After an 11% slide from September to October 2014 **(1)**, the market entered its current choppy period. The S&P 500 clawed its way back to eke out a new all-time high in May, but hasn't been able to break above that level. Instead, the 500 is trading 9% off the high.


When the market is trying to find its footing, the rules of engagement don't change. Stay on the lookout for strong [follow-through days](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735761&sourceid=735764) and breakouts to new highs by sound leading stocks. This action backs up a confirmed market uptrend. Don't quit there. Continue reading market coverage in IBD and at Investors.com, and gauge the health of the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and top stocks.


Watch IBD's current market outlook closely. It appears at the top of IBD's front page under "The Big Picture" header. It will say "Confirmed uptrend," "Uptrend under pressure" or "Market in correction."


The market direction may shift often during the in-between periods from bear and bull markets. Stocks may struggle to make headway from breakouts when the market uptrend is under pressure, so it's more important than ever to lock in profits and cut losses short. Consider selling a stock when it's up 5%, 10% or 15%, and not the usual practice of holding patiently for the gain to reach 20%-25%.


During choppy markets, be quick to exit a position if a stock isn't acting too healthy. You do not need to wait for a 7%-8% loss to act. Getting out at breakeven is perfectly fine. Keeping your losses confined to 1% to 3% makes a ton of sense. Plus, you may feel it's better to wait until a confirmed uptrend to buy any stocks. That's smart. The patient investor wins in the long run.


By the time 2015 wrapped up, a shift that began late in the year was clear. The volatile market fueled a flight to safety, boosting stocks in defensive areas such as food and beverage, utilities and real estate investment trusts.


The Big Picture column in IBD's Oct. 2, 2015, edition noted: "A quick and deep dive is hard to forget. If recent history is any guide, it can lead to months of choppy action. Consider the other two instances when it happened since 2009.


"The Nasdaq plunged 15.4% over seven sessions in August 2011. The index then hacked around for more than four months before launching a tight and well-ordered uptrend.


"The Nasdaq knifed 13% lower over five sessions in May 2010. Trouble persisted for almost four months before a steady uptrend began in September 2010."

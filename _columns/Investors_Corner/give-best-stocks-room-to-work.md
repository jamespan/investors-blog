  Patience, Discipline Key For Emerging Stock Leaders

Some growth stocks are born to run. That doesn't mean they're easy to hold during market pullbacks.

  

Latching on to a potential emerging leader in the early stages of a new bull market is the goal for any growth investor. A sound entry point can result in a quick gain and, in many cases, a big profit cushion. The bigger the cushion, of course, the easier it is to hold the stock during normal market pullbacks.

  

It's never an easy call — deciding when a possible model-book stock should be held and when it should be sold during periods of market softness. A common pitfall for most investors is to sell a leader in the early stages of a move.

  

For future reference, ask yourself these questions:

  

Is it a nascent market uptrend, or have indexes made a big move already? If it's a new uptrend after a bear market and base breakouts are plentiful, the uptrend could very well have staying power.

  

Does the stock in question truly have the potential to be a model-book stock? In other words, is it a newer name with disruptive technology that's fueling big earnings growth? Or is it a more speculative, small-cap stock that's still unproven with good — but not great — fundamentals?

  

If you're holding a more speculative name, locking in a 20%-25% gain if you have it is generally sound strategy, but don't be too quick on the trigger with a 20% gain if the rally occurs in less than three weeks and you're holding an institutional-quality name.

  

**F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) showed strong earnings growth when it started a bullish move soon after the market bottomed in March 2009.

  

The data networking firm cleared a cup-shaped base in September and then quickly formed a three-weeks-tight pattern. Volume came into the stock during the week ended Oct. 2. At the time, its Composite Rating was 95 and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was A-.

  

The stock cleared a buy point of 40.03, then ended the week at 38.58, 4% below the buy point. But over the next three weeks, the stock soared 25%, giving a nice cushion for those who bought at the buy point.

  

In the week ended Oct. 30, the Nasdaq pulled back 5.1%. While a growth stock can easily correct 1.5 to 2.5 times (or more) what the broad market does, F5 only pulled back 6.9% **1**. In January, the Nasdaq slid 9.7% while F5 lost 16% **2**. F5 was behaving itself and was an easy hold for those who bought right.

  

F5 gained 264% before topping in January 2011.

  

Current innovators in the market with the potential to be model-book stocks include **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)), **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)). All three sport outstanding fundamentals with solid mutual fund sponsorship. No one knows what the future holds for each stock, but all three have key traits seen in past market winners.

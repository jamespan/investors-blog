  How To Invest: Don't Average Down And Toss Money Away

Letting losses run is bad enough, but adding dollars to a losing trade is even worse.

  

Throwing money at a losing situation is known as averaging down. The logic of averaging down is that if a stock was a good buy at \$50, it must be an even better bargain now that it is trading at \$40.

  

Don't do it. This "logic" is up against some unequivocal advice from legendary traders.

  

IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in his book "The Successful Investor:" "Don't ever average down on any stock in your portfolio. If you buy a stock at \$50 and it goes to \$45, never buy more.. . sooner or later, you will get hurt badly."

  

In "How to Trade in Stocks," Jesse Livermore wrote: "It is foolhardy to make a second trade if your first trade shows you a loss. Never average losses. Let that thought be written indelibly upon your mind."

  

In "Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard," 1997 U.S. Investing Championship winner Mark Minervini's advice is: "Remember that only losers average losers."

  

These great traders learned to listen to the market, stay flexible and follow up only on what is working. They know that when a growth stock falls below a proper buy point, it becomes a less attractive investment, not a better bargain.

  

Averaging down is the opposite of a sound pyramiding strategy, which was discussed in Friday's [IBD](http://education.investors.com/). It's throwing good money after bad, buying when you should be selling.

  

Be sure to distinguish averaging down from adding to a winning position on a pullback. Say you bought a stock at 30, and it ran to 35 before pulling back to its 10-week line near 33. Adding shares at this point is averaging up, since the stock is still 10% above your purchase price.

  

**TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)) may have tempted investors to average down earlier this year. The stock debuted in late 2011 and had been enjoying a broad uptrend, rising 122% from a breakout at 49.45 in early 2013.

  

By spring 2014, it was setting up in a fresh cup with handle, and on June 17, the stock broke out past the 104.66 buy point. Shares rallied 6% before turning lower and testing the 10-week moving average **(1)**.

  

Adding shares when a stock pulls back to its 10-week line is a sound strategy, right? Not when the stock is below your entry price. Averaging down is inviting disaster.

  

Shares did not recover, and have fallen as much as 36% below the buy point. Six months later, the stock remains trapped below its 10-week line **(2)** with a dismal Relative Price Strength Rating of 15.

  

When you start off wrong, it does not pay to add money and hope. It's time to cut losses and reassess. In fact, a close analysis of the chart could have saved some pain.

  

The stock had built a series of bases during its uptrend, and the latest was a riskier late-stage structure. The handle was wedging upward, a serious flaw.

  

The base's depth of 32% from high to low is within normal range for cups with handles; but when compared to the market index, it pointed to weakness. The base formed during a 9.7% correction in the Nasdaq. Corrections greater than two and a half times the market are prone to failure. Since TripAdvisor fell more than three times the Nasdaq, investors could have moved on and looked for better prospects.

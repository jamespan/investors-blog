**Patterns To Market Wealth:** [Sixth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/special-report/627625-patterns-to-market-wealth.aspx)


The adage "Good things come to those who wait" has been used to advertise consumer goods like Heinz ketchup and Guinness stout. In investing, it could be used for the saucer base.


Like its thick, slow-moving counterparts, the saucer base takes a long time to unfold. But its rewards can be big for those who are patient enough to wait it out.


The saucer is harder to recognize than its deeper, faster-forming cousins — the cup with handle and cup without handle.


As its name implies, the saucer base is shallow, but it can correct up to 30%, just like cup-type bases.


Some saucers can take months or even a year to form.


As a result, the base often isn't apparent on a daily chart, making it necessary to use weekly and monthly charts to spot the pattern.


Saucer bases often form when the market is moving sideways. They're also commonly formed by big- and megacap stocks, which tend to be less volatile. Like cup-type bases, saucers can also be formed by smaller stocks that tend to fluctuate less in price.


Investors should give stocks that form saucers the same scrutiny as those that form cup bases. They should possess strong fundamental and technical characteristics. One exception: Whereas top stocks should have Relative Price Strength Ratings of 85 or better at the breakout, a saucer base's RS Rating can be as low as 50 to 60. That's because the base is shallow and takes so long to form, and the RS Rating tracks 12 months' worth of price progress — or lack of it.


Ultimately, the stock should break out above its buy point — found by adding 10 cents to the high of the saucer — in volume that's 40% or more above normal.


**Novo Nordisk** ([NVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVO)), which develops drugs to treat diabetes, began forming a two-month saucer base in early December 2009 **1**. Its sales growth and EPS growth were both weaker than the typical CAN SLIM-caliber growth stock, but that's not unusual for big-cap stocks. Profit and sales growth accelerated in the quarter that the stock broke out.


It broke out above the 70.10 entry on Feb. 3, 2010, in more than double its average daily volume **2**. It hit a high of 132.88 on April 29, 2011, up 90%.

We call them international stocks or global stocks -- companies based outside the U.S. but trading on U.S. stock markets.


These companies can be leading stocks in their own right -- and should be judged by the same performance gauges of earnings and revenue growth, debt levels and margins, relative to their peers. The interaction of international economics can sometimes give them currency or home-market advantages or disadvantages that U.S.-based companies do not have.


They often, but not always, trade as American Depositary Receipts -- essentially a bundled, currency-like conversion of their home-exchange stock into shares with practical values on the NYSE or Nasdaq.


Where do you find them? Scanning international news outlets is always good exercise: Reuters, The Financial Times, The Economist, the South China Morning Post. But when you find interesting stocks via these channels, you must first determine whether they trade on U.S. markets. Then you must begin the fundamental and technical research to determine whether they are leadership-grade targets.


![IC_021816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IC_021816-1024x552.jpg)When you find international stocks on the IBD 50 list, Your Weekly Review or the Big Cap 20 list, this preliminary vetting has already been taken care of.


The current IBD 50 list, for example, includes six stocks based outside the U.S.: **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) (formerly known as Avago Technologies of Singapore), Ireland's **Icon** ([ICLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICLR)) and **Ryanair** ([RYAAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYAAY)), **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) of Hong Kong, and China's **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) and **TAL Education** ([XRS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRS)).


For an even more concentrated look at top international stocks, go to IBD’s [Global Leaders feature](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/global-leaders/) (page B10 in Thursday's IBD). At Investors.com, just go to the "Stock Lists" pull-down tab at the top of the home page and click on Global Leaders.


The location of a company headquarters can be misleading. Companies incorporated and headquartered in places like Ireland or Bermuda may have significant tax advantages over U.S.-based peers. But they may still do the bulk of their business in the U.S. -- facing similar market advantages as well as pressures and risks. This separates them by some degrees by what we usually mean when we discuss international or global stocks.


But sometimes the tax advantage combined with a focus on U.S. markets produces solid leaders. In Dec. 2012, IBD’s International Leaders column (the former name of Global Leaders) alerted investors to **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), which was well into a flat base -- its third base pattern in the past 18 months. A Jan. 2, 2013, breakout from that base at 61.20 launched a 32-month run with a gain of 331%.


**Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)), also an Ireland-based drugmaker, broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 60.30 entry point in May 2013. The International Leaders column had clued in readers about the pending base at the end of April.  Immediately following the move, International Leaders included Jazz in a report on 10-non-U.S. leaders that cleared bases that week. They included Michael Kors, New Oriental Education and **LyondellBasell** ([LYB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYB)).


Jazz nearly tripled in price, reaching as high as 176.60 by February 2014.

**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

The good times can really get rolling on Wall Street when share prices surge and stockholders get wealthier. But all good times eventually end, and institutional investors start taking profits. Excessive stock splits over a limited period of time can trigger the profit-taking.

Investors love stock splits. And why not? Holding 4,000 shares of a company just sounds better than holding 2,000 shares. The number of shares held increases, but the value does not, because the share price drops depending on the size of the split.

Consider a firm with 50 million shares outstanding, priced at 50 apiece. After a 2-for-1 split, the company will have 100 million shares outstanding, with each share at 25. The company's total market value remains the same at \$2.5 billion.

The general thought process behind a stock split is that firms believe a lower share price will attract more buyers. Retail buyers, maybe, but not necessarily institutional buyers. In fact, mutual fund managers can use the excitement created by a split as a time to sell and take profits.

Excessive stock splits often happen after a huge price advance or at the tail end of a bull market. Too many can create a flood of supply, lead to a dilution in earnings and ultimately weigh on a stock.

A stock split every few years isn't necessarily a bad thing, but two or more large splits within an 18-month time frame after a big run-up is a yellow flag.

"A stock will often reach a price top around the second or third time it splits," wrote IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

Dell, now a private company, split its stock 2-for-1 five separate times in the late 1990s when a bull market was in full effect. The first one was in December 1996. The last one came in March 1999 **(1)**. Over that time, shares surged more than 1,000%.

After its fifth stock split, Dell struggled. It made new highs during a breakout that coincided with the Nasdaq's March 2000 peak **(2)**. But on April 4, Dell triggered the 8% loss-cutting sell rule. By December, the stock lost about two-thirds of its value.

In 2004, **Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) announced three stock splits that ultimately marked the stock's top. In January, the company declared a large 3-for-1 stock split. In April, it declared a 2-for-1 split. Just seven months later, at the end of November, it announced another 2-for-1 split. Over the next 12 months after the third split, Taser lost more than 70% of its value.

**Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) topped in December 1999, just after its 4-for-1 stock split.

Excessive optimism sometimes isn't apparent on a stock's chart and requires a bit more digging. Magazine covers can often mark a stock's top. So can a company's plans to move into a grandiose, budget-busting new office headquarters.

In July 2014, **Michael Kors**' ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) founder appeared in London's Sunday Times Magazine cover story with the headline "The \$3 Billion Bag Man." The stock had recently topped at 101.04 and failed to finish a late-stage base. It's now trading near 47.

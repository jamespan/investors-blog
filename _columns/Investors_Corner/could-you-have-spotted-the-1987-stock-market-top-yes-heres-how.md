Back in 2017, market observers had chattered for many weeks, if not months, about the 30th anniversary of Black Monday.




Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, was the crash heard around the world. The Dow Jones industrial average fell a record 507 points, or 22%. The Nasdaq composite sank 46 points to 360.21, down 11.3%. Volume screamed higher on the Big Board and on the all-electronic exchange.


Due to circuit breakers built into the U.S. financial exchanges today, such a large decline on a single trading session is less likely now. Yet a careful study of the price-and-volume action in the weeks preceding that crash 30 years ago will help IBD readers today spot future bear-market declines and move quickly into cash for safety.


Why? Human nature hasn't changed. Institutional investors still move in herds. Fear is still a major driver of stock prices.

[It can take just four or five such distribution days before a bull market ends](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) and a bear market begins.


How Black Monday And The 1987 Crash Developed
---------------------------------------------


Let's study what happened in 1987. The first three months of the year were splendid; the Nasdaq jetted from 348 on Jan. 1 to 430 on March 31, up 23.6%. No wonder, then, the Nasdaq pulled back mildly the next seven weeks. It fell 8% off its 52-week peak, then resumed its climb.


But in mid-August, distribution days started to appear, beginning with a 1.1% drop to 446 in higher turnover on Aug. 18 **(1)**. In a distribution day, the index must fall at least 0.2% and volume must rise vs. the prior day. Eight sessions later, the Nasdaq slipped just 0.3%, but volume rose **(2) —** distribution day No. 2.


Watch For Negative Reversals
----------------------------


The chart shows that the overall action appeared relatively quiet. But on Sept. 1, the Nasdaq reversed from a new high to fall 0.5% in higher volume **(3)**, then scored a 2% loss in heavier turnover on Sept. 8 **(4)**, right after Labor Day. That was four distribution days in the space of 15 trading sessions.


The market had topped.


After a mini-rebound from Sept. 22 to Oct. 5, more distribution days arrived.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average acted more or less the same. It chalked up [numerous distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on Aug. 18 (-1.7%), Sept. 1 (-2%), Sept. 2 (-0.3%) and Sept. 8 (-0.6%). Then on Oct. 19, the 30-stock average collapsed. At the next day's low of 1616 on Oct. 20, the Dow had dropped 41% from its Aug. 25 peak of 2746.


The Stock Market Today
----------------------


The fourth quarter of 2018 did not produce a single "Black Monday" event, but a fierce sell-off did generate the first bear-market decline in years.


On Thursday, Oct. 4, the Nasdaq notched a heavy distribution day, as noted in [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). That gave the leading U.S. equities benchmark a [ninth distribution day in recent weeks](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bulls-stocks-bears/). Thus, the [overall market outlook changed](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).


The market has recovered nicely from its lows near Christmas of 2018. But action is choppy today. The current outlook for stocks is in between "confirmed uptrend" and "market in correction."

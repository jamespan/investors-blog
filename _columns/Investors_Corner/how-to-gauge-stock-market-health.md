The [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) acronym has a lot of exciting components, such as big earnings and sales growth, a new product or service, and solid mutual fund sponsorship. But these positive traits don't mean much if the market's in a sharp downtrend.

  

The 'M' comes last, but it's arguably the most important. It stands for "market" and plays a huge role in investing.

  

Over the next several days, Investor's Corner will focus on the importance of analyzing market health. Learning how to recognize and count [distribution days](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/734484-how-to-read-stock-market.htm) and how to track a [market that has hit a bottom](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/702061-dire-market-headlines-occur-at-market-bottoms.htm) will be addressed. By the end of the short series, you'll know when to be invested in stocks and when not to be.

  

The irony is that few investors pay attention to underlying market health when buying stocks. Why? They're told all the time that it's impossible to time the market.

  

However, decades of IBD market research proves otherwise. In March 2000, for example, when the tech bubble was bursting, IBD told readers to get off margin and raise cash. At the precise market bottoms in March 2003 and March 2009, IBD told readers that the conditions warranted a strategy to move back into stocks.

  

While it's impossible to flag the exact top and the exact bottom, the time to buy stocks is when the market tide is flowing positive. That's when fresh institutional money is coming in from the sidelines, providing the fuel for gains.

  

IBD uses a three-tiered system in [The Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) when gauging market health. A confirmed uptrend gives the green light to buy. A market uptrend under pressure is the time to be cautious due to signs of institutional selling in the major averages. A preponderance of institutional selling and numerous breakdowns in leading stocks are always enough to put the market in a correction. That's the time to get out of the market's way and stay in cash.

  

The "What's The Market Trend?" page, today on B2, showcases helpful data and large daily charts of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average. The Thursday edition updates bullish and bearish sentiment among newsletter editors polled by Investors Intelligence. It's a contrarian indicator, meaning if bullish sentiment is extremely low among newsletter writers and even lower than bearishness, a market bottom might not be far off.

  

The put/call ratio is another fear gauge. During market sell-offs, if the ratio moves well above 1.15, it indicates excessive fear, which has been noted during many market bottoms in the recent past.

  

Current market conditions are a good example of how an unsettled market can weigh on growth stocks. Major averages are still showing resilience but persistent undercurrents of institutional selling have made it a challenging environment.

  

Institutional selling isn't surprising to see, especially since the latest bull market has been running for a while. Some say it's more than six years old at this point. Others say it's close to four years old after a 20% pullback for the Nasdaq in the second half of 2011. Either way, the current bull market is looking tired, as evidenced by the recent action of breakouts. Some are working, but plenty of others aren't.

  

The 'M,' in other words, is not working in investors' favor.

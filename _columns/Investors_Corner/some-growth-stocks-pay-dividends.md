Diehard growth investors must be thinking: Why is IBD profiling income stocks when growth has always been its top priority?


Growth is still priority No. 1, but these days, even stocks that pay dividends can go on to become serious winners. The [Income Investor](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-income-investor.htm) column can help uncover these stocks.


There's nothing wrong with earning a few percentage points on the side, as long as this is a secondary consideration. Think of the dividend as just the icing on the cake.


For many other investors, income stocks are an essential part of their portfolios.


The landscape of dividend stocks has changed over the years. No longer are utilities, tobacco and other defensive issues the only ones that return cash to shareholders through dividends.


These days, companies such as chip designer **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) and even Chinese online real estate information provider **SouFun Holdings** ([SFUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFUN)) pay stockholders cash dividends.


The Income Investor normally doesn't discuss bonds (a traditional vehicle for income investors). Instead, it focuses on stocks with some growth characteristics that also pay shareholder dividends. Most of the time, these companies will have yields of at least 1% or 2%. The stocks featured often are forming a base or setting up in a secondary buy area when they are discussed.


Sometimes, the column will profile real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs). The page displays three lists — dividend leaders, utility leaders and REIT leaders — of potential income plays for investors.


One common mistake is choosing companies that pay the fattest dividend yield. But such stocks can have lackluster fundamentals. Also, understand that one bad day or week can easily wipe out a year's worth of dividends.


Another risk is that companies can lower or stop paying dividends when times are bad.


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) was featured in the July 23 edition of the Income Investor. The coffee retailing giant had solid earnings and sales growth rates for a mature big cap. It offered a 1.2% dividend yield.


At the time, the stock was in a buying range from a 65.03 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern. Starbucks would go on to form a flat base with a 74.37 buy point.


The stock broke out in the week ended Sept. 13, rising 6%. Starbucks has gone on to a 10-week win streak **(1)** .

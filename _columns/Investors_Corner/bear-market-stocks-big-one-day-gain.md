Beware the one-day wonder in the stock market. In a bear market, this involves an outlandish daily price gain in a major index. Such gains can be a trap.

With the Nasdaq now in a bear market, individual investors should have their guard up. Just look at the track record.

The nine biggest percentage gains in an index often occurred in a bear market.

In 1933, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.34% in one session — the biggest one day percentage gain ever. In 1931, the Dow jumped 14.87% in one day. The year 2001 saw the Nasdaq bolt 14.17% in a day. The infamous 1929 collapse delivered a 12.34% Dow pop in one day. In 2008, the Nasdaq surged 11.81% in a day. In 1932, the Dow rose 11.37% in a single day. The 2008 Dow raced 10.88% higher in a day. The Nasdaq in 2000 swaggered up 10.48% in one session. And in 1987, the Dow leaped 10.15% in a single bound.

Superman may be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, but a bear market is more like Clark Kent. Bold moves are seldom sustained.

## The Nine Best Gains

Let's look a little closer at the nine biggest one-day gains.

March 15, 1933: The Dow rocketed 15.34%. But in the next 12 sessions it dropped 11.5%. This big gainer is one of the few that ended well. After the 11.5% decline, the Dow advanced 101% in less than four months. One factor that might have made a positive difference: The 15%  move actually constituted a Day 4 follow-through day, giving the move legitimacy.

Oct. 6, 1931: The Dow powered 14.87% higher. In the next 17 sessions, the index chopped around, gaining and losing little. Then it spurted 18.5% in eight sessions. A 41% drop followed in the next two months.

Jan. 3, 2001: The Nasdaq drove ahead 14.17%. The index rose 10.5% in three weeks. From there, the Nasdaq dropped 44% in less than three months.

The above three cases had the most favorable outcomes after the one-day price jolt. Others weren't so lucky.

## Dead-Cat Bounce

Oct. 30, 1929: The Dow delivered a dead-cat bounce of 12.34%. This followed a 29.5% drop over the previous five sessions. The index rose the next day but then fell 30.6% on an intraday basis in less than two weeks.

Oct. 13, 2008: The Nasdaq posted an 11.81% gain. In the next session, the index rose about 3% intraday. A 31.7% drop followed over five weeks.

Sept. 21, 1932:  The Dow kept in the red after an 11.37% pop. In the next five weeks, the index lopped off 34%.

Oct. 28, 2008: The Dow spurted 10.88%. Over the next five days, the index advanced 6% in five sessions. From there, the Dow skidded 33% in about four months.

Dec. 5, 2000: A 10.48% gain for the Nasdaq. In the next four sessions, the Nasdaq added about 5%. A 46.5% loss followed in less than four months.

Oct. 21, 1987: After the flash crash wiped out 38% over two weeks, a dead cat bounce of 10.15% followed in the Dow. A rolling, channel-bound market followed for about six or seven months.

## The Takeaway

Overall, investors should not put much trust in a big one-day gain in a bear market. The big gain could be a dead-cat bounce, or just something difficult to play.

The crucial takeaway is that only one of the nine biggest one-day gainers involved a follow-through day. And that one ultimately offered the best gain.

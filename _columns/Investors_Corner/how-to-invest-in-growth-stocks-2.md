Think of penny stocks the same way you think of cheap perfume.


The fact that you could buy 100,000 shares of a 10-cent stock for \$10,000 might sound very enticing. After all, with that many shares in the portfolio, you might feel like a company insider or an institutional-class investor.


The thought that the penny stock just needs to rise another 10 cents to double in price may be like an irresistible cologne.


The truth? As you learn and master the rules of IBD-style investing, you quickly learn that a stock's share price is a function of a company's quality and growth record. In the long run, stocks with higher quality, big institutional support and strong growth will give you consistent results.


A stock that is trading at 20, 60 or 100 a share or more is attractive to fund managers across the globe. With millions of dollars to invest, each portfolio manager still needs to buy a cartload of shares of such a stock. Now, imagine what it would be like to try to build a \$50 million stake in a company whose shares trade at 20 cents each. The manager would have to accumulate 250 million shares. Few companies have that many shares outstanding, let alone a float that large.


If you spot a stock in the IBD 50 that trades at least 1 million shares a day at 40, it has \$40 million of daily turnover. This allows funds to buy and sell shares smoothly, making less of a serious intraday impact on the price.


Of course, some pros excel at buying and holding stocks that trade for less than a buck or two a share. But even for them, the road to profits is not smooth. Penny stocks are a whole lot closer to becoming financial dust if the underlying company files for bankruptcy.


Do you remember **Central European Distribution Corp**. ([CEDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEDC))? The exporter of fine wines and liquors and a vodka distiller in Poland, it was a hot rod during the 2003-to-2007 bull run. IBD frequently covered the former IBD 100 member. In July 2008, the stock traded as high as 77.48.


But after the 2008 bear market, CEDC never made a new high again. On Feb. 26 this year, the stock fell 77 cents, or 55%, to 62 cents amid a mountain of souring convertible debt.


Despite efforts to shore up its finances, CEDC kept falling until its stock was suspended from trading on April 12. On July 8, Nasdaq said it would delist shares of CEDC as well as three more companies.


Care more about the dollar size and quality of your investment, not the sheer number of shares you own.


Suppose you bought \$10,000 worth of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) when it first broke out of a first-stage base on March 4, 2004. The buy point was 24.94, the average volume was 5.7 million shares. That's solid liquidity. So what if you owned just 400 shares? Apple rose 179% to 69.57 by Nov. 29, growing your wad to \$27,900.

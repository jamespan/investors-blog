When the stock market climbs and consolidates often, many stocks form the [base on base, a bullish chart pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/). Keep an eye out for them; they tend to be strong chart formations.




The base on base is, of course, a combination of two bases. A stock forms a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) but doesn't rise in price much from the buy point. That's often because the general market comes under selling.


So, [a new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) starts taking shape at a higher elevation than the first. On a chart, the two patterns resemble the profile of two stair steps. Sometimes, the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from the second base will come after the selling pressure in the market has lifted.


5 Principles Of The Base On Base
--------------------------------


Here are five characteristics to help identify the pattern.


* The two bases can be of any proper type: [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/), [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Usually, though, the second pattern is a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).
* The second base should not encroach much into the price levels of the first. Any base that sinks much into the first base is not a [proper base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/).
* The [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is determined by the second base, whatever that is.
* When [counting bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/), a base-on-base formation counts as a single stage. For example, don't count a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) as first stage and a flat base on top of it as a second-stage base.
* If a stock climbs more than 20% from its buy point before it starts forming the second base, consider the two patterns entirely separate, *not* a [single base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/).


Advanced Energy Breakout
------------------------


To illustrate the characteristics, have a look at daily chart of **Advanced Energy Industries** ([AEIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEIS)) back in the spring and summer of 2016.


In April that year, it started a shallow consolidation that stretched to May. On May 23, Advanced Energy cleared the 35.79 buy point **(1)**. Volume was low that day, which suggested that institutional investors could take their time buying shares or pass altogether.


In two weeks after the breakout, the stock rose less than 9%. Then it started forming another shallow consolidation, one that resembled the first. Both declined about 10% and were five weeks long. More important, both were proper patterns. That gave Advanced Energy the framework of a base on base.


The stock topped the 39.03 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on July 12 **(2)**. Volume also was low, but weekly volume was 70% greater than the previous week. Shares continued climbing with minor corrections for many months.

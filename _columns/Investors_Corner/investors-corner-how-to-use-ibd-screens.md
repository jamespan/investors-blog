Thursday's Investor's Corner reviewed the computer-generated screens available at IBD's website, Investors.com.

  

Today's column provides an overview of three additional screens that appear in the print and eIBD editions: Stock Spotlight, the IBD Timesaver Table and Weekly Stocks On The Move.

  

Keep in mind that all screens have their own strengths and weaknesses. So it's smart to look at multiple screens.

  

That way, when you see a name appearing in screen after screen, you can be sure that it's a promising stock by different measures.

  

• **Stock Spotlight:** This daily feature consists of a column and a proprietary screen that selects 16 stocks whose charts appear next to the column.

  

It aims to point out stocks that are near new highs or just breaking out. The names are not just stocks that have advanced in price, but those that have many of the characteristics of past winners, such as big gains in earnings and revenue. Many longtime IBD readers have said the Stock Spotlight is one of their favorite features.

  

Back in March, the name for this feature changed to Stock Spotlight from Stocks In The News. But its focus hasn't changed in any other way. The new name is simply more in tune with what this feature is all about. After all, it was never really about stocks that were just generating headlines. 

  

• **IBD Timesaver Table:** This table aims to gave a quick snapshot of significant moves in the past trading day by top-rated stocks.

  

The left side lists the day's winners, while the right side provides the notable losers.

  

You might wonder why some of the names appear in italics or bold.

  

Well, italicized stocks have 80 or higher EPS and RS Ratings, plus they went public within the last 15 years. Boldfaced stocks also meet that 80-80 threshold, plus they gained 1 point or more, hit new highs or drew daily trade that was at least 50% higher than average.

  

You could view the table as a hint about future breakouts. Often the up stocks in the table are forming the right side of a base. Among the down stocks, some may be pulling back to their 10-week moving average, to a possible buying range.

  

• **Weekly Stocks On The Move:** This screen, which appears only in the Monday edition, also can provide hints about future breakouts, just like the Timesaver Table.

  

Stocks meeting that 80-80 threshold are in bold. To make the screen, issues must meet criteria such as heavy volume for the week and a change in price of at least half a point.

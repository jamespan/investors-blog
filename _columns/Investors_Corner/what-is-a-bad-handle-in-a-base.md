  A Bad Handle Is Bad News For The Unwary Investor

A good cup-with-handle base is a formidable launching pad for a stock. It provides safe footing in a bull market that tells the experienced investor it's likely to go higher and unlikely to go lower.

  

However, not all cup bases are good.

  

Why? Some have good handles, and some have bad ones.

  

How can you figure out if a handle was properly formed or not?

  

First, a good handle forms in the upper half of the base. We are looking to buy strength, and a handle that can't form in the upper half is demonstrating weakness.

  

You can determine the handle's position by adding the intraday high on the left side of the base to the intraday low at the bottom of the base and dividing by 2 to give you the midpoint. Do the same for the handle. The midpoint of the handle should be higher than the midpoint of the base.

  

Second, a handle should generally form above the 50-day or 10-week moving averages. It should also last more than one or two weeks. If it's shorter than five days, it's not a handle.

  

The handle should drift lower along its lows. That action shows a shakeout of the last of the frightened investors.

  

Volume should dry up, evidence that the weak holders are just about gone.

  

Before buying a stock that has carved out a cup-with-handle base, the investor should check to make sure that the handle isn't wedging up â€” that is, drifting up along the price lows. Otherwise, no final shakeout occurs. Stocks with wedging handles have a higher failure rate and often are seen in late-stage bases, the bases of laggard stocks or the bases of very active leaders that have become too widely followed.

  

If you spot a stock with an upwardly wedging handle, beware.

  

There are exceptions to these rules during volatile markets. In the 1998-99 dot-com boom, many top stocks formed bases that were too deep or too short. They made spectacular gains anyway.

  

**Maxim Integrated Products** ([MXIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXIM)) formed a bad handle in June 2004. The San Jose, Calif.-based chipmaker had decent fundamentals. Its Composite Rating was 82, its EPS Rating was 80 and its Relative Price Strength was 71. The stock was in a poorly performing industry group but had a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

It set up in a 22-week cup-with-handle base. The handle was built over three weeks. But take a close look **(1)**. Notice that the weekly lows of the handle wedge up; the lows of each of the three weeks are higher than the prior week. It's a major flaw that should give an investor pause.

  

There's another flaw. The handle is in the lower half of the base. The midpoint of the base is at 49.98. The midpoint of the handle is 49.60 (add the handle's high and low, then divide by 2). It's not obvious until you do the calculation.

  

Maxim broke out June 22 on volume that was 11% above average. The breakout failed a few days later, and the stock began a long price descent.

  

Bases without handles can be successful but have a somewhat higher failure rate. Remember, a good handle provides a final shakeout of weak holders. Once they are out, the stock is free to rise to new highs.

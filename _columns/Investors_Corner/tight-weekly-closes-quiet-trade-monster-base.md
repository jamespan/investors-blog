  Tight Weekly Closes, Quiet Trade Prefaced Monster Run

A wild run-up in a stock you own is exciting, but what you ideally want to see while the stock is [basing](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/772415-how-linkedin-started-a-big-move.htm) is just the opposite type of action. When a stock is consolidating after a pronounced advance in price, the calmer the action, the better.


Instead of wide and loose price action on big spikes in volume, look for stocks with tight weekly closes in calm, quiet trade.


"On a weekly chart, tightness is defined as small price variations from high to low for the week, with several consecutive weeks' prices closing unchanged or remarkably near the previous week's close," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


"If the base pattern has a wide spread between the week's high and low points every week, it's been constantly in the market's eye and frequently will not succeed when it breaks out," he wrote.


Tight weekly closes signal accumulation by the big money: mutual funds, pensions, banks and other institutional investors.


Let's say the market is selling off, but a leading stock on your watch list is trading tightly, with small price changes from week to week. That's a sign that some big money managers may be building a position in the stock but spreading purchases out over weeks or months, instead of causing a big price and volume spike by buying a stake at once.


If large-fund managers are dumping shares, a stock will go down in heavy volume. Likewise, if they are snapping up shares, the stock will rise in brisk turnover.


Tight trading is easier to spot in a flat base, due in part to the pattern's nature. The correction from a price high is contained within 15% from the base's peak to the trough. But it's a bullish trait that can occur in cup, cup-with-handle and double-bottom bases, too.


**Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) saw some wild and loose overall price action in 2012 and into 2013, but trading began to tighten up in subsequent bases. The stock cleared a cup-with-handle base in December 2013, and rose 19% before consolidating again.


The new pattern, which kicked off in February 2014, featured several areas of tight trading with a weekly change of less than 1%.


Shares rocketed nearly 35% in the week ended Aug. 15, triggering the eight-week hold rule for winners that rally more than 20% in three weeks or less. That week, **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) said it would take a 16.7% ownership stake in Monster as part of a deal in which Coke would transfer its energy drink portfolio to Monster.


The next week, shares fell 7.6% to start the left side of a new base. Weekly price action stayed in a fairly narrow range for the seven-week duration of the flat base, including a 1% or smaller price change for four straight weeks **(1)**.


Volume was light in the base, which is ideal. Monster cleared the 95.03 buy point Oct. 10, but heavy trade didn't kick in until the week ended Nov. 7, when the stock rallied 7% in above-average volume **(2).**


The tight trading in calm volume helped set Monster up for a big run. Shares advanced as much as 64% from the entry to its early August peak of 155.83.

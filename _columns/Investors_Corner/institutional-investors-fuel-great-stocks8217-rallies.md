If you seek to uncover the best stocks, take a look at where big investors are putting their money.

Banks, mutual funds and other institutional investors drive the stock market because they account for up to 70% of each day's trading in most market leaders. These market players represent the I in CAN SLIM — Institutional sponsorship.

The big funds have analysts to sort through reams of data. They interview CEOs to find stocks with the potential to produce the best returns. And, unlike individual investors, they've got the cash — to the tunes of millions of dollars, even billions — to boost a stock's price.

So it's key to find out whether institutional investors are showing increasing interest in a stock.

One way of doing that is by using MarketSmith, an IBD-affiliated service. The weekly chart has a table showing the number of funds owning shares in the past four quarters. A steady increase in funds, including a big increase in the most recent quarter, is a bullish sign.

Another tool is IBD's proprietary Accumulation/Distribution Rating. It analyzes a stock's price and volume movements over the past 13 weeks. A score of A or B signals strong institutional interest. A C is neutral, while a D or E points to net selling by the funds.

Let's take **Hansen Natural** ([HANS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HANS)). The marketer of Monster energy drinks broke out of an unusual double-bottom base and cleared a 51.75 buy point on Nov. 2, 2005, in four times its average daily trade **1**.

In another sign that fund sponsorship was growing rapidly, the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating jumped from D- on Sept. 30 **2** to B- in just over a month. The stock more than tripled over the next 6 months.

In addition to identifying stocks with rising institutional sponsorship, it's important to look at the quality of the funds buying shares.

IBD's Mutual Funds section identifies leading growth funds and identifies their top new buys. But a good mutual fund's rating may be lower during bear markets, when most growth stocks correct.

When a fund establishes a new position, it will typically keep adding to it, at least in the near term. But excessive fund ownership of a stock could be a sell signal; it implies the company's performance has become too well-known. **AIG** ([AIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIG)) had over 3,600 institutional owners when it plunged to 50 cents in 2008 from over \$100 in 2000.

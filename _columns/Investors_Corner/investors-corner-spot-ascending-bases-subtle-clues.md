The best stocks don't always provide an easy entry.

  

Sometimes an investor looks at the chart of a stock with ideal fundamentals and sees nothing actionable. "A long run-up with too many pullbacks," the investor says.

  

In many cases, that's true. But in other cases, the investor is looking but not seeing.

  

At first glance, the ascending base looks like something an investor shouldn't touch.

  

The pattern consists of a series of short pullbacks with higher highs and higher lows. For the investor who knows only a little about charts, the cup base and the flat base are easily recognized.

  

But a little knowledge isn't always enough. To the untrained eye, the ascending base doesn't look like a base. Because it forms amid a larger climb, the pattern is harder to spot than other bases. The action will look like ordinary pullbacks of an extended stock.

  

Here are four tips to help investors recognize this pattern:

  

First, look for ascending bases in weak or uneven markets. Those are the kind of markets that are likely to give birth to ascending bases.

  

Second, look for three pullbacks on the stock's chart, each having a higher top and a higher low than the previous pullback. Each decline should be 10% to 20% from the previous peak.

  

Third, look at the chart through a wide angle lens, so to speak. The total base typically takes nine to 16 weeks to form, which is longer than what's often seen in other bases.

  

Fourth, remember a stock must climb at least 20% from its latest buy point before the stock can form a new base. The same goes for an ascending base.

  

The buy point on an ascending base is 10 cents past the highest price level of the third pullback.

  

**Mattel** ([MAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAT)) formed an ascending base in 1967. The stock had three pullbacks, involving corrections of 18% **1**, 11% **2** and 15% **3**.

  

The toy maker broke out Sept. 6, 1967, clearing the 26.60 buy point **4** in 111% faster volume than normal. The stock advanced 102% in the next three months.

Selecting stocks that have superior profit and sales growth is not the sole key to success in the market. Neither is simply buying stocks with outstanding price strength.


Before you invest in a stock, make sure that it also is a favorite among the biggest investors in the market: mutual funds, investment advisors, banks and the like. This critical component is known as institutional sponsorship.


Proof of heavy institutional buying is one way to confirm sponsorship, but is time-consuming to find â€” except at IBD.


![COR_141110_png](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/COR_141110_png.png)The paper's Mutual Funds and ETFs section provides instruments to help. Many of the features do double duty. They reveal top-performing funds for long-term investors and help you zero in on stocks that these strong buyers have targeted.


Mutual funds are, by design, a more passive investing tool than stocks. Professional fund managers and research crews pick and time the purchases of stocks so that fund clients don't have to sweat the details.


IBD narrows down the field to a list of 40 leading funds whose stock holdings carry a high average IBD Composite Rating and which have tended to outperform the S&P 500 since the index's 2009 low.


The Growth Funds Leading The Market feature on the mutual funds page spotlights two of those funds each day. As is often the case in IBD, the feature makes it worth pulling out the reading glasses and diving into the fine print. The box provides a basic bio on the funds, a volatility rating and the average EPS and Relative Price Strength ratings of its stock holdings.


Perhaps even more importantly, the box provides the fund's 10 largest holdings, as well as its top new buys and top sells. The daily section also provides lists of other top-performing funds, screened according to various criteria.


You can delve even deeper with IBD's Mutual Fund Monthly and Quarterly Reports, usually published in the first week of each month. These features slice and dice the top-performing funds according to size, sector and type of investment. Such vital signs point to warming or cooling movement across the global economy and offer clues for whether you might want to tinker with your fund portfolio.


From a stock-buying perspective, the monthly and quarterly data on stock buys and sells are pure gold mines. These data tables put a radio collar on smart money over the prior three months. Which stocks were the top funds buying, and how much?


The "Top Funds' Latest Sells" table provides the number of funds buying vs. those selling, with a net total of sellers. If you spot one of your stocks on this list, closely monitor its chart for any key sell signals.


On the buy side, some stock names will be familiar from the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 or Your Weekly Review. The table lists the industry group name and several key IBD ratings. It details how many funds are buying and the total amount invested.


The IBD Mutual Fund Monthly special published on May 7 listed Alaska Air (NYSE:[ALK](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-alaska-air-group-inc-alk.htm)), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:[SWKS](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-skyworks-solutions-inc-swks.htm)) and Zebra Techologies (NASDAQ:[ZBRA](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-zebra-tech-corp-cl-a-zbra.htm)) as ones into which top funds poured the most dollars in the most recent three months. All three have traced solid gains this year. The Nov. 5 edition listed Celgene (NASDAQ:[CELG](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-celgene-corp-celg.htm)), Baidu (NASDAQ:[BIDU](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nasdaq-baidu-inc-ads-bidu.htm)), HCA Holdings (NYSE:[HCA](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-h-c-a-holdings-inc-hca.htm))and Allergan (NYSE:[AGN](http://research.investors.com/quotes/nyse-allergan-inc-agn.htm)).

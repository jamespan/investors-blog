If individual investors hope to succeed in the stock market, they must adjust their tactics to market conditions. A volatile market requires close attention. Profit-taking strategies must be acted upon quickly, before the gains disappear.

France-based **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) began sketching a base-on-base pattern in February. The digital ad service provider's stock cleared the 46.60 buy point May 14 **(1)**, which happened to be a follow-through day.

A follow-through confirms that a new uptrend has started in the stock market.

Investors should buy something on a follow-through day, even if it's only to test the uptrend.

Criteo was a good choice. Earnings had jumped by triple-digit percentages in five of the previous six quarters. Revenue leapt 75% to 35% in the same quarters. The relative strength line was at a new high, indicating that the stock was outperforming the S&P 500.

The market had been in a choppy pattern all year. This meant a smooth ascent was unlikely, even for a top stock.

Criteo gained about 8% in strong volume in the first three sessions after breaking out. Then it fell to 2% under the ideal buy point, but volume was soft. Next, the stock surged 10% above the buy point in above-average volume. And then it dived almost 6% under the ideal entry to test the 50-day line.

A bounce off the line and close in the upper half **(2)** pointed to institutional support.

Criteo found traction in mid-June and advanced even as the market continued its choppy action.

Criteo rose July 22 to almost 22% above the 46.60 buy point **(3**), reaching a profit-taking zone.

Given the choppy market, this was a good time to sell. Most stocks begin to consolidate after a 20% to 25% gain.

If an investor didn't sell at a 22% gain, another reason to sell developed later. Criteo was scheduled to report quarterly results Aug. 4. However, the market had reacted viciously to other companies' reports in late July.

**Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) beat on earnings and revenue but dropped 11% on July 29. **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) reported July 30, beating on earnings and revenue but plunging 14%. **Outerwall** ([OUTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OUTR)) reported July 31, beating on earnings but missing on revenue and skidding 13%.

An investor who witnessed this punishing climate could've sold Criteo for an 11% to 14% gain.

On Aug. 4, Criteo beat on revenue but missed earnings. Shares dropped 12%, wiping out all of the gain from the breakout.

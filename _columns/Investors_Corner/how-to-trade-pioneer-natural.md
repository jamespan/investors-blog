The biblical verse "Pride goes before a fall" holds especially true for investors.

  

Pride, greed, fear and other emotions can be lethal to your portfolio, especially when it comes to high-growth stocks that can rise very far, very fast — or plunge.

  

Some investors may buy too high or hold too long, expecting the stock to keep climbing, only to watch it crash. Others may buy low expecting a rebound, only to watch the stock go lower.

  

These common mistakes can be corrected by ignoring your emotions. Focus on IBD's buy and sell rules — ones that have been tested and proved for decades.

  

Investors who had taken that advice probably would have bought **Pioneer Natural Resources** ([PXD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PXD)) when it cleared its buy point in heavy volume and sold before it erased a 12% gain. It's fallen hard ever since then.

  

The oil explorer cleared the 209.84 buy point of a cup-with-handle base May 29 in volume that was 41% above average and rose nearly 12% to a high of 234.20 on June 24.

  

Then things got a bit tricky. Pioneer retreated to its 10-week moving average in light volume, a normal pullback. That was followed by a rebound to a new high of 234.60 on July 24, then a drop below the 10-week line in heavy trade in the week ended Aug. 1 **(1)**.

  

An investor who was in love with the stock may have decided to hold on, convinced it would ultimately rebound.

  

But an investor following the rules may have decided to sell, given that the stock nearly undercut its buy point as it sliced through the key support line.

  

A smart time to exit the stock came July 31, when Pioneer pierced its 50-day line in above-average turnover (please see a daily chart). Certainly, those following the rules would have sold in the week ended Sept. 26, when Pioneer fell 8% below its buy point, triggering a key sell signal.

  

In a Sept. 13, 2011, interview with MarketWatch, IBD Chairman William O'Neil said the biggest mistake the average investor makes is "not having, and following, a strict rule to always sell and cut short your losses."

  

Those who continue to hold onto Pioneer hoping it can come back are sitting on a loss of 35% more than six months after its breakout. Those who cut their losses short freed up funds to invest in another potential winner.

  

Don't get overly excited if your stock turns into a big winner. IBD recommends taking profits in stocks that rise 20% to 25% above their buy points, as most tend to correct at that point to form new bases.

  

"You'll never sell at the exact top, so don't kick yourself if a stock goes still higher after you sell," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "The object is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger."

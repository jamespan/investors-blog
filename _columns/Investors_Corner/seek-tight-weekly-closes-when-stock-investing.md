You've probably noticed that the nicest-looking stock bases are tight: Limited weekly trading ranges make for a well-defined structure. Sloppy is, well, sloppy.

Tight price trading is the unmistakable footprint of intense institutional interest. And that's often the final ingredient to a winning stock.

What's the link between tight trading and professional fund managers? Imagine a day in the life of a stock. Lots of buying and selling. A surge of buying pushes it up, while a surge of selling pushes it down.

But what if the stock withstands the selling? It barely budges. Some folks are buying, and in enough quantities to take on all comers.

Those are the big funds that are quietly accumulating shares while attracting as little attention as possible.

The result is steady support at a specific tight area. Volume likely will be low, but can be heavy too. The tightness in price becomes meaningful when it runs to a few weeks. If word gets out that a \$20 billion fund is buying a high-quality stock, it will likely soar â€” immediately, and a breakout is born. And that fund and others will either have to chase the stock or miss the boat.

But you have a question. Yes, you in the third row. You want to know who's selling enough to keep the stock from rising? Isn't tight trading a glass-half-empty-or-half-full thing?

Remember two things. First, if you're looking at a proper base, it already shows at least a 30% prior uptrend. Second, it's a base. So it should have nicely defined characteristics and a clear buy point.

If selling dominates, it won't break out on the upside, or it might do so and then fizzle. If it's the latter, just follow IBD's loss-cutting sell rules and you'll avoid the worst troubles.

Here's another clue: Look for closes at or near the highest price for the week. Again, these signs of strength within a basing period are another clue that you're on the right track.

Just as tight closes betray an institution's eagerness, so do these strong weekly closes. These managers work with parameters. They typically can't or won't go beyond a certain price.

What's that price? Probably the upper end of that week's range. And then Monday starts another week, and one of those weeks the big-money fund managers will realize they'll get no more bargains. And that's when the fun begins.

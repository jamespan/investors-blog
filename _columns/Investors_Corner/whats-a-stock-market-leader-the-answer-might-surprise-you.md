Opinions vary about what a leader looks like in the stock market.

For example, watch the financial news on TV and you’ll see a steady flow of market pundits calling **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) a leader in the chip space, or **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) a leader in the networking space.



Truth is, they are not true stock market leaders anymore. Yes, they have big, well-known brands -- and they’re still widely held by fund managers -- but both are struggling to hold onto market share as new names emerge.

IBD’s definition of a leader -- the L in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) -- is fairly straightforward. For starters, the stock needs to be showing relative price strength in the market -- going up in price, not down. Stocks near 52-week highs are leaders, not stocks near 52-week lows.

Leaders also have outstanding earnings and sales growth and are taking market share from the competition. They’re typically newer companies, although older, large-cap names can sometimes fit the bill as long as they successfully adapt to fast-changing industry conditions.

Leaders also share something else in common. Their uptrends are being fueled by institutional buying from mutual funds, banks and other institutional investors, whose buying power have the most impact on a stock’s upward move.

Daily and weekly stock screens throughout IBD cast the spotlight on leading stocks. Some are large-cap, liquid names, but the majority of screens house lesser-known, yet compelling names with leadership traits. Weekly screens include [Your Weekly Review](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/your-weekly-review/) in Friday's IBD. It lists top-rated stocks throughout IBD’s 197 industry group rankings. Every Tuesday, the Big Cap 20 presents large-cap names with leadership traits.

Daily screens include Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight, Income Investor and World Stocks.

The accompanying table highlights some emerging chip designers in the fabless semiconductor space. **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) owns the biggest market capitalization in the group at \$78 billion. It is still mentioned as a leader in the group but with an IBD Composite Rating of 59, it’s not a leader anymore.

**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) is the second-largest stock in the group. Its recent merger with Avago has stirred some excitement on Wall Street, fueling strong price performance in recent weeks. A Composite Rating of 97 points toward a stock with leadership traits.

Meanwhile, newer names with innovative new products have emerged. They include **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)), **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), **Silicon Motion Technology** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) and **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)).

Leadership also applies to industry groups and sectors. A stock may have the look of a leader, but if it’s not a member of a top-performing group or sector, meaningful gains could be tough to achieve.

Use the industry group rankings -- found every day in the print edition's B section, on the page labeled "What’s The Market Trend?" -- to keep track of leading groups in the market. Gold miners have been outperforming recently.

To find the leaders in the group, go to [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) and enter the ticker symbol for any gold stock, and you’ll immediately see who the top-five stocks are in the group based on their Composite Rating.

IBD’s stock tables, meanwhile, are all about leadership as well. The tables are arranged by sector strength to keep your attention focused on leading stocks in leading sectors.

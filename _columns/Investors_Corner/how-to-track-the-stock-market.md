Navigators who travel via map and compass know that the best way to understand where you are and where you are going is to always know where you've been.


Far too many investors believe that in order to succeed you must first correctly forecast exactly how the market will behave in the weeks or months ahead.


It's a simple misunderstanding, one that seeds lucrative ground for countless media outlets and market analysts. What is the alternative? Having a solid idea of what the market is doing right now. It is absolutely true that investing with, rather than against, the market's direction is a crucial factor of success. Most stocks follow the market's trend. This concept is so important, in fact, that it represents the M in the CAN SLIM investing program.


Knowing what the market is up to, reading its signals, and understanding how to react does not require a crystal ball. What you need is a clear answer to two questions: How did the market act today, and how has it acted in the recent past? You need to know, in effect, where you've been, in order to determine where you and your investments stand today, and to outline a course of action for tomorrow.


The good news: Maintaining such knowledge is relatively simple. These few simple steps will give you what you need to know.


**1.** Keep close tabs on IBD's daily [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) and Market Pulse (today on B2). Found in both the print IBD as well as at Investors.com, these detail the market's behavior day by day. The Big Pic explains how the day's market action fits into the larger context of recent behavior. It tracks rising distribution (unusually heavy selling by large investors) within the market and explains bullish and bearish signals. It raises such factors to prescribe a recommended buy, sell or hold approach for investors.


The Market Pulse clearly states the market's status: correction, confirmed uptrend or uptrend under pressure. It tracks distribution days on the major indexes. It also lists leaders moving up and down in volume, to give a snapshot of leading stocks that are responding to daily market action.


**2.** The Market Updates found on the Investors.com home page and at the [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/) page offer premarket and intraday views into each day's trading session. They offer detail and analysis in the event that markets make any sudden shift.


Also check out the Market Wrap video on [IBD TV](http://ibdtv.investors.com/) to get a sharp view of the major indexes. It zooms in on the price-and-volume action of the key indexes and introduces leading stocks that may be worth further study.


**3.** Subscribers to IBD's [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) know the service prominently features the daily Big Picture and Market Pulse. It also provides a Weekly Big Pic article, which summarizes the week's action. The articles also generally give investors a strategy blueprint for the coming week.


**4.** [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com) subscribers have access to the blog of W. Scott O'Neil, president of MarketSmith, portfolio manager for O'Neil companies and son of IBD founder William O'Neil. The blog provides running insight into market behavior and possible sources of action for investors.


These tools make tracking the market and understanding its signals rather quick and simple. The more difficult part — and often the more costly to ignore — is for investors to build the discipline to stick to their CAN SLIM rules and not fight the market's trend.

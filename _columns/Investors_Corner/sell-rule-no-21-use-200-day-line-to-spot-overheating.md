Overheating is never good. After all, who enjoys burnt toast or a boiling car radiator? A great stock can overheat too, and the ending can be just as bad. So, having rules on when to sell stocks can help you build hefty portfolio returns in the long run.




So, how do you spot a white-hot rally that could soon turn ice-cold? Check to see where a stock is trading in relation to its 200-day moving average.


A moving average line helps you identify the overall trend as well as support and resistance levels. Gauge the strength of a trend by scoping the distance between the stock's price and the 200-day line. The more space between the two, the stronger the existing trend.


To get a 200-day moving average, just add the latest 200 closing prices and divide by 200. Moving averages are standard on most charting platforms, including IBD Charts.


When To Sell Stocks: Watch This Factor
--------------------------------------



Once a stock gets 70% to 100% above its 200-day moving average (or 40-week line on a weekly chart), watch out — the rally may have gotten ahead of itself. Very few issues can sustain that kind of momentum. According to an internal IBD study done in the mid-1990s, leaders topped once they got on average 111% above their 200-day averages.


Keep in mind that this signal shouldn't be used in isolation. It doesn't mean that a stock will just turn around and dive.

It's rare, but some stocks stretch more than 100% above their 200-day moving averages for extended periods of time.


If you do see a stock get extended well past its 200-day line, it's best to search for other symptoms of climax-type action before deciding to sell. More signals add to the weight of the evidence that the stock is topping.

The San Francisco-based firm was also benefiting as investors switched to online trading from expensive full-service stockbrokers.


From Breakout To Peak
---------------------


The stock cleared a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in the week ended Oct. 16, 1998 **(****1)**. By early 1999, it was already more than double its 40-week line.


But by April it had developed other signs of climax action. The stock shot up seven straight sessions **(2)**, gaining nearly 60%. In the last day of the advance, the stock gapped up and had its biggest one-day point gain since the move.


Schwab reversed April 14. At its intraday high, it was up more than triple its 40-week line **(3)**. In that day's IBD, the stock boasted a 94 EPS Rating, a 99 RS and an A for Accumulation. But ratings alone don't flash sell signals.


Schwab tumbled 66% in the next six months (**4)**.

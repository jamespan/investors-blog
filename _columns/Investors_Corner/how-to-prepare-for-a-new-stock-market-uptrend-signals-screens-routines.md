During stock market corrections, it can be easy to make the mistake of ignoring the daily market action. After all, the stock market isn't going up, so what's the worst that could happen? Well, you could miss some of the next uptrend's best stocks.

History is indicative of how fast the stock market trend can change, which underscores the importance of being prepared before the market improves.

When IBD's recommended stock market exposure goes up, that means investors should increase their stock purchases after having zero to little during the correction. IBD has a [recommended exposure scale](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/) based on market conditions.

## How To Prepare For Stock Market Uptrend

First, let's illustrate how we get to a confirmed uptrend.

Look for at least one major index to attempt a bottom, ideally the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500. The first day the index closes higher counts as Day 1 of its attempted rally. On Day 4 and later, you start looking for the index to rise sharply in higher volume than the previous session.

That's [a follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/). The Nasdaq's 1.6% surge on Nov. 1 in higher volume marked a follow-through for that index.

The follow-through gives investors the green light to start buying leading stocks breaking out past correct [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Sync your trading to the stock market direction by gradually committing capital to leading stocks.

But remember, that while no market uptrend has ever begun without one, [not every follow-through succeeds](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). Each day, check [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/?intcode=qcklnks|nhpqcklnks|artpromo|2020|06|iart|na||215419&src=A00600A) for the latest market outlook.

## How To Find Leaders During Market Correction

You can find many of the next uptrend's leaders well before a follow-through happens.

One way to do this is by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. Look for stock charts in which the line is trending upward, which means the stock is outperforming the S&P.

The RS line is in all IBD Charts and [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). In addition, the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/) includes a list of top-rated stocks with lines at new highs. MarketSurge also has the ["RS Blue Line Dot" list](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/), which screens for RS lines at new highs when a stock is near a buy point or in a base.

Two useful MarketSurge lists to check once a follow-through happens are "Breaking Out Today" and "Near Pivot." The latter shows stocks nearing buy points in bases, and the other flags stocks rising past buy points during the session.

To find more stock ideas, check [Stock Market Today.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) Check [IBD Stock Lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), like [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/). These features identify bullish patterns and buy points and should be checked every day.

You have to know the market's condition in order to win at investing. You also have to know the characteristics — both fundamental and technical — of the stocks that you buy and sell.


If you're an IBD-style investor, you probably already knew that.


However, there's a third element that is often overlooked. You must know yourself.


**Know Thyself**


What sort of mistakes do you make and why? What sort of winning trades do you make and why?


There is only one path to self-awareness in investing: You must study your past trades.


Some people object to that approach: "Look, I made money on my last trade. Why should I study it? And the trade before, well, I just want to forget that loss. Besides, I don't have time. I'm too busy."


If you truly don't have time to study your past trades, perhaps you should pull out of the market entirely and begin studying your trades. It's that important.


The questions that you ask might sound like a transmogrified version of the Catholic traditional examination of conscience.


You might consider asking these questions. Did I break any sound investment rules? Did I skimp on stock research? Did I ignore some shaky fundamentals?


Check your ability to time the market correctly. Ask these questions while looking at your past trades. Did I wait for a market uptrend before buying a stock? Did I buy before the breakout?


Finally, on the selling side, consider these questions. Did I ignore the 8% sell rule? Did I refuse to take a reasonable profit? Was I shaken out of a good stock and sell too early? Did I make a false god out of my own hunches and ignore research-driven rules?


You probably will find some bad and good patterns in your trading. When you find a bad pattern, you should create a personal rule that makes the occurrence either impossible or less likely.


Here are some examples of personal rules to thwart trouble. They may or may not be useful to you.


• **Personal Rule No. 1:** After selling a stock, don't jump back in too soon. If the trade was successful, you might be too exuberant to think clearly.


If the trade failed, you might be tempted to try a revenge trade. A revenge trade involves trying to get to break even in a hurry. Anger has no place in investing.


• **Personal Rule No. 2:** Reduce exposure to the market after a great year, until you can prove you are still in sync with the market. Many people give back gains after a great year. If so, you need a rule to stop that.


• **Personal Rule No. 3:** Reduce your intake of opinions and news. Financial pundits may or may not be savvy, but the market itself is a better guide.


News is often old and already priced into the market. Gerald Loeb, the co-founder of E.F. Hutton and author of the classic "The Battle for Investment Survival," observed that you can more reliably use the market to predict the news (something good or bad is ahead) than use the news to predict the market.

The [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) and the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) are two critical [stock chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) that any investor can learn in order to make more money in growth stocks. Make sure you not only know the main parameters of each base. Get so deep in your knowledge that you'll be able to spot them within a large time frame of price-and-volume action.




Why dedicate time and effort to understanding how these bullish patterns develop? Because you'll then be able to *see both the forest and the trees*. This skill could lead to more green — in your pocket.


Top Growth Stocks Build A Good Launching Pad
--------------------------------------------


Let's consider **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)), one of the current tech leaders in the stock market and a [member of IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).


The Maryland-based specialist in high-speed fiber-optic data networking gear formed a perfect [six-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) starting in the week ended July 13, 2018. Let's summarize the key details why it displayed a level of quality on par with A5 Wagyu Kobe beef:


* Correction of 8.5% from the base's high of 27.53 to low of 25.19. The limit for a flat base: no more than 15%.
* All three down weeks showed light volume **(1)**.
* At the bottom of the base, it got buying support near [the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).
* As the base formed, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) rose sharply (see the blue line in any [IBD chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) and [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/)). That is, Ciena was beating the S&P 500 ahead of a [potential breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


How was the breakout? Marvelous.

The stock gained 4.2% in the week ended Aug. 24 in higher weekly volume than the prior week. It finished the week at 27.71, slightly above the flat-base buy point of 27.63. In a flat base, take the highest price within the base and add a dime. That's your [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The next week, Ciena gapped up big time. Management reported a 37% jump in fiscal third-quarter earnings to 48 cents a share. That snapped a six-quarter streak of sinking profits. Volume soared.


Good Bases Can Follow Flawed Ones
---------------------------------


Now, look at the weekly chart again. Notice how the flat base emerged after Ciena had built a pair of longer bases? They included a [four-month double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) **(2)** that presented a 27.20 entry. But when Ciena tried to clear that [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), volume was super-dry, a flaw. Prefer strong volume along with a sharp price move.


That mediocre double bottom followed an even longer [cup-style base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/). This base's flaw? It spent most of the time building beneath its 10-week moving average. Another issue: Ciena never cleared a 28.08 [correct entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Shares have rallied 55% from the 27.63 buy point.

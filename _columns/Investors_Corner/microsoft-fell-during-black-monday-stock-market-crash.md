Sometimes, the signal that a stock is topping doesn't come from the stock's price and volume action. The stock has topped because the market has topped.


The place to find stock topping is the price and volume action of both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. The "What's The Market Trend?" page, today on B9, will help. So will reading IBD's Big Picture (on Page B8) each day.


In some cases, the stock chart looks fine. But if the market goes into a sharp correction or a bull market, it will take down three of every four stocks in the [market](http://education.investors.com/ibd-university/451606-can-slim.aspx?nav=IBDUCourse1).


That was the case with Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987 â€” one of the worst days in market history. Some commentators at the time said that the crash seemed to come out of nowhere. But those were the commentators who weren't reading charts.


The Dow Jones industrial average, the index at the time used to track price and volume in the general market, showed five distribution days between Aug. 18 and Sept. 8. That was enough to trigger a sell signal in the general market. If you're interested in a closer look, you can find this chart, with distribution days marked, on page 214 of "How To Make Money In Stocks," fourth edition, by William O'Neil.


If that wasn't enough to convince an investor to reduce exposure to stocks, the nine days leading up to the crash were horrific, with volume swelling as the market sold off. The Friday before the crash saw the Dow fall 4.6%.


On Black Monday, the Dow dropped 22.6%, or 507.99 points.


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which had gone public in March 1986, broke out of an [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) base that October, then rocketed 259% before topping at 64.13 in May 1987 **(1)**. It formed a new cup-with-handle base and broke out Sept. 24. With an Earnings Per Share Rating of 98 and a Relative Strength Rating of 97, the stock was strong enough to tempt any growth investor.


There were reasons to be cautious. The base showed significant distribution and was third stage. Late-stage bases hold higher risk. And the stock had just split shares 2-for-1.


On the Sept. 24 breakout, volume was only 45% above average, barely acceptable. Microsoft's high on Oct. 5 coincided with the high point of a reaction rally that moved the Dow up for nine days before the final descent. Microsoft didn't make a new high for two years. It was dead money for a long time.

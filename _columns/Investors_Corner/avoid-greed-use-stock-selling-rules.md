In the 1987 classic "Wall Street," Gordon Gekko said, "Greed is good." But in reality, being greedy may not be so good.

Trying to squeeze out every last bit of gain can backfire. And as IBD Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks," "The object is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger."

Investors need to stick to sound selling rules. One way to do that is to book profits once a stock goes 20% to 25% past a proper base buy point. This is strictly a money management technique. It doesn't depend on what the stock is doing at that point.

There is no way to know if a stock will go up 20% to 25% after it breaks out. But, if it does, following this sell rule accomplishes several objectives.

First, you lock in a gain. Remember you only have a paper profit until you sell. Take the gain while you have it. Two or three such winners can make for a good year.

Just because you bought a leading stock that just broke out of a picture-perfect base in huge volume doesn't guarantee it's going to be a huge winner. More likely, investors will have a number of small losses and be rewarded with a big winner less frequently.

So, following this strategy can help investors achieve a win-loss ratio of 3-to-1.

Another reason is that some stocks will pull back and form new bases once they rise 20% to 25%. This rule will help you avoid sitting through painful corrections that can wipe out gains.

Sometimes, you need to sell when the picture is good. It's the old adage of feeding the ducks while they're quacking.

**HMS Holdings** ([HMSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HMSY)) cleared a 43.10 buy point from a cup base in the week ended Oct. 30, 2009 **1**. The stock climbed as much as 23% by early January **2** before settling into a new base.

If you have profits of 20% to 25%, take them. As in this case, HMS corrected 19% and temporarily gave back just about everything from the breakout **3**. It's smart to raise fresh capital for a new winner.

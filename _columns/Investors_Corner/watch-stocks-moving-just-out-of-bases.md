**How To Profit From MAKING MONEY:** [Seventh In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/603354/201203061545/how-to-profit-from-ibds-making-money-.aspx)

IBD's Making Money has two useful features that you just might overlook.

The two features are "Stocks Just Out Of Bases" and "IBD's Top Supply/Demand Companies."

You might not know about them since they're not displayed as prominently as other content.

"Stocks Just Out Of Bases" aims to show exactly what its title promises. This feature is a computer-generated screen that highlights a few highly rated stocks that have broken out of consolidations to new highs.

It generally runs at the start of IBD's NYSE + Nasdaq Research Tables, today on B3, but it doesn't appear in every issue.

Stocks that show up in this screen often are still in buying ranges from their recent breakouts, and some of them end up staging nice advances. In general, a stock that's already 5% past the prime entry point is extended and should not be bought.

Take market leader **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), which appeared in "Stocks Just Out Of Bases" in IBD's Jan. 3 edition.

At that point, the drug developer stood 1% past a 70.52 buy point from a flat base, meaning it was still in a buy zone. It had broken out Dec. 27, not long after the Dec. 20 follow-through day that confirmed the current market uptrend.

Alexion's volume was 24% above average on Dec. 27 â€” faster than usual, but below the 40%-or-more increase that you prefer to see with a breakout. More convincing turnover kicked in Jan. 6, as the stock followed through on its breakout in 51% higher trade than usual.

Alexion has rallied nicely since it appeared in "Stocks Just Out Of Bases." It has climbed 26% from its Jan. 2 closing price, as well as 27% from its 70.52 buy point.

Meanwhile, the "Top Supply/Demand Companies" feature puts a spotlight on highly rated stocks with unusually large trading activity relative to their supply of shares. This points to heavy demand among fund managers.

When you see a stock in this automatically generated screen, it's a sign to pay attention because a big move may be unfolding.

This feature usually appears on Thursday on the second-to-last page of IBD's Research Tables, but only if a stock meets the criteria. In Thursday's IBD on page B10, a pair of retail stocks made the grade.

Do you want to get the stock that will make the big pull? Then studying a masterpiece of the 1980s may serve you well. IBD's research of the greatest stock market winners has led to the development of the eight-week hold rule.

**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is one of a handful of huge moneymakers that justified the effort in learning how to invest in individual growth stocks. After an Oct. 17, 1986, breakout, it triggered a portfolio management rule devised by the [founder of Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), William J. O'Neil.

That rule? If a stock breaks out of a [proper base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), then rises 20% or more from the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in one, two or three weeks, don't sell. Instead, try to hold it for eight weeks.

Does it drop hard for a day or two? No matter. Sit on your hands. Study the market. Just don't sell — especially if the [IBD current outlook for stocks](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) shows a confirmed uptrend — unless the stock suffers a clear sell signal.

## The Eight-Week Hold Rule: Sitting Discipline

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICnow102119-300x161.jpg)The eight-week rule allows you to give a potential market leader a chance to really grow in price. You want that  1,000% winner, right? Hold it for two months. Then assess the chart.

The stock leads its 10-week moving average higher? Hold. Do the down weeks in price pale in comparison with its weekly gains? Sit.

A [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) may form. You might add more shares at the [next breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). In effect, you could [compound your overall gain](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) in the long run.

When Microsoft cleared its first [real IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/many-tech-ipos-can-fail-on-their-first-breakout-just-like-emc-did-in-1986/) after its spring 1986 debut, its fundamentals sparkled.

Earnings per share grew 67%, 51%, 35%, 36%, 24% and 68% vs. year-ago levels in the prior six quarters. Sales jumped at a fast clip. Return on equity in fiscal 1986, ended in June that year, hit 40.5% on virtually zero long-term debt.

Microsoft continues to hold its place as a long-term stock market leader today.

## How To Invest: Big Winners

Only a handful of leading stocks in 2019 rose 20% or more in a short period of time to justify the eight-week hold rule. **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) was among those few, producing a quick 20% gain after clearing a 74.45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a May 9, 2021, [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/).

For a period of a few years ending in 2021, IBD market writers deliberately did not write extensively about this hold rule. The reason? We had been in a long and strong bull market that has its genesis in the March 2009 bottom. In the late stages of a bull run, [taking many profits when they reach a 20%-25% gain](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) is smart portfolio management.

At the same time, at least one major index fell 20% or more in 2011 and in 2018 — the textbook definition of a bear market. These drops help refresh the stock market.

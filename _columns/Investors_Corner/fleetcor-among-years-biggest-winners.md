**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) emerged as one of this year's biggest winners. This is the story of how that occurred.


The issuer of fuel cards to trucking companies and other commercial-vehicle fleets has more than doubled in 2013, far outpacing the S&P 500's rise for the year.


As with other market winners, FleetCor's success began with great fundamentals. Profit growth has been robust and steady, ranging from 30% to 50% over the past seven quarters.


Revenue growth has been similarly impressive.


Pretax profit margin topped 50% the past two years.


FleetCor issues fuel cards that allow commercial fleet companies to track spending and cut costs while also reducing fraudulent fuel charges. Its growth has been fueled by acquisitions and expansion into Brazil and other countries.


Also, like fellow credit card stocks **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), FleetCor is benefiting from a global shift away from cash to credit and debit cards. All three stocks are leaders in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor industry group, which has been highly ranked for much of the year.


FleetCor's outstanding 2013 run actually began in 2012. The stock cleared the 41.40 buy point in a cup-without-handle base Aug. 15 in heavy volume.


The stock started this year seeming to be overheating when it surged 10% the week of Feb. 8.


Yet, FleetCor continued its advance. The stock formed a three-weeks-tight pattern, which it cleared on March 22 in huge volume **(1)**. Its Earnings Per Share Rating was a best-possible 99 at the time, and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was A-.


On July 28, FleetCor cleared an 89.85 buy point in a flat base **(2)**. Then, about a month later, it climbed above a 100.97 three-weeks-tight entry **(3)**.


In early October it briefly erased its gain from the 100.97 entry, piercing its 50-day line in heavy volume. Investors who had big profits on the stock could have taken that as a cue to sell. But the stock soon recovered and was again hitting new highs.


That hiccup was about the only difficult period for FleetCor in 2013, making it not just one of the year's winners but also one of the easiest leading stocks to own.


Currently, FleetCor is forming an irregular ascending base. The ascending base would be, however, a riskier third-stage base.

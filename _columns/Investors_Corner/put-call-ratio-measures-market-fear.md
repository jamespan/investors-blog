In the stock market, it's best to be contrarian. The savvy investor hunkers down when the crowd is giddy with greed and sees opportunity when everyone else is petrified with panic.


When everyone is scared, they're out of the market. Cash is on the sidelines, ready to be deployed when the market turns up. When optimism reigns, nearly all investable funds are in. The market runs low on buyers.


One way to gauge market sentiment is to check the put-call ratio, which is calculated as the volume of put options traded on a given day divided by total calls.


The put-call ratio tracks the mood of the options crowd. Options investors typically buy puts if they think a stock will decline and calls if they think it will rise. If they're buying lots of puts, they see the market declining. And if they're loading up on calls, they're generally bullish.


The put-call ratio is published each day on IBD's "What's The Market Trend?" page (today on B8) along with a graph showing the last six months of data.


The numbers from which it is calculated can be found in the options table on the stock options page, today on A17.


The put-call ratio has a significant advantage: It measures what traders do, not what they say.


It matters most when readings are at extremes. A bottom might be in the offing if the reading spikes to 1.2 or more. A top may be in the near future if readings run 0.6 or less.


The ratio does a better job calling bottoms than tops. That's generally true of most psychological indicators because fear grips investors instantly, while greed gnaws slowly on the psyche.


What's considered extreme changes over time. In the great bull market of the 1990s, it rarely went above 1.0, a level IBD then considered a bullish extreme. A more nervous mood exists today.


See how the put-call ratio worked during a correction in summer 2011. The S&P 500 was already sputtering when it fell nearly 23% in a two-week period.


As July turned to August, the put-call ratio rose with regular readings above 1.0. It hit a high of 1.4 on Aug. 8 **(1)**, a day when the S&P 500 fell 7% in furious volume. The next day, stocks reversed higher. The 500 undercut the August low in early October, then the bull market resumed.


Don't use the put-call ratio as a prime indicator of market direction. Focus on interpreting the interaction of price and volume of the indexes and leading stocks.

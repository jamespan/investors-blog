  Will A Breakout Work? Check The Time Spent Under The 10-Week Line

When a stock is living under its 10-week moving average, it's sort of like a down-and-out guy living under a bridge. However understandable the reasons for the misfortune might be, it's unlikely the next move is to Beverly Hills.


IBD-style investors look at the stock living under the 10-week line the same way. The stock may go ahead and complete a base, but a breakout is unlikely to go far. Unlikely is the key word. There's a minority of situations where the breakout works.


How should a disciplined investor play or not play a stock living under the 10-week line? The general bias is not to play such a stock, but the investor should be aware of mitigating factors, such as the fundamentals.


Under IBD rules, a stock is bought on the fundamentals and the chart action. Knowing where both stand is important.


Construction aggregates provider **Vulcan Materials** ([VMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMC)) makes for an interesting case study. The outcome isn't clear yet on the current pattern, but the three previous consolidations are done deals.


**The first base:** In September 2015, Vulcan began shaping a base. At the time, the two most recent quarters showed a net loss of 16 cents a share and an earnings jump of 76%. That's not good enough. As William O'Neil points out in "How to Make Money In Stocks," a turnaround stock should have at least "two straight quarters of sharp earnings recovery."


Also, Vulcan's weekly chart showed a seven-week base with four weeks of living under the 10-week line.


Result: The stock broke out in unacceptably low volume and rose 4% before failing.


**Second base:** In November 2015, Vulcan began to consolidate. By the time the stock broke out in April 2016, Vulcan's most recent two quarters showed earnings growth of 139% and then 26 cents a share vs. a year ago loss. That was acceptable.


What about the chart? Vulcan spent eight of the base's 18 weeks under the 10-week line — not good.


Result: The April 2016 breakout was in light volume, but volume kicked in May 3, when the stock was still in the 5% buy zone. A buy at the 111.70 open led to a gain of about 14%. But getting most of that gain would've been tough.


**Third base:** The pattern spanned July to November. Recent quarterly EPS growth was 38% and then 10%. Vulcan closed under the 10-week line in 12 of the 15 weeks.


Result: The stock rose about 9% post-breakout and then failed.


**The current base:** Vulcan has spent only three weeks under the 10-week line. Q4 results will be released Feb. 7. The cement group is expected to benefit from a Trump presidency.
The Trump factor and the basing above the 10-week line might make the next breakout more lucrative.

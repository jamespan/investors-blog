The hype in some big new IPOs in recent years continues to be huge. But so far, the returns are not. The lesson for savvy growth stock investors and short-term traders in IPO stocks? Steer clear of the initial frenzy.




The better strategy? Use [stock charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) to determine the true level of [supply vs. demand](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/supply-demand/). Wait for a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) to emerge. Then only begin new buys at the [right entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) — that is, when really strong institutional demand kicks in.


Just as you would buy a blue chip that is reinventing itself, buy shares in the newest IPO stocks only when they stage a [great breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


The Lesson From Snap
--------------------


Two years ago, "camera company" and social media firm **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) made a nice two-day pop after pricing an initial public offering of shares at 17 each. On March 2, 2017, shares finished their NYSE debut at 24.48, up 44% from its IPO. Snap then gushed to a new high of 29.44 the next session.


But over the next 21 months, the ride was a toboggan down in price.


Wall Street has been sorely disappointed by slowing growth in active users and shocked by huge net losses. In the third quarter of 2018, Snap posted a net loss of 12 cents a share despite growing revenue 43% to \$298 million.


In Q4, revenue growth decelerated, up 36% to \$389.8 million, but Snap cut its net loss to 4 cents a share. That marks Snap's smallest net loss per share in its history as a public company.



Snap shares have rebounded sharply so far in 2019 and finished Thursday's session at 11.66, up 112% year to date. Yet Snap still lies more than 60% below that 29.44 all-time peak.


Will **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)), which priced its IPO at \$72 per share, take a similar trajectory?


On its March 29 Nasdaq debut, the stock popped nicely, hitting a session peak of 88.60. But then it began nose-diving in the afternoon that day.


Lyft has shifted gears into reverse ever since. On Thursday, it ended at 58.36, down 19% from the initial public offering price and 34% off its all-time high.


The First Risk With IPO Stocks
------------------------------



New investors may want a piece of the action fast. After all, it's a brand-new force in the ever-evolving age of the internet, thus satisfying the N ("something New") in IBD's [seven-factor CAN SLIM investment paradigm](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), right?


Yet no matter what is the next highly touted IPO, always take a watch-and-see approach. Refuse to buy a single share until a new stock produces a solid first-stage base. Let every new stock market debutante first establish some sort of price range in the open market, in front of millions of investors.


Anything can happen. So it's sensible to let the marketplace sort things out.


The first few weeks or months of action gives you a real vantage point. If the stock jumps above that price range, then you know that demand among fund managers is real and growing.


A [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) that offers higher reward and lower risk emerges. And ideally that price range should not be wide, such as 40% or 50% from low to high. Prefer those stocks that form a much shallower price range.


If the stock drops to the lows of that initial price range, or even cuts below it, you also know that the readily available supply of shares is much greater than demand.


This is exactly what happened with Snap on May 11, 2017. Shares collapsed 21% in huge turnover. Pension funds, endowments, hedge funds and mutual funds stepped away from the stock, not rushing to grab a stake. (You can see a historical daily, weekly or monthly chart of Snap at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).)


How To Invest In IPO Stocks: Rules Based On Research
----------------------------------------------------


Decades of research by IBD has found that a few big winners can form a superb initial base that is much smaller in length than the typical winning chart patterns discussed in [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/) and throughout the market and news coverage at Investors.com. While a cup base must be at least six weeks long, an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) can form in as little as four weeks or even less.


Michael Kors (now known as **Capri** ([CPRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRI))) public on Dec. 15, 2011, at 20 a share. Then the stock took just 13 days from Dec. 23, 2011, to Jan. 11, 2012, to form a very [narrow IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) that saw only a 7.5% decline from high (27.58) to low (25.50).



The fashion accessories maker and store operator broke out on Jan. 17 with gusto, rising nearly 6% and swiftly jetting past the 27.68 IPO base buy point. It ran up to as high as 50.69 by March 9, 2012.


However, not all IPO breakouts will work out that way. Indeed, a true growth stock investor cannot achieve excellence without executing great sell rules, no matter if a stock is on the way up or on the way down.


If you seek investing greatness, learn this new sell rule that will help you get the most out of new IPOs. It's simply called the eight-week rule, showcased in IBD's home study program, [IPO Trading Strategies](https://www.investors.com/product/home-study-kit-ipo-trading-strategies/). (*Please see "Home Study Programs" at the [IBD Store](https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/) at Investors.com. It includes two DVDs of proprietary content that integrates audio commentary from Mike Webster, a portfolio manager at IBD sister firm O'Neil Capital Management, with in-depth chart annotations.)*


This rule, the product of new IBD research, is simple to follow. You need both [daily and weekly charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) to use it.


Suppose the market is in a confirmed uptrend, and you buy a brand-new stock as it bursts out of its initial base. It rises. A string of up weeks tells you that institutional investors are rushing to grab shares. All good. Now apply the eight-week rule. Hold the stock until eight weeks have passed since the breakout day. Then study a weekly stock chart carefully.


Has the stock risen at least 5% to 10%? Does it hold above the 10-week moving average? And is the market still healthy? If the stock passes these tests, continue to hold your shares or sell a portion. Then study the action on a week-to-week basis.


Sell only when the stock sharply undercuts its 10-week moving average, typically in above-average volume. And don't ever let the stock's gain turn into a loss.


IPO Stocks: Why This China Play Was A Stock Market Winner
---------------------------------------------------------



In November 2006, **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) blasted out of a seven-week initial base at 28.41. That price was 89% above the initial public offering at 15 a share. Its RS line shot to a new high. The Chinese school and test-center operator proved the paradoxical truth that a strong growth stock tends to get stronger.


![IC_edu_022317](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IC_edu_022317.png)


The IPO base was pristine. It had three down-weeks in price; just one week showed heavy volume **(1)**, and it was, in fact, a support week. New Oriental bounced off its low, signaling a burst of buying by mutual funds, banks and the like.


Eight weeks into the run, New Oriental finished the week at 33.54, up 18%. Ten weeks after the breakout, New Oriental was up 39% past the proper entry. It also reversed lower and closed below the 10-week line **(2)**, but it wasn't a decisive break.


You could have held on.


A true break of the line came in the week ended July 27. New Oriental fell 14% that week; volume exploded 187% above average **(3)**. It was a great time to sell. New Oriental went on to form another base, setting up a new [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

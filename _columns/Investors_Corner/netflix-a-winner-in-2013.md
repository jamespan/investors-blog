Some of the top stocks of 2013 have been relatively obscure names. Not **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).


The company that started renting DVDs by mail has developed into the biggest name in streaming video. It also has worked its way into game consoles as the go-to name for on-demand movies and TV shows. In 2013, it reached a new plateau when it launched original shows. An Emmy nomination helped legitimize the company's bold strategy.


The success of Netflix in 2013 arose from its failure in 2011. That year, Netflix lost as much as 80% of its stock market value after unpopular price hikes and other strategic blunders hurt the company.


"Netflix Could Be The Next AOL, Palm," read a headline in IBD in October 2011, alluding to iconic tech brands that got wiped out.


Netflix's 2013 revival can be traced to the week of Jan. 25 **(1)**, when shares skyrocketed 71% after a bullish quarterly earnings report and outlook. For CAN SLIM investors, the stock was too extended to contemplate buying shares at that time.


But Netflix formed a base from late February until a breakout on April 23 **(2)** that followed another strong quarterly report.


The company's bullish forecast three months earlier had materialized, as Netflix earned 31 cents a share vs. a year-ago loss of 8 cents. A streak of five quarters of nose-diving profits had ended.


Price and volume surged past resistance at 197, and this time investors had the advantage of buying off a sound base.


Shares climbed 26% until they started a new base in May.


The breakout occurred July 12, **(3)** about two weeks before Netflix posted a 345% surge in earnings and 20% higher sales for Q2.


The stock sailed past a 248.95 buy point in heavy volume. Days later it dipped below the entry but never set off a sell rule. Indeed, Netflix resumed climbing.


Its ascent since then has been steady, save for a bearish reversal on the third-quarter results. Investors were rattled, even as profit quadrupled.


Superior stocks can overcome serious setbacks such as that.


The stock recovered and began shaping a cup-with-handle base, although irregular in shape.


Netflix is breaking out from it, albeit tentatively.

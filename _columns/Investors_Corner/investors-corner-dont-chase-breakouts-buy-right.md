You aren't always paying attention to the market. And even when you are, it's inevitable that you will miss a few breakouts.

The temptation to chase a runaway leader can be great. Resist. Research shows your portfolio is best served by keeping your purchases within 5% of the stock's buy point.

Look at the problems you build for yourself by paying up 10%, 15%, even 20% above the proper trigger.

First, you know that not all breakouts work. At some point, you're paying up after a flood of investors have already jumped on the stock.

Also, by paying even 10% above the buy point, you are exposing yourself to a quandary. What happens if the stock turns around and falls 8%? It will be just above the original buy point, which is where you wanted to buy it in the first place. But now, instead of trying to buy, you have to sell. Unless of course, you want to ignore the 8% sell rule — which, of course, you should never do. Ever.

An improper entry damages your risk-reward ratio. Let's say the breakout price for your stock is exactly 100, and that's where you get it. You're risking no more than 8%, or eight dollars per share. Conservatively speaking, your reward should be 120 or 125 — 20% or 25% from the buy point. Your risk-reward ratio is 2.5-to-1 or 3-to-1.

Now, what happens to that ratio if you pay 110 for that stock? Using the 8% protection rule, you are risking a decline to 101.20, or 8.80 per share. The target, 120 or 125, remains the same. You can only make \$10 or \$15 per share. Your risk-reward ratio is less than 2-to-1.

Have a look at the base-on-base pattern built by **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) from April 2009 through January 2010.

The first base, a five-month cup with handle, pushed past its 48.30 buy point on Oct. 15 **1**. The stock climbed as high as 61 over the ensuing few weeks, a 26% gain from its trigger. Maybe you missed it.

Did you chase Netflix up to 55? Hopefully not. After rising to 61.65, the stock backtracked as low as 48.52, virtually retesting its original buy point. If you had entered the position correctly, at 48.30, you'd have been fine. But at 55, you would have been forced to unload at 50.60, for a maximum 8% loss.

Netflix continued to build the base-on-base pattern, with a second breakout in late January **2**. That was the start of a great run.

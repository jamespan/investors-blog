Before you travel a long way, you make a checklist of what to do. You pack clothes. Ask your neighbor to collect your mail. Lock all the doors. Then finally you go. By checking everything off your "to do" list, you eliminate many unnecessary bumps along the way.




Adopt a similar mindset when you prepare an enjoyable and profitable "investing trip" with a growth stock.


With IBD's research tools, you can quickly build a watch list of potential market stars. But your work doesn't end there. To raise the probability of notching a 20% winner here and a 200% screamer there, you need to devote time to identifying those stocks that already show signs of strength.


A [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) serves at least two vital functions. One, it marks the beginning of a resting phase for a stock that has already moved sharply higher. This rest period can last as little as four weeks or as long as 65 weeks or even longer. The base gives big investors a chance to pick up shares as others unload their shares to cash in gains.

When Looking For Great Stocks Building A Base, Analyze These Elements
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Whether you're a brand-new IBD reader or a veteran [CAN SLIM stock hunter](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), you can always benefit from this checklist to help you sort among your stock candidates and increase your profit potential.


* Did the stock make a run-up of at least 30% before beginning its base? You want to see evidence of a stock's ability to rally with vigor before you invest your hard-earned cash. If a stock has already broken out of a first base, it needs to gain at least 20% before settling into a new pattern.
* Does the base meet the minimum required length of time? A flat base needs at least five weeks, a cup six weeks, a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) or double bottom seven weeks. Long cups and saucers can form over a year or longer.
* If there is a handle, did it form in the upper half of the base? Use the midpoint test. Add the highest price within the handle to the lowest price and divide by two. Find the midpoint for the base. The handle's midpoint should be higher.
* Are there signs of accumulation? Did the cup base form smoothly? Was the depth of the cup within limits?


Look for weeks in which shares rose in heavy volume. On a daily chart, gap-ups in strong volume are a plus. A cup should in most cases show a decline of no more than 33% to 35%.


 [Flat bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) and [rare square boxes](https://www.investors.com/research/chart-reading-basics-why-the-flat-base-square-box-show-bullish-action/) have a dip of less than 15%.

**Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) passed this checklist in the early 1990s. From March 1987 through part of 1989, the young biotech's stock moved like a sitting duck. But from August 1989, the stock ramped up 61% from 37.50 to 60.25 (before a 2-for-1 split in August 1990).


It faded in November, starting a 16-week [double bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). It fell 29% from the base's high to low. So far, so good.


Amgen rallied past its 55.60 buy point (pre-split) in February **(1)**, then formed a handle. The handle wasn't perfect, but volume was dry as sand. The stock also held up near its high. The time to buy: when Amgen eclipsed the handle's high of 59.50 the week ended March 16, 1990 **(2)**. It boasted a 94 EPS Rating and an 89 RS.


The stock gained 113% by year's end.

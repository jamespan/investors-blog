  Stock Sector Count Can Identify Pockets Of Strength

Staying on top of the stock market involves more than knowing whether the stocks in your portfolio are rising or falling.


What else is there to check? How about a sector count of the IBD 50?


The IBD 50 is a [computer-generated list](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of the stocks with the strongest fundamentals and technicals. Breaking down the IBD 50 with a sector count can give you an idea of where the strength resides in the stock market.


In the list published in IBD Weekly for the week of June 13, the sector breakdown looked like this: Nine stocks from the medical sector; six in software; five each in retail, building and chips; and three for internet. Other sectors involved only one or two stocks.


The first question we might ask is this: How does this compare with the IBD 50 lineup at the start of the year?


At the end of 2015, there were eight medical stocks; six from the software sector; five in finance; four each in retail and business services; and three each from banks and chips.


At first glance, there appear to be similarities. The medical, software, retail and chip counts stayed about the same.


However, we need to ask a second question: Has rotation occurred *within* the sector?


The medical sector shows the biggest change, despite an essentially unchanged count. For example, at the end of 2015, the biotechs were well into a downward trend. Former leaders such as **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) and **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) peaked in the first half of 2015. By the end of 2015, only three biotechs were in the IBD 50. And in the recent IBD 50, two biotechs made the list, but they were not the big winners of the previous up cycle. The two stocks are **Medivation** ([MDVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDVN)) and **Emergent BioSolutions** ([EBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBS)).


Could they be leaders of a biotech rebound? Possible but unlikely: Only four biotechs have a Composite Rating of 90 or better -- the two mentioned above, along with **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)) and **Ligand Pharmaceuticals** ([LGND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGND)) .


Software stocks have been a steady story. Four software stocks in the IBD 50 at the end of 2015 are still in the list. In the building sector, only one stock made the IBD 50 at the end of 2015. Now there are five, but none of them are homebuilders.


Retail is a mix of fresh names and old names. **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)) and **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) were in the IBD 50 at the end of the year and are in it now. Two stocks left the list -- **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)).


Alibaba has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 65, meaning that a hefty 35% of the market is outperforming the China-based stock. Also, earnings growth decelerated over the past three quarters, and the Street has revised annual earnings lower for this year and next.


Starbucks also has struggled since departing the IBD 50. The RS Rating is a miserable 37. Annual earnings revisions, however, are upward. Quarterly earnings growth has been steady, though revenue growth has stepped down.


The other current retail stocks in the IBD 50 are **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) and **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)).


Sometimes a sector check won't lead to many big conclusions. Aside from the rotation in the medical sector and the increase in the building sector, the changes appear minimal.

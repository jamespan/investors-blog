Rules are important, if you want to increase your odds of success.

Let's look at some recent three-weeks-tights, and the related rules.

The three-weeks-tight pattern involves three weekly closes each within roughly 1% of the adjacent week. The buy point is the high of the pattern, plus 10 cents. Generally, the trading range is tight and the volume is quiet. The pattern points to institutional support.

The three-weeks-tight is a secondary pattern. It's often a way to add shares when a stock you bought earlier in a proper breakout is working.

In the first three months of 2011, IBD identified 28 three-weeks-tight patterns. Of the 28, nine led to successful breakouts, 12 failed after clearing the buy point, and seven never cleared the buy point.

Now let's look at the rules:

• **Don't buy before a breakout:** Some investors think they can get a head start by buying a stock as soon as it forms a three-weeks-tight pattern. But the stock has to clear the buy point in strong volume to validate the pattern. Of the seven stocks that never cleared the buy point, five rolled over and declined 9% to 33%. One declined to the 50-day moving average, providing a different kind of secondary entry. The other stock moved sideways, etching a flat base, which eventually led to a successful breakout.

• **Don't buy if volume is subpar:** Three of the 28 three-weeks-tights cleared the buy point in volume that wasn't 40% above average — the minimum for a valid breakout. All three failed.

• **Be wary of thin stocks:** Many disciplined investors will avoid buying thin stocks. Others will limit them to a small part of their portfolio. Seven thinly traded three-weeks-tights broke out. Four worked, and three failed.

• **Don't buy during a correction:** The general market should be in a confirmed uptrend. Stocks can be bought with an uptrend under pressure, but this is riskier than an unencumbered uptrend.

Of the nine three-weeks-tights that worked, seven broke out during a confirmed uptrend and two with the uptrend under pressure.

In the week ended Dec. 31, 2010, **Rockwell Automation** ([ROK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROK)) completed a three-weeks-tight **1**. On Jan. 3, Rockwell broke out **2**. After some sideways action, the stock advanced 33% in three months.

When professional racing pilot Kirby Chambliss is shooting across the sky, aiming to win a Red Bull Air Race in his Zivko Edge 540, there's just one thought crossing his mind: how to go fast and win.

"I'm asked all the time, 'What do you think about when you're racing?' " the 2004 and 2006 winner of the [Red Bull Air Race World Series](http://www.redbullairrace.com/en_US/event/san-diego), which wrapped up in Indianapolis this past weekend, told IBD in an interview in 2017.

"Do you think about your family, your daughter? All I have time for is to think how to get from gate to gate in the least amount of time possible," Chambliss added.

When you're maneuvering an acrobatic plane that can speed more than 225 miles an hour and do a 520-degree roll in less than 1 second (the F-16 fighter jet can only roll 240 degrees in the same time frame), Chambliss must indeed keep a clear head.

When fractions of a second can decide who gets to stand on the medals podium, a champion must maintain 100% focus on the job at hand.

Other keys to success as a racing pilot?

The 57-year-old former test pilot at Zivko Aeronatics from Corpus Christi, Texas, tries to focus on three tasks. One, fly very well. Two, maintain a very good team. And three, have a great plane.

He keeps risk at a minimum at all times.

"I'm an adrenaline junkie, but everything is balanced with experience," said Chambliss, who has also put in 17,000 hours of flying time at **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) as a commercial pilot. "We always have calculated out the risk. I don't go out and do dumb things."

## Winning In Growth Stocks: Be Right In This Way

Growth-minded investors need to think the same in order to make the same sort of strides in their own portfolios. Stay focused. Keep things simple. And never let your losing stocks run for long. Cut those losses short.

As IBD's [Investor's Corner column](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/) has taught over the years, focusing your stock buys on just a handful of the very best companies is one of the keys to real success in the stock market. Don't own 25 or 30 names. Never own more than six to eight names when the market is in a sound uptrend. When you're right, be right big.

You might have several trading or investing accounts. It's totally fine if you want to generate income from dividend-paying stocks. In fact, that's the mission of [The Income Investor column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/). You can find companies that have a better dividend yield than the S&P 500, have excellent earnings, and have to potential to climb substantially in price. Perhaps one of those accounts can be your "Growth + Income" engine.

But after you've learned the IBD method of picking growth stocks, devote at least one account to those stocks that meet IBD's [seven-point selection criteria](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Use IBD's screens and features in the [IBD Research section](http://research.investors.com/) and [Stock Lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) to find those true game changers, not only in the market but in the economy. You want only those companies that have double- or triple-digit increases in earnings and sales, the best return on equity and profit margins in the industry, and products and services that are truly transforming business and our way of life.

## Don't Fret About Operating Errors

Finally, expect to make mistakes. Losses are a part of the investing game.

"Sometimes it's very frustrating," Chambliss said. He's referring to times when he will invest money in trying to improve his aircraft in the hopes of getting more speed and efficiency out of his aircraft. "You find out that instead of getting it a knot faster, it's a knot slower. You just spent \$50,000, but you have to throw it in the garbage."

In San Diego, racers performed two laps over the bay on a course featuring 15 gates, including a tight 180-degree turn at one end and a "Vertical Turning Maneuver" on the other end. Tight narrow spaces, or chicanes, demand extreme concentration, skill, and knowledge of one's plane.

Although the track may look simple, "it means the pilots will have to fly it absolutely perfectly if they are to win. One small mistake will see them out of the running," race director Steve Jones said as quoted in a story at RedBullAirRace.com. Coastal fog and changing winds will also challenge every pilot.

## The One Constant On Wall Street

In the stock market, things are no different. Market conditions continually change. One week, the major indexes appear to be gliding higher. The next week, they get pounded by a barrage of heavy institutional selling.

So let the daily [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) and the accompanying Market Pulse table give you a reading on the market skies every day. Only invest aggressively when there are few clouds and skies, and you see excellent breakout opportunities from true market leaders.

_A version of this article was first published on April 13, 2017. Chambliss finished fourth overall in the 2017 standings following the final race of the season in Indianapolis.

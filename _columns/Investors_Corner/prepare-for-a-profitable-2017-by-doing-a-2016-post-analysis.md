History tends to repeat itself, so your first action to make money in 2017 is to look back at 2016's trades.

2016 was certainly a volatile year. Stocks were challenged multiple times by global and domestic geopolitical crises. Despite the volatility, the Nasdaq is looking to close out the year strong around all-time highs.

An honest, thorough post-analysis is a great opportunity to review your previous year's stock trades with the purpose of discovering potential flaws and improving your investing skills. Investors of all disciplines can learn by contrasting the good calls — big winners you identified early and entered correctly — against those where you made the wrong move or missed taking action at all.

IBD founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil created his "Up 20% In 3 Weeks" rule from his own post-analysis. A stock he owned went up 20% in a short period of time, pulled back and shook him out, before rebounding and rallying substantially higher.

In his eyes, the biggest mistake was identifying a big winner and then messing up the trade. In response, the native Oklahoman created this rule to prevent him from getting shaken out of a potential big winner in the future.

When you analyze your trades, you want to focus on the biggest winners and the biggest losers in your portfolio. Perhaps there is a common attribute that your losers share that you can identify and mitigate. If you can eliminate a few of your biggest losers, then your performance will be greatly improved going forward.

In the long run, not losing much money can be just as profitable as making money.

As you analyze the year's top stocks, print them out and mark them up with a pen. Start off with proper entry points. Ideally, where should you have bought the stock? Was there a cup-with-handle, a flat base, or a double bottom?

To help train your eye spotting patterns, you can use _How to Make Money in Stocks_" by William J. O'Neil, or MarketSmith's _Pattern Recognition_ feature.

Next, where should you have sold the stock? Look for sell signals, both offensive and defensive. An offensive sell signal occurs on the way up, like a climax top. A defensive sell signal occurs on the way down, like a decisive break of the 50-day line.

Keep in mind that being down 7%-8% from the buy point is an automatic sell rule.

If the stock wasn't on your radar at all, keep an eye on IBD's stock lists, like the [IBD 50](http://marketsmith.investors.com//Learn/StockGuide/Default.aspx), [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and [Stock Spotlight](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/).

If you want to build your own screens with custom criteria, the quarterly [MarketSmith Stock Guide](http://marketsmith.investors.com//Learn/StockGuide/Default.aspx) can provide guidance on relevant screens in the current market. For example, the [Autumn Stock Guide](http://marketsmith.investors.com/special/stockguide-autumn2016.pdf) highlighted earnings gap ups and gap downs.

The best growth stock of 2016 was **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). The stock broke out of a classic cup with handle in March 2016 and proceeded to rise 246% from its 33.16 buy point.
If you mishandled it or missed it altogether, study the stock and its move so you can capitalize on a similar situation next time. Every year, stocks break out of proper chart patterns and go up more than 100%.

You also want to include the general market conditions at the time to see if the distribution day count affected your overall performance. History shows that three out of four stocks follow the general market, so tracking the general market is an easy step to potentially reduce losses.

Keep it simple. You need to have two or three different rules from a post-analysis. You don't want to completely overhaul your investing strategy, since it may negatively affect your positive investing traits.

Similar to a batting stance in baseball, you don't want to overhaul your strategy completely -- you make adjustments and examine their impact.

Investing isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. Only by continually improving yourself can you achieve long-term investing success.

True or false: Greed and fear look different on a stock chart.


Absolutely true. Greed sends a stock rising in price. A stock drops on fear.


Okay, that was easy. How about this? True or false: The speed in which a stock moves up on greed is the same as when a stock goes down on fear.


If you've bought and sold growth stocks for a year or longer, you might agree that the answer is not so simple. Sometimes it's true, but most of the time it's false.


When greed is widespread, a stock can roar with the force of a space shuttle at liftoff. A climax run — when a stock goes up faster in price in a few weeks than it ever has over the course of its run — shows how fast a leader can rise.


But in most cases, fear causes a stock to lose its gains in far less time than it took to amass them.


Why? Fear is mankind's survival tool. Imagine a fire at a packed movie house. You can bet people will rush out of the room much faster than they walked in.


Some legendary investors strove to sell before investors panicked.


In IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks," he quoted Wall Street maven Joseph Kennedy as saying: "The object is to get out while a stock is up before it has a chance to break and turn down."


To maximize your profits, be mindful of how fear greases the wheels of a stock once it's topped. Review the Investor's Corner series on 22 top sell rules to lock in gains; it ran from Jan. 4 to Feb. 4 and is available in the Education section of Investors.com.


**NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)) broke out and soared 1,880% soon after the 1998 bear market ended in October that year **1** to its peak of 152.75 in October 2000. It's worth checking out just how fast it surrendered those awesome gains.


The pioneer in network-attached data storage gear recovered from a huge sell-off in October 1998 and cleared a V-shaped base with a 61.35 buy point in heavy volume on Nov. 5 (chart shows split-adjusted prices). NetApp formed a new base in the summer of 1999, broke out again, sprinted for seven months and formed another deep base in the first half of 2000 **2**.


The stock's climb took more than 23 months before it peaked. Earnings more than tripled from fiscal 1998 to 2000, ending in April each year. Sales grew 78%, 74% and 100% over the same time frame.


NetApp broke out in September 2000 just as the major indexes were rolling over. But the breakout failed and the stock slid fast.


NetApp fell 64% over six weeks in October and November **3**, then gave up all its gains going back to November 1998 in less than 12 months **4**.

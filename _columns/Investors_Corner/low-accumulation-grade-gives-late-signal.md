IBD's proprietary ratings help you select and buy the best growth stocks. But in a few cases, they can help you decide when to sell a stock and preserve your precious gains.

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating helps you judge how the strongest forces of the market — namely mutual funds, big investment advisers, insurance firms and banks — view a stock.

This tool, found in IBD's Research Tables and in the Stock Checkup at Investors.com, analyzes a stock's price and volume changes over the past 13 weeks.

An A or B grade indicates that institutional investors are net buyers — a clear positive. Their heavy buying ensures a stock's long-term success. A C rating means buying and selling are generally balanced. If you see a D or E, selling is heavy; you should avoid the stock.

You also shouldn't wait for a stock's Accumulation Rating to fall to a D or E before deciding to ditch it. Using a daily and weekly chart to gauge a stock's health and following good sell rules should be your top priority in deciding whether to hold or sell. Yet sometimes, the Accumulation rating can help give you a timely signal to exit the stock.

**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)), a big winner since the market's March 2009 bottom, broke out of a 14-month saucer with handle in the week ended July 13, 2007 **1**. That week, it finished at 85.13, 3% above its 82.99 buy point. ([Click here](https://www.investors.com/ICChart11411.pdf) for expanded weekly chart.)

In the next week, Cat worked its way higher, rising another 2.2%. But on July 20, it gapped down more than 4% as volume ballooned to 38.7 million shares, more than six times its daily average **2**. That decline didn't trigger the 8% sell rule, but Cat's Accumulation Rating slipped to a C+ in the July 24 edition of IBD from A- in just six days.

Two days later, the rating sank to a D+. At that point, Cat's close at 80.55 was still just 3% below its 82.99 buy point **3**, but the Accumulation gauge pointed to heavy institutional selling in a timely way.

The Accumulation sell signal didn't work for **Broadcom** ([BRCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRCM)).

While most leading tech stocks peaked as the Nasdaq made a high on March 10, 2000, the cable equipment and communications chipmaker mustered enough strength to form one last base, a wide-and-loose cup with handle **4**. Broadcom lurched past its 261.66 buy point to new highs in the week ended Aug. 25. Volume was higher, but well below average **5**.

In IBD's Aug. 25 edition, Broadcom notched a B Accumulation Rating. When the stock backtracked four straight days and fell 8% from the buy point, forcing investors to cut their loss, its Accumulation still rated a solid B.

It wasn't until after Nov. 8 — when Broadcom slid to 151.81 **6**, 42% from the buy point — when the rating slumped to a D.

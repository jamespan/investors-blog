Without a crowd, there can be no stock market. But the crowd can be the market's own worst enemy.

That's because crowd behavior tends to be most wrong when it reaches its most extreme levels. In other words, when everyone is bullish, expect a market top; when everyone is bearish, the market bottoms.

This is best known as contrarian wisdom.

Beginning today, Investor's Corner looks at investor sentiment in this brief informal series on investor psychology. The bulls vs. bears survey can serve as an important psychological gauge.

Don't forget that while sentiment indicators can help you understand the market better, they are no substitute for a continuous study of the major indexes and their volume. Let the analysis found in The Big Picture be your primary market guide.

Each week, Investors Intelligence tracks more than 100 stock market newsletters, and measures how many are making bullish calls and how many are advising against owning stocks.

When the number of bulls reaches unusually high levels — you guessed it — the market is often near a significant top. When fear is running highest among newsletter editors, a market bottom is not far away.

The survey's most recent results are published in IBD each day, today on Page B11, and they are graphed over many months. That helps investors study trends in sentiment and when it's reaching peak levels.

Investors Intelligence says 55% or more bulls are considered danger levels for the market. The last time bulls topped 60% was in mid-October 2007 — near the end of a long bull market.

A good bottoming signal often occurs whenever the percentage of bears exceeds the bulls. That's an unusually fearful level from which new uptrends can emerge.

"The bears haven't outnumbered the bulls since October 2011, after the correction from highs that April," the Nov. 27 survey noted. The market bottomed right around that time. A similar bottoming signal occurred around September 2010.

Today's bulls vs. bears survey is showing a frothy market. The latest survey found more than 58% of newsletters making bullish calls. The bears are near a historic low going back toward the end of the 1980s bull market, Investors Intelligence says.

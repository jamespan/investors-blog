The [I in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) represents one of the key driving factors behind the stock market's advances and declines and big runs by the best growth stocks: the big money.




The big money is also known as institutional investors, so the "I" stands for institutional sponsorship. That refers to ownership of shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions and other big investors. Since their buying and selling account for the majority of trading on the stock exchanges, it's a good idea to have them on your side.


"Buy only those stocks that have at least a few institutional sponsors with better-than-average recent performance records and that have added institutional owners in recent quarters," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


These heavyweights tend to buy thousands of shares at a time. After all, they deploy millions to billions of dollars in the market on behalf of their clients. The pros will usually buy shares in an installment-like frequency, instead of all at once, to avoid running prices up too much. So it can take weeks, or even months, for them to build a full position.

Growth Stocks And How To Judge Fund Sponsorship
-----------------------------------------------


Mutual funds report their portfolio holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter. Investors can access the data on the SEC's Edgar website.


When researching individual stocks, always check to see if they are owned by institutions. IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating, available for every stock in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), is a finger on the pulse of institutional activity. The rating ranges from A to E, with an A pointing to strong net buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks, and an E indicating recent net selling. A C is neutral, so an A or B is preferable.


The proprietary rating is also available in the daily stock tables and minicharts in the weekly print issue, IBD Weekly. Another useful gauge is the number of funds buying shares — you'd ideally see an increase from quarter to quarter. Both metrics show up in the Technical Performance section of Stock Checkup, under the "Supply And Demand" header.


[MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks), a premium research product of IBD, shows the number of funds owning shares over the past four quarters.


Want additional sources of insight into the best mutual funds? You can browse through recent articles by going to [ETFs & Funds](https://www.investors.com/etfs-funds/) in the Research section of Investors.com. The monthly mutual fund special, found online as well as in the IBD Weekly newspaper, offers insight into which stocks the top funds are buying.


Growth Stocks And The Big Run By Alaska Air
-------------------------------------------



A May 7, 2014, special section noted **Alaska Airlines** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) as one of the stocks being bought heavily by top fund managers.


Shares of the airline went on to form a [good double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) from July to September 2014, then broke out with a 12% upward thrust during the week ended Oct. 24. The buy point was 48.35, 10 cents above the middle peak between the two lows of 41.84 and 40.69.


From that late-October breakout, Alaska Air shares flew more than 80% higher to a December 2015 high of 87.17. Not a bad gain in 14 months' work. (See a historical chart of Alaska Air at [MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks).)

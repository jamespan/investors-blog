The cup without handle and cup with handle are some of the most common chart patterns. They have a less commonly seen cousin: the saucer base, which can also lead to large gains.

Saucers are usually more stretched out and flatter than a typical cup-type base. As the name suggests, they resemble the silhouette of shallow dishes or saucers.

While some chart patterns scare investors out with fast, sharp corrections, saucers have the distinction of wearing investors out.

So if you see a potential saucer forming, patience can be a virtue. Saucers can be as short as seven weeks. But some can form over several months or even be as long as a year or more.

After a prior uptrend of at least 20% or 30%, a stock will slowly drift lower, then trade almost sideways before finally forming the right side of the base.

Saucer bases tend to correct no more than 12% to 20% in an uptrending market. Some, however, can be as much as 30% or more in down markets.

Many times, slower-moving big-cap stocks will form saucers. Because saucers tend to form in large caps and the pattern tends to take more time, such stocks may show lower-than-average Relative Price Strength Ratings at the breakout. Thus, you may want to relax your watch-list criteria when hunting for this pattern.

Leading stocks should have a Relative Price Strength Rating of 85 or higher. But for stocks that are forming saucer bases, the RS Rating can slip to as low as the 50-to-70 range.

Remember that the RS Rating compares a stock's price performance over the past 12 months to other stocks. So a stock that meanders as it forms a saucer base will often have a lackluster RS Rating.

To get the buy point in a saucer, just add 10 cents to the high of the pattern. Sometimes, a saucer will have a handle, offering a lower entry point.

In the week ended July 8, 2005, **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) cleared a 63.61 buy point from a handle in a six-month saucer **1** in huge volume.

The biotech pioneer's RS Rating prior to breaking out was 60. Amgen's saucer was actually within a much larger pattern. The saucer spanned just over six months and corrected 14%. The stock ran up 37% by late September before settling into another base **2**.

Nothing makes an investor angrier than getting shaken out of a stock, perhaps being forced to take a loss, then watching it climb into the stratosphere.


It makes you want to throw something across the room.


Relax. It happens to everybody. Even IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil has said he has been shaken out of big winners.


If it's a stock in which he has conviction, O'Neil has said, he will buy back his full position when the stock recovers â€” and, sometimes, add a few extra shares.


Let's say you were reading IBD on the morning of April 2, 2003, and you spotted a mini-chart of **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)). It was the first item in what is now called Stock Spotlight (today on Page B5).


You were aware the general market had followed through March 17 (the Nasdaq jumped 3.9% that day), a smart rally was underway and you were looking for fresh breakouts to buy.


Dick's had just broken out of a 16-week cup with handle, rising 1.66, or 7%, to 24.57. The base showed plenty of signs of accumulation. Volume on the breakout was 357% above average.


The company had everything going for it: an EPS Rating of 98; a Relative Price Strength Rating of 96; a five-year growth rate of 48%; EPS growth in the most recent quarter of 31%.


It was a new issue that had just started trading the previous October. Dick Stack opened his first sporting goods store in 1948, and by 2003 his son, Ed, had taken the company public. He was also expanding the chain nationally.


It was the perfect retail play, and you snapped it up at 25. That's about 5% above the 23.80 buy point, but barely within buy range.


That was your first mistake. If you had bought much closer to the correct buy point, you might have been able to weather the storm.


On the morning of April 14, the stock abruptly tanked. At its low, Dick's hit 22.35 **1**. At least for a brief time, you were now down more than 10% below your buy point.


Dick's found support at its 50-day moving average, but you had to sell anyway.


It takes courage to get back on a horse that has thrown you off. It's the same with stocks. The stock recovered and closed up 5% that day on volume 515% above average **2**. The stock would, indeed, be a big winner. By the summer of 2005, Dick's had gained 240%.

One day, the roast beef and premium turkey breast sandwiches that you're accustomed to eating in the cafeteria suddenly get replaced by slabs of Spam.


Unless you wish to starve during lunchtime, you'd better get used to the latter.


Treat your stock winners the same. The stock market is not Burger King. You can't always have it your way.


Even if you're playing by rules that tell you to take profits when gains amount to a certain percentage, there's no guarantee that a stock will ever move up by that amount. Sometimes you have to tone down your expectations and take whatever the market will give you.


**Adjust Your Profit Goals**


Following sound buy and sell rules is key to success in the stock market; this doesn't change whether or not the market is good. But you don't always have to be totally rigid. Sometimes it pays to be flexible.


If stocks breaking out from bases are only moving up at a mild pace before fizzling, then learn to take profits at lower levels.


In most cases, investors should take at least some profits off the table once a stock rises 20% to 25% past a proper buy point. That is the ideal scenario in the right market condition.


The underlying condition of the general market has a big impact on how individual stocks trade.


In a roaring bull market, you're likely to see many highly rated growth stocks go on to produce stout gains after breaking out from base patterns, such as [cups with handles](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/775382-look-at-the-details-in-a-base.htm), double bottoms, flat bases and high, tight flags. A small number will even double in price or more.


On the other hand, when the market gets choppy, you're much less likely to see highly rated growth stocks make significant progress. So in choppy market conditions, where the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are stuck in narrow trading ranges, lower your profit targets.


Hit the sell button once you have a profit of 10% to 15%. When you practice this more conservative approach, don't wait for a stock to hand you a loss of 8% before selling. Instead, sell a stock once it falls 3% to 5% below where you bought it. This way, you'd keep a 3-to-1 win/loss ratio.


Choppy markets are much tougher to trade. The major market indexes usually move very little in listless turnover.


Besides choppy markets, investors should also aim to take smaller gains when a bull market is in its late stage. Bull runs on average last about three or four years.


This year is proving to be challenging for many investors. Earlier this year, **Barracuda Networks** ([CUDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUDA)) formed a very long cup-like base with a 40.81 buy point. In late February, the stock traded in choppy fashion, narrowly missing the 40.81 entry at times.


Barracuda finally topped the 40.81 trigger, rising 15% in the week ended April 10. Volume was heavy on the actual breakout day of April 7, and it was also well above average for the week **(1)**. Despite choppy market conditions, the stock was still able to rally nearly 15% before losing steam **(2)**.


By the end of April, the stock had given back that near 15% gain, which marked a sell signal **(3)**. The stock has struggled lately, now sitting 60% below its 46.78 peak.

**Sell Winners Like A Pro:** [Ninth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/611488/201205211612/how-to-sell-winners-like-a-pro.aspx)

When a stock has made a huge run and begins to stall, don't complain. Show no mercy.

If you own a stock from lower price levels and see a flawed, problematic or downright ugly breakout from a late-stage base, use the opportunity to sell the troubled stock into strength.

Just the fact that your stock is breaking out from a late-stage base should have you in red alert in the first place.

Stocks, like living beings, have a life cycle. Some are longer than others, but sooner or later death comes to it, as it does to all men.

Once you have that late-stage base to worry about, any flawed breakout would be a sell signal.

Flaws like what? Like unusually low volume as the stock pushes past its buy point, for starters. Or if the stock closes on breakout day well below its buy point. Or if it repeatedly closes in the lower 40% of the day's trading range.

Or if the stock's breakout, which may look fine at first, is followed quickly by a series of high-volume declines. There'd be no room for mercy here.

Let's look at **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU))'s top last July. Shares of China's dominant search engine formed a cup with handle **1**, the latest in a long string of bases stretching back about two years.

Was there anything to not like about the last base — other than being a late-stage structure? Maybe.

The cup ran 27% deep — reasonable for a cup pattern. But it was the deepest of Baidu's seven bases (including some base-on-base patterns). The prior six bases ran from 11% to 20% deep.

The 27% correction is no deal killer, but perhaps it could serve to raise your attention just a bit.

Baidu broke out July 19. It looked lovely: a gap-up 3% surge, and a close at the day's high. But volume was 14% below its average pace.

Now you're holding a stock that had already posted fantastic gains and is showing, for the first time, a problematic breakout from a late-stage base. That's your sell signal.

Happily, the stock kept rising for awhile. A second, exhaustion-looking gap appeared July 26 as volume roared. (Please see a daily chart.) You wouldn't have had to wait for that gain. Unloading anytime after that iffy breakout would have been appropriate. Baidu fell 39% from its 165.96 peak by late September **2**.

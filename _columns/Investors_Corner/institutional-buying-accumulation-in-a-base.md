  Accumulation In A Stock's Base Can Presage A Breakout

It takes practice to recognize the contour of a cup-with-handle pattern, a double bottom and a flat base. But there's a lot more to analyzing a potential big winner than recognizing chart patterns.


The devil is in the details when it comes to determining if a stock is truly under accumulation and therefore a serious buy candidate in the future.


Proper bases have a certain look to them, but there are also elements of strength to look for that can set great breakouts apart from lackluster ones.


Today's [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) kicks off a new series on core elements of a great base.


Once you're working with a sound pattern, look under the hood and ask this question: Is the stock under accumulation, or are there signs that big investors are liquidating their positions?


"Accumulation" refers to strong institutional buying. "Distribution" signifies unusually heavy institutional selling that can lead to a future top in a leading stock and a sharp decline ahead.


**Examine Weekly Volume Changes**


On a weekly chart, make sure that weekly price gains in above-average volume outnumber down weeks in heavy volume. They're pointing toward a stock under net accumulation. In IBD's weekly charts, the moving average line for volume denotes the average volume over the past 10 weeks.


If accumulation weeks are even with distribution weeks, don't automatically dismiss the stock, especially if it's a name with CAN SLIM traits.


Not all down weeks are created equal. If a stock closes lower for the week but ends in the upper 60% of its weekly trading price range, it can be viewed as a support week, not as distribution.


Suppose a stock traded between 90 and 100 before finishing the week at 94.50. Multiply 10 (the trading price range) by 0.40 to get 4, then add 90. Any price above 94 would fall within the proper range.


Look for support weeks when the stock is pulling back, forming the left side of the base. Support weeks are also good to see at the bottom of the base. Also, volume on the up weeks in price should generally be heavier than on the down weeks.


**Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)) formed a cup-with-handle base in the summer of 2012 with three accumulation weeks and zero distribution weeks.


The first accumulation week was subtle and was seen when the left side of the base was forming **(1)**. The second one occurred during the week ended July 27  **(2),** when the stock reversed higher for a gain of nearly 10%. That was a powerful reversal.


The following week, volume was above average again, but the stock closed unchanged **(3)**. At the time, it might not have looked like accumulation, but the tight weekly close was bullish, indicating that big investors were sitting tight.


In the final week of August, Manhattan broke out at 50.10 in heavy turnover and more than tripled over the next 18 months.

When a bird watcher spots a rare find, he might not know the species. But at least it's clear that he is looking at a bird.


The challenge posed by a base called the high, tight flag is very different. Unless investors have studied the pattern and know its characteristics, they might not recognize that it is a base at all.


A fast-rising stock could quickly consolidate, break past a buy point and charge on to serious gains. The unwitting investor would never have known this was a rare bird or that there was an opportunity missed.


A high, tight flag has three distinct elements. First, a stock must gain 100% to 120% in a span of four to eight weeks. That forms the flagpole upon which to hang your high, tight flag.


The second element, the flag itself, forms as the stock pulls back, usually 10% to 20% or sometimes 25%, in the next three to five weeks. Price patterns are often wide and loose during these weeks â€” trading doesn't have to be tight, as the name implies. But the action appears tight vs. the steep run-up before the base.


Similar to the handle portion for a cup-with-handle base, volume generally dries up. Big fund managers are holding the stock.


Element number three is the breakout, when the stock clears the peak of the flagpole in big turnover, meaning daily volume that's at least 40% above average.


Stocks that have cleared the bases form an impressive crew. **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) formed an imperfect high, tight flag right after its August 2004 debut.


Stun-gun company **Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) formed the pattern in 2003. Tech innovator **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) shaped it in 1999.


High, tight flags are high-risk bases. Many fail. Investors must keep a close eye on stocks climbing out of such a pattern. High-flying, China-based stocks have recently seemed especially prone to forming and then faltering out of such patterns.


**JinkoSolar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) broke out from a high, tight flag in November 2010, then immediately began to unravel. **NQ Mobile** ([NQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NQ)) broke out in September 2013, rose not quite 30% in the next month, then collapsed 57% in a single week.


American Dairy tried to weave a flag in the summer of 2009. It climbed in heavy trade to within a dime of the buy point, then dropped 55% in two weeks.


A much more positive example: **JDS Uniphase** ([JDSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JDSU)) near the end of 1999. The stock bounced off its 10-week line near mid-October and advanced 136% in six weeks. It pulled back 23% in the next three weeks. Weekly trading ranges were a little wild and wooly, but the closes were relatively tight.


The stock broke out past the 68.43 buy point (adjusted for two 2-for-1 stock splits) in the week ended Dec. 24. Volume was quiet, not a big surprise during a holiday week. Trade picked up on Dec. 27, then more seriously at the start of January.


JDS rose 124% before topping in the first week of March.

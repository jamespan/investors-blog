The investment world is full of ideas on how to reduce portfolio volatility.


From fixed income to shorting your long positions as a hedge, most are white-flag strategies: Accept smaller gains.


Yet, the smaller-gains idea is completely backward. Smaller losses, not smaller gains, are a better way to achieve stability.


Volatility in itself isn't bad. If a stock is gapping up, that's volatility, but no one's complaining. What you don't want is the roller coaster portfolio that rises and then takes you back to the starting point — or somewhere lower.


One tool for fighting that kind of volatility is the 8% loss rule.


Now some folks say the 8% sell rule is flawed. If you take three 8% losses in a row, it will take a 28.4% gain to break even. How is that different than holding a stock through a 28% correction?


The criticism, though, involves an improper understanding.


What's missing? Several things.


First, the disciplined IBD investor doesn't need to invoke the 8% sell rule all that often.


Let's say the portfolio is concentrated on five potential positions of 20% exposure each.


The market is in an uptrend. When a quality stock in a quality industry group breaks out, the investor opens a half position (10% of the portfolio) in the stock. If the stock doesn't rise at least 2.5%, no additional shares are bought.


In most cases, the stock is sold — sometimes for a small loss, and sometimes for a tiny gain. The investor does not wait for the stalled stock to sag to minus 8%.


Note also how the initial half-position protects the investor. A mistake costs half what it would if he began with a full position.


A second rule can also help the investor avoid the 8% loss. This rule says the investor shouldn't let a profit cycle into a loss.


For example, suppose a breakout works. The stock rises 15% in three or four weeks. But then the stock begins to fall. A 15% gain becomes a 12% gain and then an 8% gain. At some point, the investor has to start thinking about selling before the stock cycles into a loss. Under no circumstances should the stock be held until it reaches minus 8%.


A third strategy also helps the investor steer clear of the 8% loss. The investor will sell a weaker stock to add shares to a stronger performer as opportunities on the chart develop.


Suppose you have a stock that is up or down by a puny percentage. Selling this stock will raise cash for your stronger performer. It also will help you avoid the minus 8% situation. Your worst stock has a higher probability of becoming a minus 8% position than your best stock does.


Fourth, the investor who misfires on several trades in a row should study not only the failed stocks but the overall market situation.


An investor sometimes blames failed or incomplete trades on his or her stock-picking skills. In some cases, picking second-rate stocks is the problem. But a series of failed trades also could be sending a message that the market is perhaps turning wobbly. If so, the investor needs to start raising cash, and that also means not waiting for a position to turn to minus 8% before selling.


Your portfolio will become more profitable and more stable if you learn how to use defensive rules to limit the downside in top-rated growth stocks.

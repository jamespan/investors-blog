If an investor has a fast-rising stock, the question is when to sell.

Many investment strategies don't even mention that question. It's as if a flight school taught students how to take off but not how to land.

The IBD way offers both loss-limiting and profit-taking guidelines. Today we're going to talk about one profit-taking angle — how you can use the base count to help define a profit-taking area.

Imagine it's September 2010. **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) shapes a double-bottom base, **(1)** undercutting the prior base's low and thereby resetting the base count at one.

A first- or second-stage base is more likely to work than later patterns. This affects whether you buy the stock, but it also can affect your holding strategy.

If you buy the first-stage breakout, you could set your goal on holding through the second-stage breakout and advance. You can sell when the second-stage advance ends and appears to be beginning a third-stage base.

Another way is to sell at the first sign of weakness from the third-stage breakout — if there is a third-stage base and breakout.

If there is no third-stage breakout, you sell when the pattern begins to fall apart.

After breaking out of a first-stage base, Lululemon advanced 71% in three months.

Then the stock shaped a second-stage base. The base corrected 12%, making it easy to hold.

Lululemon cleared the new buy point in February 2011 **(2)** and rose 14%, not enough to change the base count for the next pattern.

In April 2011, Lululemon cleared the second-stage, base on base. **(3)** The stock rose 20% from the base on base. This represented a 136% gain from the first-stage breakout.

The 20% gain meant the next pattern would be third stage. So, some investors could've either cashed in the gain or they could've committed to selling after a third-stage breakout.

The third-stage breakout came in June 2011. **(4)**  The stock rose 25% above the buy point in a month. Disciplined investors would've sold during that run. The goal is to sell on the way up, not the way down.

Perfect timing would've brought a 196% gain from the first-stage breakout. Realistically, first-stage buyers got less but still more than doubled their money.

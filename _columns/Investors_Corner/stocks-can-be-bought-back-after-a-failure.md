The saying "once bitten, twice shy" often applies to investors, who tend to shun stocks that burned them once.


There's nothing wrong with moving on to another promising stock, especially if you lack conviction in the stock that just tanked. But even stocks with top fundamental and technical traits can shake you out once or twice before they finally get going, which is why it can pay to watch for a chance to get back in.


**3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)), a maker of printers that produce three-dimensional objects, offers an example. It broke out above a 44.90 buy point in a cup base on Nov. 1, 2012 (before a 3-for-2 split in late February). Those who bought at that point would have watched the stock quickly turn tail. By Nov. 16, **(1)** it had plunged 19% below the buy point, triggering the 8% sell rule along the way.


Two things were wrong on the day of the breakout. First, the overall market was in a correction, and few stocks can buck a market downdraft. Even though 3D rose 4% that day, volume was below normal. You want to see turnover rise at least 40% above average on the breakout.


But 3D soon regained its footing and retook the entry Nov. 26 amid a new market uptrend. Volume that day jumped to almost three times the stock's daily average. **(2)** From there, 3D climbed 60% to a peak of 71.98 on Jan. 23 of this year.


3D's fundamentals hadn't changed at all from the initial breakout to the second breakout. The Composite Rating was a best-possible 99, while the Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength ratings were both 98. The only real difference was the market's status, which is shown each day in the Market Pulse box accompany the [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm?nav=NewsTheBigPicture).


An early indication of a stock's resilience after a failed breakout usually comes at the 10-week moving average. (See a weekly chart.) If the stock has sliced through that key support level, watch to see how it acts at that point on the way back up.


In fact, IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil recommends repurchasing the stock if it crosses back above the 10-week line in higher volume than when it fell below it.


3D's rebound back above the 10-week line came in lower volume than its drop below the line, so it wouldn't have been a buyback candidate at that point. But weekly volume was huge during the second breakout.

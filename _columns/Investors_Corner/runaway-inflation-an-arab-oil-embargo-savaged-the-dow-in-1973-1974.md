It was the age of the Nifty Fifty: 50 blue chip stocks with which, it was widely believed, investors couldn't lose money.


Optimism was boundless. The Dow Jones industrial average had rallied 70% off a May 1970 low. In reality? There had been two stock markets, the Nifty Fifty, which rose, and the rest of the market, which didn't.


On Jan. 11, 1973, the Dow hit an all-time intraday high of 1067.20 in the highest volume since Aug. 16, 1971. Note those two dates. They turned out to be important.


The study of past bull and bear markets is an essential exercise for investors because history repeats itself.Â The skilled trader will see the same forces of demand and supply at work in all major market bottoms and tops.


Let's consider the terrible bear market of 1973-1974, at the time the worst since the crash of 1929-1932. It is a story of poor policy coupled with investor complacency, runaway inflation and a final surprise blow administered by the first Arab oil embargo.![ICch-dow-052016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ICch-dow-052016-1024x587.jpg)


The bear market and the recession that accompanied it had their origins in the failed economic policies of President Richard Nixon.


On Aug. 15, 1971, Nixon suspended the convertibility of dollars into gold, froze wages and prices for 90 days, and imposed a 10% surcharge on imports. Investors loved it, bidding the Dow up 3.9% the next day in heavy volume.


Over the next 18 months, Nixon established guidelines and a bureaucracy to gradually allow prices to rise. Then on Jan. 11, 1973, he announced Phase 3 of his economic plan, which made wage and price guidelines voluntary. Business and labor saw the chance to raise prices and make wage demands. The bear market started the next day, although most investors didn't realize it. Almost no one realized the market was on the precipice.


Inflation spiraled out of control. At the end of January, Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers predicted 3% inflation for the year. It turned out to be 9%.


With inflation raging, on June 14 Nixon ordered wages and prices frozen for 60 days.


Between Jan. 12 and Aug. 22, the Dow lost 21%, then started to rally. On that final down day, Nixon, plagued by the Watergate scandal, held his first news conference in five months and said he wouldn't resign.


A follow-through day occurred Aug. 29. From there, upside volume was strong and the Dow rallied 13% into within a hair's breadth of the 1,000 mark. It looked like investors had survived nothing more than a garden variety bear market.


The market rise didn't pause in September even as the government reported consumer prices exploding to an annualized rate of 22.8%.


The market remained buoyant on Oct. 6 when Israel's Arab neighbors launched a surprise attack, beginning the Yom Kippur War, and it didn't immediately drop on Oct. 19 when several Arab nations cut off oil exports to the U.S. because of its support for Israel.


The slide began Oct. 29 that took 21% off the Dow in six weeks. In the waning days of 1973, the effect of the embargo started to take hold.


1974 was annus horribilis for investors. After a first-quarter pause, the stock market collapse began. The Nifty Fifty was pummeled. Inflation roared out of control. Motorists lined up for blocks to buy what little gasoline could be obtained.


On Aug. 9, Nixon resigned. Five straight down weeks that followed took the Dow down another 19%. It hit a low Oct. 4, briefly rallied, then fell again, undercutting the prior low Dec. 9 with an intraday low of 569.70. The market had fallen 47% in three legs down, in 21 gut-wrenching months.


There was no more talk about the Nifty Fifty.

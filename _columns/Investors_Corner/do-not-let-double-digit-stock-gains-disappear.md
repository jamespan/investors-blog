**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

Watching your stock notch double-digit gains from your purchase price is sweet. But feelings can sour fast if you let gains evaporate or even cycle into a loss. That's why learning to take at least some profits when a stock rises 20% to 25% from your purchase price is a prudent [stock selling strategy](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx).

  

Why 20%? Or 25%?

  

Most stocks tend to pause in order to digest such large gains. So even if you decide not to sell the entire position, you can lock in partial gains, then see if the stock can continue its advance.

  

With extra cash in hand, you can also put the winnings to work in another promising stock that's staging a fresh breakout.

  

There is one exception to the 20% to 25% profit-taking rule. A special rule kicks in for outperformers that are able to reach the 20% threshold in less than three weeks from a breakout or an initial rebound off the 10-week moving average.

  

As its name suggests, the eight-week hold rule suggests keeping shares for eight weeks from the breakout. When the rule expires, you can decide if you should sell or continue to hold to see if it can rack up further gains.

  

No matter which you decide, avoid taking a so-called round trip, when a stock gives up all of its gains from the breakout â€” a sell signal.

  

**GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) surged at its June 26 debut last year, then consolidated for seven weeks. The stock broke out at 50 in an IPO base on Aug. 29 and triggered the eight-week hold rule as it bolted more than 40% in just two weeks **(1)**.

  

Shares of the maker of wearable action-cameras didn't disappoint, nearly doubling in price over the next three weeks. But new issues tend to be more volatile than their older counterparts.

  

GoPro showed churning action Oct. 7 as it closed in the lower half in heavy trade, after touching a new high, another key sell rule (see the daily chart). Seven straight declines followed, about six weeks into the hold rule. The stock was still up nearly 50% from the buy point by the time the hold expired in October **(2)**.

  

This was a good time to lock in gains, as GoPro continued to trend lower in mostly heavy volume. At this point, a gain should never be allowed to turn into a loss. At the Jan. 16 low, those who bought at 50 would have been down 9% **(3)**. The loss widened to 15% by the Feb. 10 low **(4)**, and 26% by the March 10 bottom.

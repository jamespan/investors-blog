You've amassed 10,000 hours (or close to that) studying the charts of awesome market winners. You know IBD's [key rules for selecting stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) inside out. You've mastered the art of building a good watchlist in minutes. And when IBD's current outlook says "Market in uptrend," you know how to pounce on breakouts as stocks [race past the proper buy point in big volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).




OK, so you've achieved da Vinci-like mastery of the [nuts and bolts of smart investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) in growth stocks. Yet sometimes your investing performance just might not hit the level you desire. What can you do?


Consider these five steps.


Step One: Review And Review
---------------------------


IBD strongly believes that each investor do an [annual review of past trades](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/making-money-in-2018-study-your-past-stock-trades-focus-on-true-leaders/) each year. Do it anytime. Do it to zap bad habits and erase serious mistakes. Now, take it a step further. Compare your best performers with the top names in IBD's top-growth screens. Check out the highfliers in [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Global Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/global-leaders/) and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).


You may notice that many of the stocks making these features are "high" in price, and yet they still form good bases. Then, they break out in surging volume. Plus, they don't fall that much during squalls of selling in the market.


Some beginning investors make the mistake of seeking "bargains" or thinly traded issues. Price is a barometer of investment quality.


Apple Wasn't A Penny Stock
--------------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) clearly shows why "buying low" is a poor method. When the iPhone and iPad maker broke out in August 2003, just months after the Nasdaq finally ended its huge bear market and turned in March 2003, the stock traded near 21 bucks a share, not 21 cents.


Remember, financial institutions have millions, even billions, of dollars to deploy. They want companies that can grow in the long run and attract plenty of shareholders. Never forget the [I in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/), which stands for strong institutional accumulation.


So, as a rule, set a minimum share price for any stock that you buy at, say, 20 or higher. In IBD's [Stocks on the Move screen](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx), don't be surprised to see leadership-quality companies trading at 40 a share or 400 a share, yet still post big price increases in above-average turnover. This screen captures many big leaders [*before they break out*](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Such action implies large fund managers are busy accumulating shares. Their long-term buying fuels breakouts and wonderful profits for the astute individual trader.


Use IBD's special timesaving tool, [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), to compare a stock's proprietary IBD ratings — from EPS to RS, from SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) to Accumulation/Distribution — with its peers in the same group.


Step Two: Positive Thinking, Positive Stock Trading
---------------------------------------------------


Just like top athletes, good stock investors don't let a few misses send them hustling for the showers, feeling down and out. They get back up, mentally speaking, and find out why things are not working.


"When I started investing, I made most of the same mistakes," Bill O'Neil wrote in "The Successful Investor." "I know how bad habits are formed and how hard it is to break them. But break them you must, so you can develop new habits based on how the market actually works."


Step Three: Get In Good Physical Shape
--------------------------------------


Garry Kasparov, the former world champion of chess from Azerbaijan, has said that he used to prepare for his serious matches in much the way that a pro boxer gets ready for a title fight. Kasparov, who became the youngest world chess champ at 22 in 1985, took a holistic approach of preparing.


In a game that requires plenty of mental stamina, nutrition and exercise gave him an edge.

Step Four: Eat Right
--------------------


These days, the marketplace is brimming with new foods, beverages and ingredients that can help keep you full of energy and perhaps maintain good or better health. Did this past winter's flu season knock you out for a few weeks, preventing you from doing your daily or weekly routine of researching stocks?


Getting the flu shot may or may not have helped. But it doesn't hurt to search for new innovations in nutrition to give you an edge.


Lisa Curtis, who served as a Peace Corps member in Niger, Africa, discovered that the leafy plant moringa contains twice as much protein on a per-gram basis than yogurt, four times as much vitamin A as carrots, three times as much potassium as bananas, and a whopping seven times as much vitamin C than oranges.


Using that knowledge, the Oakland, Calif.-based entrepreneur has developed an expanding line of easy-to-use and delicious foods, beverages and powders to help people of all ages get the proper nutrients and perform their best.


"Moringa is one of the most nutrient-dense plants on the planet," Curtis told IBD at the 2018 Expo West all-natural products trade show in Anaheim, Calif. "The leaves of the moringa tree are packed with protein, essential amino acids, 27 vitamins and 46 antioxidants. Customers tell us that moringa gives them energy and helps build their resilience to common ailments such as colds."


Step Five: Sleep Well
---------------------


Don't watch scary movies or shows with extremely violent content before you go to bed. That was the advice of an advanced IBD-style investor at a past [CAN SLIM Masters program](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=TradingSummit), the highest level workshop within IBD's live events, held in Santa Monica, Calif. Such content may lead to bad dreams and restless nights. You want to have a good night's sleep and be ready to act quickly the next morning when stocks move with force.


A veteran professional money manager and frequent speaker at IBD's CAN SLIM Masters seminar recently told IBD that getting a lot of sleep during the weekend helps him stay sharp at the start of the trading week. But by Thursday or Friday, his energy level falls because he's not sleeping as much during the middle of the week.


Taking naps outside market-trading hours can help anyone get through the rest of the week. But in order to stay sharp Thursday and Friday, consider keeping a regular sleep schedule on every weeknight.


Fantastic breakouts can take place on any day, and they wait for no one.

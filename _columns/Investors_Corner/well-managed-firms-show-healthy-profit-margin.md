  Demand Peak Profit Margin When Evaluating A Stock

If a company sells a widget for 50 cents and the widget costs a buck to make, the company probably won't be in business for very long.

  

But if the widget sells for a buck and it costs 50 cents to make, well, that's a different story. Welcome to the world of profit margins, a closely watched fundamental metric on Wall Street.

  

The financial literature shows a variety of definitions for profit margin. IBD focuses on a company's pretax and after-tax profit margins on a quarterly and annual basis. The math isn't complicated. It's income divided by sales. It answers the question: For every dollar in sales, how much does the company actually keep in earnings? Profit margin of 30% means a company keeps 30 cents for each dollar of sales.

  

You can find a firm's annual pretax margin in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/?termID=5979&term=IBD+Stock+Checkup%26reg%3b&mode=searchResults) at Investors.com. Another way to home in on firms with solid profit margin is with [IBD's SMR Rating](http://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/sales-----profit--margins-----roe--(smr)--rating). It looks at a company's sales, margin and return on equity. Stocks are rated on an A-to-E scale with A being the best. Focus on those with an A or B. Some turnaround companies may show a worse grade.

  

Return on equity (ROE) is another important metric to follow because similar to profit margin, it helps separate well-managed firms from poorly managed ones.

  

You should generally target firms with annual ROE of at least 17%. But IBD research has found that in certain cases, a great stock might not meet the 17% ROE minimum yet still become a great market winner due to other strong fundamentals, including high pretax margin.

  

**Ocwen Financial** ([OCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCN)) is a good example. ROE in 2012 was 12.2% but annual pretax margin hit a multi-year high of 30.5%. There's no specific threshold to look for when assessing profit margin; just make sure it's at or near peak levels (see accompanying table).

  

Remember that profit margin varies by industry. Tech companies like **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) are known for fat margins. In its latest reported quarter, Apple's after-tax margin was 21.9%. Pretty good on the surface but big profit margin isn't an automatic buy signal, especially in a case like Apple where margins have been compressing vs. year-ago levels in recent quarters.

  

Profit margin at retailers tend to be much lower. Annual pretax margin at discount retailer **TJX Companies** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)) has been accelerating since 2009. In fiscal 2013, margin hit 11.9%, nearly double what it was in 2008.

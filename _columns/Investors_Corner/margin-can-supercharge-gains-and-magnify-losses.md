  Using Margin At The Wrong Time Can Be Disastrous

Using margin can supercharge performance when used by an experienced and disciplined investor. But it can also magnify losses if used at the wrong time.

  

Don't make the mistake of trading on margin simply due to greed or desperation to make up for lost ground. You can do very well in stocks without margin.

  

Margin is cash borrowed from your broker that can be used to buy stocks. An investor with a margin account has generally twice the firepower of an investor with a cash account under current regulations. The monthly interest charge depends on the size of the loan and the broker.

  

If you've been actively investing for a few cycles, you know markets go down faster than they go up. That's because greed works slowly on the investor, while fear turns to panic in a nanosecond.

  

This is where margin can get you in trouble. Months of carefully nurtured profits can vanish in days or even hours if positions are not quickly unwound. They disappear twice as fast when you're on margin. That's why one must show discipline to sell winning stocks and take profits methodically on the way up.

  

Look at the correction that occurred Friday, Oct. 13, 1989. The market had rallied all year, driven by buyouts. At 2:30 p.m. ET, news came out that UAL, the parent of United Airlines, couldn't get financing for a leveraged buyout. Traders knew instantly the age of the LBO was endangered. What began as a modest down day for the Dow Jones industrial average turned into a rout.

  

The Dow lost 6.9% to 2569 **1**. The 191-point drop was the second-biggest point loss in history. One seer said the market wouldn't open Monday morning. (It did.)

  

Imagine you had \$20,000 in a margin account at the time. You have two stocks purchased earlier with cash, each for \$10,000. You have a 20% profit in one and a 10% profit in the other. You buy two more stocks on margin. Both are still at their buy points. Your \$40,000 investment is worth \$43,000. Your \$20,000 in equity shows an unrealized 15% gain.

  

The Oct. 13 correction hits. You end up selling your 20% gainer for a 10% profit, and you get out even on your 10% gainer. One of your fresh purchases drops 8% below the buy point and you sell, but the other gaps down and you're forced into a 12% loss. Your \$43,000 in holdings sinks to \$39,000. You're left with \$19,000 in cash for a 5% total loss.

  

This is how it happens in the real world. So be careful using margin.

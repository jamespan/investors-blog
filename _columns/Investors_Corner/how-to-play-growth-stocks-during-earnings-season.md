Earnings season can be tense.


Quarterly releases pose different challenges, depending on your situation. Let's look at three situations:


•What if you have a position in a stock? Should you sell before the earnings report to avoid a negative surprise, or hold?


Reasonable people will disagree on how cautious to be. Generally, a stock should be sold only when the chart says sell. That isn't just good defense. It could be your stock has gained 20% to 25% — an area where stocks often begin forming a new base.


So the 20%-to-25% gain is a good place to take profits in many cases. Other factors to weigh are how much of a profit cushion you have in your portfolio and how the market is currently reacting to misses and beats.


•What if a stock drops 7% or 8% below your entry just before the earnings report? Should you ignore the sell rule and see if the earnings news can bail you out?


Never.


If a bullish surprise causes the stock to gap up after you've sold, you can buy the stock back.


Yes, you pay more to get back in, but consider this reality: The chance of making money by paying more for a breakaway gap is typically greater than the chance of winning by holding a declining stock and hoping for the best.


•What if a stock breaks out just before earnings? Should you wait for the report? If the market is healthy and the base is good, you should not. Buy stocks based on the fundamentals and the technicals, not based on the news.


Earnings season also can help you judge the tone of the market.


A strong market will forgive misses. A weak market insists on perfection. Once you figure out the market's mood, it's easier to make buy and sell decisions.


After the close Feb. 2, 2011, **Green Mountain Coffee Roasters** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) reported a 64% gain in earnings on a 66% pop in revenue **1** (a weekly chart is shown). EPS beat the Street's estimates by a penny. Sales topped by 6%. The kicker: fiscal Q2 guidance was 38 cents to 42 cents a share vs. expectations for 33 cents.


The stock broke out of a cup with handle the next day **2** and advanced 205% in six months. **3**


One pundit wrote on the breakout day that Green Mountain was a "screaming short" because "the multiple is downright crazy." Research shows P-E multiples have little to do with sound investing.

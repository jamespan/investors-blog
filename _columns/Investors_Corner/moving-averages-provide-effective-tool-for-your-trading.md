Knowing when to buy or sell a stock need not be tricky. Doing some simple math to calculate the 200-day moving average of a stock can help investors make better decisions.

The 200-day moving average calculates the simple average of the closing price of a stock over the most recent 200 trading sessions. The line drawn from those numbers shows the trend of a stock over a long duration. It is not meant for short-term or momentum trading.

A simple trading strategy would be to buy shares that are above their [200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/) and sell them when they dip below. IBD founder William O'Neil considered a drop below the 200-day average a late sell signal. Other sell signals will appear before the 200-day line is violated.

When the stock breaches the moving average in strong volume, that is a better indicator of a downward trend than if it dipped below in low volume. Also, if the dip is a small one, shares could reverse back above their 200-day line.

When holding leading stocks in particular, it may be worthwhile to wait and see if they reverse after a small dip below the 200-day line.

Oil drilling company **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) started building a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in April 2022 **(1)** and broke out on June 8. The stock started weakening right away.

Halliburton made a decisive break of the 200-day moving average in early July **(2)**. By then, the stock had triggered two earlier sell signals: It hit the 7%-8% sell rule and broke below the 50-day average about the same time **(3)**. The stock has not recovered from the break of the 200-day line.

## A Nuanced Reading The 200-Day Moving Average

A more attentive investor canÂ  put this indicator to even better use.

Sometimes a declining stock may find support along this line. If that happens, look for new bases and buy points. That's exactly what happened with Halliburton's October 2021-January 2022 base.

Biotech **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) found support along this line twice in 2022: On May 2, shares rose 13% after finding support and again, on June 17, shares surged in strong volume from this support and gained as much as 10%. Amgen appears to be forming a base.

The 200-day line can also be a line of resistance for stocks. A stock's path is never linear and is filled with bases, breakouts and breakdowns. A stock often runs into resistance and finds support along the way as well.

On April 21 and Aug. 16 of 2022, the S&P 500 tested the line and fell both times. The 200-day will be a line of resistance for the broad index when it rebounds.

Market conditions also matter. When the market is in correction, a breakdown below the 200-day line is more likely to result in a further drawdown for even leadership stocks.

What if you could choose your talents but only get half a loaf?

You could have excellent stock- picking skills or top-notch defensive strategies but not both.

If you had to choose one, defense would be the way to go.

Good stock-pickers will turn into boom-and-bust stories if they don't understand defense. But a stout defense will keep you out of weak situations and help you cash in winners before much of the gain is lost.

An investor who doesn't know how to sell based on chart action is taking huge and unnecessary risks.

This is especially true when a company turns out to be reporting phony numbers. By the time the scandal breaks, it's too late to sell without significant damage.

China-based **Longtop Financial Technologies** ([LFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LFT)) debuted on the NYSE in October 2007. A vicious bear market was about to begin.

Longtop broke out on the follow-through day of March 12, 2009. In the prior three quarters, the company reported EPS gains of 36%, 35% and 52%. The stock rose 113%, peaking in January 2010. An investor could've sold when the stock fell below its 10-week moving average in the week ended Jan. 22 **1**.

The drop below the 10-week line wasn't the first sell signal. The stock made a new high in weak volume and then slid 6% in triple volume (seen only on the daily chart).

A new buy point of 40.96 emerged after the stock formed a new base **2**. The breakout came in the week ended Nov. 5, 2010 **3**. Most investors would've sold three days later when the stock fell 7.9% below the ideal buy point **4**. It was the start of a long, steady slide.

Investors with solid chart-reading skills would've been out of the stock. And they would've stayed out because the stock never formed another base.

In late April 2011, website CitronResearch.com described Longtop's financial statements as fraudulent **5**. But the stock was already 43% off its high the day before Citron's accusation. It fell 20% lower on the news.

Some market watchers were unconvinced. On May 4, one analyst said "market misconceptions provide a good entry point for long-term investors" **6**. On May 17, auditors for Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu confirmed that Longtop's numbers were fake. The NYSE halted Longtop trading on the news **7**.

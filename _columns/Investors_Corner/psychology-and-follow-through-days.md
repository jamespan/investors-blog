  How Market Bottoms Rise Amid A Sense Of Doom

The stock market has always liked a good story: rags to riches, mailroom to board room, garage-bred startup to high-tech powerhouse.

  

Maybe that's why market upturns often occur just when headlines seem the most dreadful.

  

A follow-through day takes place within a market correction, after a major index has hit a new low and then held above it for at least three days. It is marked by one or more leading indexes posting a significant gain, typically well over 1%, on increased volume. A follow-through day converts a correction into a rally, confirming a new uptrend.

  

Over the past year, follow-through days have been stirred by relatively good news. Positive or at least dovish comments from the head of the Federal Reserve bank triggered follow-throughs in February and last July. Better-than-anticipated consumer confidence and home price data spurred a follow-through session in May.

  

Plenty of examples also show dire headlines having the same effect.

  

"Big Indexes Confirm Rally As War Looms" was IBD's Big Picture headline on March 18, 2003, a day after a Day 4 follow-through triggered on March 17. The Iraq War was days away, with President George W. Bush telling Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein to leave the country. Secretary of State Colin Powell told reporters that Saddam "has had his chance."

  

The market dipped quietly at the open of Monday, March 17, then turned and rallied.

  

Rallying tech stocks drove the Nasdaq ahead 3.9%. The S&P 500 gained 3.5%. Volume was above the prior day's levels, and above average, up 17% on the Nasdaq and 7% on the NYSE.

  

The session marked a follow-through day on the fourth day of its rally attempt. From there, the S&P 500 rallied 29% to year-end.

  

Here's another example: In the second half of 2008 and early 2009, the financial crisis was in full effect. Credit markets were frozen. Financial and housing stocks were in a world of hurt.

  

But on March 12, 2009, the S&P 500 surged 4.1% **(1)** in higher volume **(2)** on the fifth day of its rally attempt.

  

Financial news for the day was good. Early in the week, **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **JPMorgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) had delivered profitable results for the first two months of the year. **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) followed suit on the day of the rally.

  

Even bad news had little effect. Standard & Poor's downgraded **General Electric**'s ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) credit rating. But the cut wasn't as bad as feared. Investors reacted by sending GE shares up 13%.

  

Again, the headlines did little to guide traders as to investor sentiment or where the market was heading. Daily price and volume action on the major indexes told the real tale.

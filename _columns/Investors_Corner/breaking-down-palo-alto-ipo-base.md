Initial public offerings receive a lot of leeway from chart readers. Because they are young and tend to be wild and unpredictable, they can often thrash out big gains. Many times, the first bases formed by newly public stocks are shorter than the usual seven-week minimum for a cup with handle, or five weeks for a flat base.

  

They can be more volatile than proper bases, too.

  

These can be called IPO bases because they are a bit different than normal bases.

  

Because new issues can be explosive winners, it pays off to buy on their breakouts.

  

There is also a tendency among new issues to form IPO bases, tumble, then form long bases that lead to big price gains.

  

One patience-testing newbie launched in 2012 was **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)).

  

Security software was already a buzzword.

  

But competition was harsh among those fighting to become the industry's next standard brands.

  

A volatile first session on July 20 left Palo Alto 27% above its IPO price of 42 a share.

  

It paused for a few weeks as it formed a short consolidation of 13 days **(1)**.

  

That's way too short for any proper base, but for an IPO stock with strong fundamentals, it was adequate.

  

Price action was volatile, which is usually a negative but common with new issues.

  

Palo Alto broke out past a 62.17 buy point, but volume was light.

  

Shares climbed as much as 17% from the entry until it peaked a few weeks after the breakout **(2)**.

  

The stock consolidated for 18 months before it finally climbed to a new high in February 2014.

  

Palo Alto broke out Feb. 6, 2014, from what could be interpreted as a handle in a long, irregular pattern **(3)**.

  

The next month, Palo Alto started forming its first regular base.

  

Shares consolidated for 12 weeks, but the breakout quickly failed. Palo Alto formed a shorter base, and this time the breakout was a success **(4)**.

  

Investors who donned their cloak of patience and kept an eye on Palo Alto through its long gestation have been rewarded with a gain of about 80% since August 2014.

  

The stock is in an uptrend, still showing no signs of weakness.

  

To be sure, there are IPO bases that fail and never come back. 

  

**Arcos Dorados** ([ARCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCO)) is a good example. After clearing a 14-week base, the breakout failed and the stock remains depressed.

  

In another case, **Noodles & Co.** ([NDLS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NDLS)) never quite broke out of its first base and also is in a severe correction.

  

That's why it's important to cut losses short with any stock purchase.

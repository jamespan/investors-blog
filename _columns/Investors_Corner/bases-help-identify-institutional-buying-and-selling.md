  Bases Have Different Looks But Share Many Similarities

Investor's Corner has covered the major chart patterns you need to know to find a great stock on the verge of launching a big move up. The cup with handle, double bottom, ascending base and base on base all differ.


Yet these and other bases share many similarities. If you know how to spot these common traits, your chances of picking stock winners will rise dramatically.


The healthiest consolidations show smooth price action with mild price declines. Tight action as a stock trades sideways, for example, is a sign of support. When the market pulls back 15% to 20%, a cup-shaped base that corrects 25% to 30% from the base's high to low is reasonable.


Wide-and-loose bases with erratic price swings reveal uncertainty and a lack of support, and that's never good for stock.


Boring price action is good as a base forms, but price action should be exciting at the breakout with a big percentage gain in strong volume.


While many like to dismiss the significance of analyzing price and volume in a base, it's a worthwhile endeavor for growth investors because it's a way to detect heavy institutional buying in a stock. This is the fuel for a big gain. Bases marred by repeated institutional selling should generally be avoided.


The base-building process for a stock is the law of supply and demand at work. Finding a company with big earnings and sales growth is one thing, but are institutional investors accumulating the stock? If so, you're looking at a potential leader.


Bases are also similar in that they tend to complete around the time the market is getting ready to start a new uptrend.


Soon after the Nasdaq's follow-through day on March 5, 2013, **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) cleared a flat base with a 91.57 buy point. Trading was tight in the 11-week base. The correction from high to low was a modest 10%. Whipsaw action in the market soon followed, but Actavis powered higher, showing nine straight weekly price gains.


After some distribution days and whipsaw action in the major averages, the market uptrend resumed on April 29. It was **YY**'s ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) turn to break out from a well-formed, cup-shaped base.


It cleared a 20.99 buy point May 6 in booming trade. YY proved resilient in late June when it pierced its 10-week moving average, then closed above the line in heavy trade. The Chinese social networking and music play ran up 333% by March of this year.

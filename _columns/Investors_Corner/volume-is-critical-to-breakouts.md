While many IBD 50 stocks have cleared buy points the past few weeks, big winners have been few.

  

Those that are sporting respectable gains have one common denominator: They all broke out in heavy volume.

  

Volume is your best gauge of demand and is a crucial characteristic of a breakout. Trading should be at least 40% above average when a stock clears a buy point. Remember, you want to see a wave of buyers hit the stock, not just a trickle.

  

It's hard to tell the final volume tally until after the close, but you estimate it by comparing the stock's volume at any point during the session with its average. Better yet, you can get a computer-generated estimate of final volume by getting a quote at Investors.com.

  

**Hansen Natural** ([HANS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HANS)) is up 12% since clearing an 82.10 entry in a cup-with-handle base Aug. 23. Turnover jumped to more than twice its average on the breakout.

  

Deep-discount retailer **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) gapped above a handle in a double-bottom base Aug. 30. It broke out in nearly triple its average volume and is up 11%.

  

Rival **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) is up about 7% after clearing a 70.64 buy point in nearly twice its average trade Aug. 29.

  

**Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) blew past a 41.10 square-box buy point in almost double its normal turnover Aug. 30 . It's now up 9%.

  

**MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) initially cleared a 340.52 square-box trigger Sept. 8, but volume was lackluster. It again cleared the 340.52 buy point Thursday as trade jumped 50% above average â€” a much more convincing level of trading.

  

Higher turnover on a weekly chart also can tell you there's demand for a stock at a breakout.

  

Some IBD 50 stocks are still basing. Farm gear retailer **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) scored its first gain in above-average volume in more than two months. It has a 73.19 buy point. Its Relative Strength line is at a new high.

  

Chip designer **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) also rallied in heavy volume last week. It's forming a base with a 39.55 buy point.

  

The IBD 50 stocks lagged the market as a whole. Thirty-five components rose. The average weekly gain for the entire list was 2.2%.

  

By comparison, the Nasdaq jumped 6.3% last week and the S&P 500 5.4%.

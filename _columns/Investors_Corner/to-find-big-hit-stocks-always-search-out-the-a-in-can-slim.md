What do musicians Johnny Lee, Vanilla Ice and Sinead O'Connor have in common? They've all had one or two big hits, but have since faded from the spotlight. They simply don't have the long-term record of hot tracks that Beyonce, U2, Adele or Katy Perry do.


The point? When looking for the best growth companies in which to invest, you don't want ones that are just one- or two-hit wonders.


A company might be able to muster one or two quarters of solid bottom-line growth. But it's best to see several years of strong profit growth.


Top-notch earnings growth is essential fuel for a high-performance stock. If the company isn't making money year after year, there's virtually no reason for the stock to go up.


Before you decide to invest, always see whether your target firms have boosted earnings at respectable rates the past several years.


The strong annual earnings growth is the [A in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). You don't have to go back 10 or 20 years. IBD checks the past three to five years. Earnings growth should be up at least 25% in each of those years. Some of the market's biggest winners have annual earnings growth of 50%, 100% or higher — and that's *before* their stocks make big gains!


When scouting potential stock investments, insist on those with solid annual profit growth as well as robust quarterly figures.


The accompanying table shows current members of the IBD 50 as of Monday's close; all of these names are expected to increase full-year earnings per share by 20% or more.

In "How To Make Money In Stocks," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote, "It's the combination of strong earnings in the last several quarters plus a record of solid growth in the recent years that creates a superb stock, or at least one with a higher probability of success during an uptrending general market."


In-home nursing care provider **Almost Family** ([AFAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFAM))'s profit grew 56%, 65% and 73% from 2005 to 2007.


Despite a tough year for the overall market, Almost Family was one of the best stocks of 2008. It advanced 131%.


In April 2005, internet kingpin and Google owner **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) bolted out of a cup-with-handle base. It gained more than 60% in three months before settling into another consolidation. Google's annual earnings growth was well above the 25% minimum. From 2002 to 2004, the search engine's profit surged 1,733%, 138% and 92%.


And finally, in 2009 **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) was one of the top-performing stocks that year, gaining 213%. From 2006 to 2008, the Chinese search firm's earnings per share grew 313%, 101% and 91%.


To find annual growth rates for companies, you can compute the figures from annual reports or earnings statements. IBD's EPS Rating gives you a quick snapshot, though.


 You can also find a firm's three-year earnings growth rate by checking the minicharts in the IBD Weekly print edition or the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) tool in the Research section of Investors.com.
In The [Data Tables section](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) of Investors.com, you can see a company's key ratings by finding its industry sector within the Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables. Each stock is part of one of 33 broad industry sectors, which in turn are ranked by strongest to weakest.

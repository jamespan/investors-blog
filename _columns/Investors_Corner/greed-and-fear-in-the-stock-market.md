The twin emotions of fear and greed rule the market. But to be a successful investor, they can't rule you.

Taking emotions out of your buy and sell decisions is, in the end, impossible. We are emotional beings. Our hopes and dreams are, to some extent, tied to our investing success. But the best way to divorce your emotions from your trades is to have a set of valid rules and follow them ruthlessly.

Here are a few examples of sound rules.

You don't buy until there's a follow-through day. You don't buy until a stock that meets CAN SLIM criteria breaks out. Then, once it breaks out, you don't buy when it's extended (see the chart of **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) in 2013 on this page). Take the majority of your profits when they are 20% to 25%. Adhere to sell rules. Above all, cut your losses at 7% to 8%.

Greed comes into play during bull markets. Success feeds on itself. Confidence builds. You fall in love with a winning trade. "Starbucks is going to put my kids through college," you think. But maybe Starbucks should have been sold for a 20% gain. Instead, it might end up making a round trip, sold for no profit at all.

You will often become most confident when the market is nearing a top. After all, you've had months of success. You may have struggled in past markets with CAN SLIM's strategy, but now, you tell yourself, you finally understand the system. Nothing can go wrong.

It's not just individual investors who feel this. The pros are prisoners of the same emotions. That's why sentiment indicators like the put-call ratio and the Investors Intelligence weekly poll of bulls and bears are contrarian barometers. An extreme peak of optimism is seen at market tops.

At market tops, everything falls into place. Every stock you hold is in an uptrend. You might have a month with a 10% gain or occasionally a week with a 10% gain. Those are the times to be most careful — and even take at least some profits — because once markets top, they retreat quickly. At these moments, it's hard to sell.

When you feel supremely confident in your ability, you might actually be overconfident.

It's time to step back and take a close look at the market and your stocks. Is the number of distribution days — when the market is down on volume greater than the previous day — piling up? Are your stocks, or other leading stocks, going into climax runs or triggering other sell signals? If yes, it might be time to take money off the table.

One way to keep the feelings of greed and pride in check is to not talk about your stocks or your performance. If you're having a good year, keep it to yourself. Avoid telling friends how much you're up in your top performers.

Also, know yourself. Every investor has psychological weaknesses. Understand yours and overcome them.

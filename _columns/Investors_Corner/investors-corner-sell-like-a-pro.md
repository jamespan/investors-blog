**How To Sell Winners Like A Pro II:** [Fifth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/special-report/623411-sell-like-a-pro-ii-defense.aspx)

  

You want to look for what's new as you evaluate any stock.

  

When searching for a stock to buy, the fresh development could be a new CEO, a new product or new industry conditions. With that in mind, the "N" in IBD's CAN SLIM investing strategy stands for "new."

  

However, don't forget that it's not just when you're establishing an initial position in a stock that you should look for what's new. You also want to remember the "N" factor when you're deciding whether or not to sell a stock.

  

That new product (or the new CEO) could be a dud. Or the new industry conditions could be terrible. Or the market is showing a new trend — to the downside following a flurry of distribution.

  

Another thing to keep in mind is that in many cases, it doesn't help to own the No. 1 stock in the industry group when a new development is clearly negative.

  

Even the most highly rated stocks in the group will hit obvious sell signals, just like the laggards and the mediocre names. It doesn't matter if you own the very best stock, or one that's actually trying to break out and buck the negative trend. It's simply time to sell.

  

The sell signals could include group leaders slicing through their 50-day moving averages in huge turnover. Or their late-stage breakouts are faltering fast.

  

In 2008, the major Wall Street bank stocks provided a dramatic example of when it made sense to bail out without hesitation as an entire group crashed.

  

Of course, you might have felt that **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) was the best of the bunch, and therefore it would be smart to hold onto it. In fact, one fund manager pointed out to IBD around the middle of 2008 that some financials still had strong fundamentals.

  

The earnings potential of many firms was weakened by troubled holdings related to subprime mortgages, the manager said in an interview for an August 2008 article in the Mutual Funds section. But some of these firms were being punished for the sins of other financials.

  

The problem with that view was that you didn't know how much everyone would get punished.

  

Even if you think your stock is a lone bright spot in a horrible world, are you willing to stick with it as it continues to get hammered unjustly? What if that means an unwarranted drop of 25%? Or what about 50% to 80%?

  

The fact is, an entire industry group had fallen out of favor in this case. Even Goldman cratered throughout the second half of 2008, hitting an all-time low of 47.41, 81% below its 250.70 peak. The stock eventually recovered, rallying with the general market after the big follow-through day on March 9, 2009. But at 106 today, it's still well off its high.

  

You would have been better off acting upon its many sell signals, even though it was an industry leader that survived the financial crisis — unlike Lehman Brothers, WaMu or Bear Stearns.

  

Goldman's sell signals included a major break through the 200-day moving average and this line's turn lower. In late October 2007, the stock failed to make much headway after clearing a cup base. Goldman soon triggered the 8%-loss sell rule for new buyers.

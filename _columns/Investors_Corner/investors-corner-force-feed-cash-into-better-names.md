*Eleventh In A Series*

  

Investors simply can't buy every top-ranked stock that breaks out from a base. They must be choosy.

  

That's where portfolio management comes in. Because capital is a limited resource, investors need to rotate cash into the best-performing stocks if they want to make big gains in their portfolios.

  

In "How to Make Money in Stocks", IBD Chairman and founder William J. O'Neil shares a story about a dress retailer whose red dresses are flying off the racks. But his green dresses are seeing only mild demand, while his yellow dresses are not selling at all.

  

The correct thing to do? Mark down the green and yellow ones to sell them fast. Use the money to buy additional red dresses to sell.

  

Investors should manage their portfolio in the same way. Let's say the market is in a new uptrend and you have four stocks in your portfolio. One stock is up 15% and another is up 10%. But the other two are flat to slightly lower from where you bought in.

  

The two laggard stocks need to be sold to make better use of your capital. If the trade isn't working and you've given it significant time, don't hesitate to cut it loose.

  

Put more money to work in your better-performing stocks if they set up secondary buying opportunities such as pullbacks to the 10-week moving average or three-weeks-tight patterns.

  

Even if we're not in a rip-roaring bull market, there will be better opportunities out there. The market always has stocks that have a great product or service, superb earnings and sales growth and excellent share strength. So why be stuck in a Pinto when you can ride in a Porsche?

  

November 2009 IPO **Ancestry.com** ([ACOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACOM)) cleared a 21.45 buy point in a base-on-base pattern in the week ended Sept. 24 **1**.

  

Unlike the breakout from the first breakout attempt **2**, the second breakout worked right away. Buyers took little heat.

  

The stock jumped 32% by late October before settling into a three-weeks-tight pattern. This was a potential place to add shares. It cleared the setup in late November **3** and bolted 80% by early 2011 **4**.

As the late Yogi Berra would have said, is it deja vu all over again? **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is in trouble with Consumer Reports, and it echoes a PR crisis that the product watchdog created several years ago for another well-known company.

Wind your Apple Watch back to 2010.

Replace Tesla with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the Model S with the iPhone 4 and Elon Musk with Steve Jobs.

There's a lesson for investors in these two incidents. When trying to decide whether to hang on to a stock hit by bad news, the daily and weekly charts should be your guide.

The tale told by the Apple chart five years ago and the Tesla chart today are vastly different. It was a mere speed bump for Apple. But it appears so far to be a tree fallen across the road for Tesla.

Soon after the June 24, 2010, release of the iPhone 4, bloggers were writing that it dropped calls if held a certain way. The incident became known as antennagate.

Apple's response? Jobs famously told one griper, "Just avoid holding it in that way."

On July 12, Consumer Reports posted an article confirming the problem and said it couldn't recommend the phone for purchase. On July 16, Jobs held a news conference refuting CR's contentions.

The day after the Consumer Reports story on the iPhone 4 was published, Apple stock dropped 2% to end at 251.80. Volume that day was heavy, 46% above average. Despite that bad day, Apple traded less than 10% below an all-time peak of 279.01. The stock fell a bit more over the next few days before recovering the following week.

The stock market had been correcting through the summer.

Then a new rally began around Labor Day. Apple went on to build a new base, break out and help lead the rally.

Antennagate was quickly forgotten.

In October, Apple reported fiscal Q4 results that blew away results. It recorded iPhone sales at 14.1 million, up 91% from a year earlier. From July 16, 2010, to Sept. 21, 2012, shares gained 186%.

Fast-forward to last month.

On Oct. 20, Consumer Reports said the Model S electric car was unreliable and that it had gotten too many complaints from buyers. Just two months ago, CR noted the top-end \$127,820 model was so good, it [broke the rating system](http://news.investors.com/technology/102015-776463-tesla-motors-stock-falls-on-model-s-reliability.htm?ntt=TSLA).

Tesla stock tried to break out of a base July 20 of this year, but it failed. Even before Consumer Reports panned the car, the stock was trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

There is no reason an investor should own a stock performing that badly.

One more consideration: Apple was hugely profitable and growing by leaps and bounds. Tesla is still a money loser, although it's currently expected to earn \$1.95 a share in 2016.

After the Consumer Reports slam at midday Oct. 20, Tesla shares tumbled, closing down 6.6% in volume 217% above average, the biggest volume since Feb. 12.

A skilled chart reader can see that institutional investors have been active sellers of [Tesla](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY); big investors were buyers of Apple in 2010. You can determine that by watching volume and price in the two stocks.

  Why Should You Use IBD's RS Rating?

Sure, Uncle Angelo doing push-ups with your cousins straddling his back is one sort of relative strength. But relative strength in the market is a whole other thing.


One gauge of relative strength you can find in IBD is the RS line, a vital investor tool. The line generally runs along stock charts just above the vertical volume bars, and just below the stock's price bars in [blue on the charts available at](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) Investors.com.


The RS line shows how a stock's price action is performing vs. the S&P 500. A rising line shows the stock outperforming the broader market. A declining line indicates the stock is a laggard.


IBD's SmartSelect ratings take the concept of relative strength a step further via the RS Rating. The highest score of 99 shows a stock has outperformed 99% of all other publicly traded U.S. stocks over the past 12 months. A score of 1 shows it is underperforming 99% of those stocks.


In the search for leading stocks, you'd like to find one with an RS Rating of at least 80. At the start of a new bull market, an 85 or 90 or even higher is better.


The RS rank can dip as a stock is basing, particularly if the base is deep and long. Some excellent bases may form over one year or longer, but that can push down the stock's RS to 60 or lower.


So far, that's not the case for **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)), No. 15 in Friday's IBD 50 (see the list daily at [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/)). A base has been brewing since August, yet Ellie's RS is still quite strong at 88.


You would like to see the RS line move into new high ground just ahead of, or alongside a highly rated stock's breakout. The combination of a rising RS Rating and the RS line jumping to new highs corroborates the strength of the breakout.


While sorting through candidates for your watch list, focus on all of the SmartSelect categories in search of broad-based strength. Study the number of bases that have already formed. You want to catch a leader early in its run, not late. A strong RS Rating alone means little.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) started 2015 weak on most IBD ratings fronts. But just ahead of its July 13 breakout (please see a daily chart), its RS Rating had climbed to a 93 **(1)** .


On Oct. 15 **(2)**, when the stock began a strong move out of a new cup with handle at 549.88, the RS advanced to a 98.


The e-commerce titan's RS line had also steadily advanced to new highs since July.

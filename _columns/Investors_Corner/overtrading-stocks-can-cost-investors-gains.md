Finding too many attractive stocks isn't a bad problem to have. But being too active could be damaging to a portfolio.

  

Trying to hop in and out of a stock repeatedly in order to chase potential profits or protect your capital may sound like a good strategy. Some investors may keep jumping from one stock to the next because they keep finding new compelling ideas.

  

But by doing so, they might miss a stock's major move â€” often a minimum gain of 20% to 25%. It can take a lot of trades and many small gains to rack up a 20% return.

  

And even if trading commissions are a fraction of what they used to cost in the past, they can still add up .

  

Still, others may engage in day trading, which involves buying and selling multiple stocks on the same day. Most investors lose money doing this, IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil says. Why?

  

"The reason is simple: You are dealing predominantly with minor daily fluctuations that are harder to read than basic trends over a longer time period," he writes in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "Don't try to make money so fast. Rome wasn't built in a day."

  

Overtrading can also leave investors vulnerable to trading during tough times in the market, such as a correction or whipsaw activity. And juggling too many stocks may dilute precious time that investors could otherwise use to research the best stocks in the market.

  

Instead of spreading your capital around in multiple stocks, target only the leading candidates and make sure the market is behaving properly. The best time to buy stocks is when a confirmed uptrend starts.

  

IBD offers readers plenty of resources for stock ideas in The [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/top10/default.aspx&src=AURLBGZ), Stocks On The Move, [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing/stock-spotlight.htm) and other lists and columns. Many of the stocks featured in these sections meet certain fundamental and technical criteria.

  

Create a watch list from these leading stocks, then continue to follow earnings reports and other news, and keep track of their price action on the daily and weekly charts. Many of these are stocks that have the potential to rise upward of 20%.

  

The chart above shows the potential gains that can be had if you focus on one or two leaders. **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) broke out from a cup base in August 2013 and surged 117% in 10 months before pausing to start a new base.

Read [The Big Picture](http://leaderboard.investors.com/thebigpicture/&src=AURLBGZ) and the accompanying Market Pulse every day to stay on top of what's going on in the market. The Market Pulse shows if the market is in a confirmed uptrend, if the uptrend is under pressure or if the market is weak and in a correction.

  

Breakouts tend to work best during a confirmed uptrend. Start by concentrating your buying power in one or two high-quality stocks. You can add shares at secondary buy points or fresh breakouts if they continue to act well.

  

If the uptrend goes under pressure, be cautious about taking new positions or adding shares. It may be a better time to lock in profits and cut losses. Put the brakes on buys and stay mostly in cash when the market is in correction.

  

It's always best to trade more actively when the market is rewarding investors for taking risks.

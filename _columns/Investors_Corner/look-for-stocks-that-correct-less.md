Virtually all bases begin with a down week that's often followed by further declines before the stock finally gets its footing and moves higher. But some declines within a base are better than others.

The best stocks usually shape bases that show mild corrections compared to their peers or to the market as a whole. That's because institutional-class funds will step in to buy stocks they believe have the potential to go higher, while allowing less promising stocks to wallow.

During a market correction, the major indexes may fall anywhere from 5% to 25% from their 52-week highs, or even more. You can expect leading stocks fall one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half times that amount.

So if the S&P 500 drops 10%, then it's normal for a top-rated stock to fall 15% to 25%. But what if it only falls 12% or 13% from its peak? That's a subtle sign of strength; institutions don't appear so eager to sell shares.

**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) was one of the stocks that held up relatively well as the market headed into a correction in late June to early July 2010. Chipotle was at the vanguard of a shift to so-called fast-casual restaurants that offer fresh, high-quality ingredients at a price above fast-food shops but below traditional sit-down diners.

The company was posting strong profit growth at the time. It ranked 6th in the IBD 100, which in 2011 became the IBD 50.

Investors no doubt recognized the company's underlying strengths, reflected by best-possible 99 Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings. The stock's 94 Relative Price Strength Rating meant that it was outperforming 94% off all listed companies.

Such strong fundamental and technical indicators had propelled Chipotle to the top of the restaurant industry, which over the prior seven months had jumped more than 100 places to No. 30 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.

Furthermore, the broader retail sector was ranked 4th out of 33 IBD industry sectors in early July as the stock began shaping a cup-with-handle base.

Chipotle's base corrected just 18%, just a little more than the S&P 500. It was less than other group leaders such as **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) and **Texas Roadhouse** ([TXRH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TXRH)), which formed bases at about the same time and corrected 21% and 26%, respectively. **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)), another top stock in the group, fell 35% in price.

**A Great Base**

Other bullish signs included an upside reversal at the bottom of Chipotle's base in the heaviest volume within the pattern **(1)**. A proper downward-slanting handle was formed by a mild pullback in light volume.

The buy point was at 154.53, or 10 cents above the peak of the handle, which Chipotle cleared in healthy volume during the week ended Sept. 3. The stock went on to rise for 12 out of 13 weeks, hitting a new high of 262.77 in the week ended Dec. 3.

From there, Chipotle shaped a series of base-on-base patterns featuring mild corrections en route to a peak of 442.40 in the week ended April 13, 2012, before correcting to form a much deeper base. In the two years from the Sept. 1, 2010 breakout, Chipotle nearly tripled.

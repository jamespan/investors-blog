Whether it be a cup, saucer or a [double-bottom pattern](http://research.investors.com/ibd-charts.aspx?cht=pvc&type=daily&symbol=0NDQC) like the chart of **CyberArk** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) recently. The stock formed a six-day handle from April 8 to 15, giving a buy point at 63.08. On the weekly chart, it was nearly impossible to see that a handle had formed. But it was clear on the daily chart. The rally was choppy, but CyberArk climbed 9% after clearing the handle April 16.

Third, volume should be quiet in the handle. Below-average turnover in the handle area tells you that professionals are not dumping shares as the stock retreats from a recent high.

There are some pitfalls that investors need to watch out for in a handle. Since a handle is a pullback, it should drift downward along the price lows. A bit of sideways action is okay; upward-wedging handles, however, are faulty, since they don't allow the stock to pull back to digest its gains. The wedging action also implies that demand is weak rather than robust.

A handle should form in the upper half of a stock's base. Handles that form low in the base still have lots of selling resistance to work through. Perform the midpoint test. Add the high and low in the base, and divide by 2. Then jot down the result. Next, add the high and low in the handle and divide by 2. For it to pass the midpoint test, the latter figure should be larger.

Finally, a handle should form above the stock's 10-week moving average. This is also to make sure that the handle doesn't form too low in the base.

From July to August last year, **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) formed a large cup-with-handle base with a 166.39 buy point. The handle spanned more than 40 trading sessions, so it met the time minimum. But the handle corrected nearly 21%, a key flaw **(1)**. Plus, it featured multiple down weeks in heavy volume **(2)**.

The stock cleared the handle in the week ended Sept. 5. Although volume was big that week, Jazz rose only 6% before losing steam. In the week that ended Oct. 3, the stock fell nearly 10% below the 166.39 entry, triggering IBD's key 8% sell rule **(3)**.

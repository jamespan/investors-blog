An ax can be either a useful tool or a dangerous weapon. In stock charts, the 50-day moving average has a similar dual nature.

The 50-day moving average takes a stock's prior 50 daily price closes and averages them. Do this every day in an upward-trending stock, and you'll get a line on a chart that runs below the stock's price bars while smoothing out the jumps and buckles.

The line serves a startling number of uses. When a stock is basing, a cup base with more than half its bulk above rather than below the line is a sign of health. Another sign of a stock's strength: a flat base that finds "support" at its 50-day line.

What is support? Institutional investors often use the 50-day or 10-week line as a reference point, stepping in to add shares to their positions when a stock pulls back to the moving average. This buying creates upward pressure — or price support — to help keep the stock's prices above that moving average.

## Spotting Follow-On Buy Points

This is why rising stocks often rebound from their 50-day lines, turning brief pullbacks into [follow-on buying opportunities](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). It is also why 50-day and 10-week moving averages tend to cradle advances that can run across many months.

On the dangerous side, a rallying stock that collapses below 50-day support in heavy volume is often sending a sell signal. Once below that line, institutional investors may use the 50-day line to mark a sell level. Short sellers may use the line as a level at which to sell shares short.

These forces create a level of resistance. Stocks often need a large boost of buying power to muscle back above their 50-day lines after losing that level of support.

There are other, similar moving averages. Most common is the 10-week moving average. This line tracks a stock's weekly closes over the prior 10 weeks. It generally tracks fairly close to the 50-day line. So if you are reading a daily chart, use the 50-day line. If you're analyzing a weekly chart, use the 10-week.

There is a similar relationship between the long-term 200-day and 40-week averages. On a daily chart, use the 200-day. On a weekly chart, it's the 40-week line.

## The 50-Day Moving Average And ORLY Stock

In an uptrending stock, the 200-day and 40-week averages will generally track well below the 50-day and 10-week lines, respectively.

When a stock consolidates its gains for an extended period, the 50-day or 10-week line will sometimes cross and pass below the longer-term averages.

**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) broke out of a nine-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) at 94.98 in the week ended Feb. 8, 2013. The base formed near or above its 10-week moving average.

The auto parts chain climbed 64% through February 2014. It ran up neatly and followed the rules of 10-week line etiquette.

The stock found support near or at the line **(1)** twice within several months of the breakout, [offering entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) for holders to buy more shares.

O'Reilly slipped below the line in light trade in September 2014, but it was not a sell signal. The rally continued through the fall of 2015. In early 2017, the stock began a deep correction, [resetting the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/).

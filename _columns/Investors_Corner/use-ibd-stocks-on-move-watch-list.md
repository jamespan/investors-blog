Investing takes diligence, and that includes always working on your watch list of stocks.

IBD provides all sorts of features to help you find promising issues to add to your list.

This Investor's Corner column will look at a couple of them: Stocks On The Move and Stock Spotlight.

Stocks On The Move appears both at Investors.com and in the print edition (today on B1). A weekly version runs in the IBD 50 special on Mondays.

It's a list that changes with each day. It highlights the stocks with the greatest percentage increases in volume above their average daily level over the past 50 days. Focus on those with EPS and RS ratings of 80 or higher.

Usually, these increases indicate buying or selling by the big institutional investors who really have the power to move the market.

The list's online version is updated continuously during the trading day, while the print version is compiled just once — after the market's close.

Beyond increases in volume, Stocks On The Move picks out stocks based on other criteria as well, such as a price change of half a point or more and a stock price of at least 16 for the Nasdaq or 20 for the NYSE.

Keep an eye on the stocks making the cut. You'll often find issues with strong ratings that are building the right side of a base — in other words, promising watch list candidates.

Meanwhile, [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/Article/596545/201201031731/late-stage-bases-showing-up-aapl-iaci.htm) consists of a column accompanied by charts for 16 stocks — eight from the Nasdaq and eight from the NYSE.

It doesn't change as much every day, since it's not specifically focused on increases in daily volume like Stocks On The Move.

Rather, this feature screens for stocks with strong earnings and sales that are working on new bases or staging breakouts.

The Stock Spotlight column generally discusses one or more issues that have made the lineup, providing some fundamental and technical analysis.

The table that appears next to this column features stocks that have appeared lately in the Stocks On The Move or Stock Spotlight lineups. Use this as a guide to using these two features to put together a watch list consisting of highly rated names.

Many investors believe the key metric for any stock is its price-earnings ratio, but IBD has always begged to differ.

Why? Investors steering clear of high P-E ratios often end up missing out on big winners.

History provides plenty of examples of winners sporting high P-Es at the breakout and throughout much of the long advance.

**Google's** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) P-E was in the 50s and 60s as it ran up from September 2004 through January 2006. Another search king, China's **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), also was on the "expensive" side as the stock charged ahead in 2009 through 2011.

Going further back, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) also looked pricey during their periods of greatest market performance. So did **America Online** ([AOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOL)), Genentech (now owned by **Roche** ([RHHBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHHBY)) and **Xerox** ([XRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRX)) in their heydays.

"The fact is, investors with a bias against what they consider to be high P-Es will miss out on some of the greatest opportunities of this or any other time," wrote William J. O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, in his best-seller "How to Make Money in Stocks."

"During bull markets, in particular, such a bias could literally cost you a fortune."

One thing to keep in mind is that big winners generally post huge increases in earnings. So it's no surprise that IBD has found that over the course of a winner's long run, its superior EPS growth can prevent the trailing 12-month P-E from getting out of hand.

In other words, the P-E may be high at the start, but the earnings quickly catch up with the price, even as the price itself keeps climbing.

Also, remember not to go to the other extreme and search for stocks with high P-E ratios.

Looking pricey isn't necessarily a fatal flaw, but it also isn't a reason to buy a stock no matter what.

Instead, stick with the basics of IBD's CAN SLIM investing strategy — namely, focusing on companies showing strong growth in profit and revenue for the current quarter and on an annual basis.

"If you look down a list of the market's biggest winners year in and year out, you'll instantly see the relationship between booming profits and booming stocks," wrote O'Neil in his book.

You won't see as strong of a relationship between P-E and performance. Nonetheless, many investors have continued to fixate on the P-E ratio.

For example, in a strong industry group, some investors will be scared off from buying the group's clear leader because it has a high P-E. They'll flock to one of the group's laggards, drawn by their low P-Es. O'Neil has called this a "faulty use of P-E ratios" that afflicts "amateurs and professionals alike."

These folks frequently "evaluate the stocks in an industry and conclude the one selling at the cheapest P-E is always undervalued and therefore the most attractive purchase," he wrote.

"The reality is, the lowest P-E usually belongs to the company with the most ghastly earnings record."

O'Neil says in his book that a stock selling at, say, seven times its earnings typically does so because its overall record is more deficient than that of a stock with a higher ratio.

Stocks usually sell near what they're worth, he wrote.

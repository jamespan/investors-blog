Remember back before DVRs allowed you to fast-forward past commercials or pause your programming? If you were watching an exciting show, the commercial break was your opportunity to think about the clues to solve the mystery, catch your breath from the action, or even just go get a snack. [Consider the flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) as the commercial break for successful investors in top growth stocks.




The flat base is one of the more common patterns encountered among the biggest winners among top growth stocks of each market cycle.


In a computer-generated pattern recognition study going back to 1963, one-third of the bases among a large set of big market winners fell into the [flat base category](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


**Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) showed excellent flat-base characteristics in its three-month base that started in November 2009.



Flat bases tend to be shallow, correcting no more than 15% from the base's high to low. In Dollar Tree's case, the drop was 11%.


The shallow correction testifies that institutions are unwilling to give up shares. In fact, institutions may even be using the correction to pick up shares as the stock comes down, absorbing any selling with quiet accumulation.


A Brief Chart Pattern, Time-Wise, For Hot Growth Stocks
-------------------------------------------------------


The required minimum length of the flat base is five weeks — shorter than the seven weeks of the cup with handle or double bottom. Start counting weeks in the base with the first down week from a high. If the base appears to be fewer than five weeks on a weekly chart, go to a daily chart and count the number of days including the session in which the stock hits a high and then begins its price correction. A total 25 trading sessions would qualify as a flat base, too.


The week of the [actual breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) is not included (the stock has broken out of the base at that point). Dollar Tree had 12 weeks in its flat base.


As seen in the accompanying weekly chart, the stock seemed to get support each time it fell near 47 **(1)**.

An earlier point of resistance at 51.73, reached on Feb. 3, could have served as an aggressive entry point. The stock broke out strongly, gapping up for a 12% gain in volume 448% above average.


While technical action is a critical component of the timing for a stock purchase, do not neglect your fundamental analysis.


Dollar Tree saw increased sales as people started tightening their belts after the financial crisis of 2008. They had also expanded their refrigerated and freezer section, driving increased traffic.


The company announced earnings-per-share growth of 41% for their fiscal 2009 on record sales over \$5 billion, and that acted as the catalyst for the breakout. It launched a move of more than 200% in the next two years.

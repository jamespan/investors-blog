If a picture is worth a thousand words, a stock chart carries just as much weight for investors â€” if not more.

Stock charts not only provide a wealth of information but can also help investors figure out if a stock is outperforming or underperforming the overall market.

Charts also give vital clues on whether the market's most influential players (mutual funds, banks, insurers and other institutional investors) are buying or selling shares.

Charts even show the right time to buy.

"A stock's price and volume history are recorded on charts to help investors determine whether the stock is strong, healthy, and under accumulation or whether it's weak and behaving abnormally," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil writes in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

A stock chart can give important timing signals, not just price-and-volume action. And the time element is why charts help savvy investors employ good rules.

For instance, a chart may help make it easier to spot when the eight-week [hold rule](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/714274-how-long-should-i-hold-a-stock.htm) kicks in.

Investors should use two types of charts: daily and weekly. The daily chart plots a stock's closing price, as well as its high and low for each day's regular session. In a chart on Investors.com, the red bars indicate a down day in price for a stock, while the blue bars mark up days. The hash mark shows the closing price.

The weekly chart displays a stock's weekly price action, with the high, low and closing price for the week. Both charts show volume levels for the day or week.

Learning to read charts can help investors determine the optimal time to buy a stock as well as spot red flags and sell signals. By studying stock charts, they can familiarize themselves with different types of basing patterns and how to calculate a stock's proper buy point.

But where should a novice investor start?

O'Neil's book includes tips and examples to help readers who are new to charts. There are plenty of weekly charts in each day's IBD, including updated chart analysis below each chart in all major features in the paper's "Making Money" section.

In addition to the technical analysis tools, IBD charts offer key fundamental data, including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength ratings. The daily chart also shows the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, while the weekly chart displays the 10-week and 40-week lines.

A chart is just one key component to investing. Just as you shouldn't buy a stock before consulting its chart, don't buy a stock without checking its fundamentals, the news and overall market action.

**Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) provides an example of how charts make it easier to spot bases and stock action. In the weekly chart above, you can see how the stock ran up smoothly after clearing an eight-week flat base at 133.10 in the week ended July 26, 2013.

The stock pulled back to its 10-week moving average the week ended Aug. 30 **(1)** and found support. But this was not a proper entry because the price was lower than the initial breakout. The follow-on entry came a few weeks later **(2)**.

As you can see, without the help of a chart, it would be tough to see the base, buy point, breakout and follow-on buy point.

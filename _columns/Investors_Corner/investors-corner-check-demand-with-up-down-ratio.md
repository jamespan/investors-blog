IBD-style investors go where the action is.

  

In other words, they search for stocks showing accumulation.

  

On a basic level, accumulation refers to up weeks with higher volume. It represents buying by institutional investors who can really lift a stock to new heights.

  

The Investor's Corner that ran in Tuesday's IBD went over accumulation. It covered topics such as counting weeks of net buying and IBD's proprietary Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

Today's column will look at another way to confirm accumulation in a stock's base: its up/down volume ratio.

  

This ratio comes from the past 50 trading days. It divides the total volume on up days by the total volume on down days. A ratio of 1.0 implies an equal amount of buying and selling over the past 50 days.

  

As you might expect, a ratio above 1.0 suggests more buying, while a ratio below 1.0 means more selling.

  

So as you build a watch list, prefer names with an up/down volume ratio of 1.0 or better. Some winners will earn a 2.0 or higher.

  

One place to find this ratio for a stock is within the Stock Checkup tool at Investors.com. Under the Stock Research tab, just click on Stock Checkup and enter a ticker.

  

You'll see the ratio listed in the section labeled "Supply And Demand."

  

The up/down volume ratio is also given within the online stock charts provided by MarketSmith, a sister company of IBD.

  

Using this ratio would have helped any investors studying **Gildan Activewear** ([GIL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIL)) around March 5, 2010.

  

On that day, the T-shirt maker broke out of a cup-with-handle base **1**.

  

The stock ended up staying in a buying range for about a week. It then advanced as much as 30% by late June, though it might have been hard to hold through the Flash Crash on May 6 **2**.

  

You might have seen some areas of concern as you studied Gildan's cup-with-handle base. The cup part of the base had a bit of a straight-up-from-the-bottom quality.

  

The structure also had the same number of weeks of accumulation as distribution. You always prefer to see more weeks of accumulation than distribution.

  

But looking at Gildan's up/down volume ratio would have provided you with some encouragement, perhaps leading you to make a profitable investment in the stock.

  

The Canadian company's ratio had swelled to 1.5 by the time Gildan broke out.

  

That figure implied solid positive demand for the stock over the past 50 days. In this case, the up/down volume ratio served as a useful additional data point.

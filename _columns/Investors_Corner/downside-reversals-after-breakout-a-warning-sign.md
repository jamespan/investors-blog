**SanDisk** ([SNDK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNDK)), a maker of removable memory cards, gave off multiple sell signals before sinking fast in early 2006.

The stock shaped a cup-without-handle base starting in November 2005. The pattern formed after the stock soared 125% from its breakout above a 29.13 buy point of a prior long base.

It's debatable as to whether the new base was a risky fourth-stage pattern or a more hopeful second-stage structure. Your judgment depends on whether you view the nearly two-year-long consolidation that began in November 2003 as having reset SanDisk's base count.

It soon became clear, however, that the new base had flaws that were characteristic of a late-stage pattern.

First, the structure was in a V shape **(1)** as opposed to the smooth, rounded pattern typical of a sound cup base.

Also, the left side of the pattern shows four straight down weeks, including an 11% drop in huge volume during the week ended Nov. 25. From there, it was pretty much straight up from the bottom, which is another flaw.

Overall, the base shows more distribution than accumulation, with high-volume declines **(2)** outnumbering high-volume gains on both the weekly and daily charts.

Many weeks show swings of 10% or more from the weekly high to low, indicating excessive volatility. And the biggest volume can be seen in the declines on the left side of the pattern.

On the positive side, volume was heavy — 13% above the 10-week average, to be exact — on Jan. 3, 2006, as SanDisk cleared the 65.59 buy point.

The stock also had a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 and an Earnings Per Share Rating of 91 on the day of the breakout. Furthermore, the market was in a confirmed uptrend, a key prerequisite to buying any stock.

Yet SanDisk's weaknesses ultimately sealed its fate.

The stock reversed lower in heavy volume **(3)** after hitting a new high in the week ended Jan. 13, 2006. That was followed by two more downside reversals, including one in even heavier volume. After SanDisk's long run-up, this action was a signal to sell at least some shares and take profits.

SanDisk triggered a sell signal in late January, when the stock round-tripped a 22% gain from the 65.59 entry **(4)**. Volume on both the daily and weekly charts was heavy, giving shareholders an added impetus to sell.

After topping, the stock lost more than half its value in a little over six months, hitting a low of 37.34 in the week of July 21, 2006. It didn't recover the Jan. 12, 2006, high of 79.80 until March 20 of this year.

Note that SanDisk broke down even though it still possessed sterling fundamentals and the market remained in a confirmed uptrend.

While fundamental characteristics are paramount when buying a stock, they're often lagging indicators when it comes time to sell: a stock's technical indicators will usually show weakness well before the fundamentals head south.

Cup bases have a lower chance of success than cup-with-handle bases. That's because it's healthy for a stock to have one final shakeout of weak shareholders before breaking out to new highs.

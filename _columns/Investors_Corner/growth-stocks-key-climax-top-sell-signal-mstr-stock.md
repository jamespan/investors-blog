When growth stocks are shooting up like a rocket, it is tough for the amateur to know when it is the best time to hit the ejector seat and lock in profits.




This is why growth investors are always wary over whether their winners could be showing signs of the dreaded climax top. Being able to spot this key signal would have helped **MicroStrategy** ([MSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSTR)) investors lock in gains of around 700% from its late September 2020 breakout, as we'll explain later.


A climax top is when a stock advances so fast in a short period, it exhausts itself and turns lower. A handful of stocks have made this signal in the past few months, following big gains in the 2020 market rally.


How To Spot A Climax Top For Growth Stocks
------------------------------------------


There are a number of important signs that flag a climax top in the offing. These include an exhaustion gap, where a stock suddenly gaps higher after months of gains, or the largest daily point gain appears after a big rally.


The hallmark of a climax is when a stock sees an increase of 25% to 50% in three weeks or less. Usually, this occurs at least 18 weeks following the breakout from a base. The stock's advance suddenly ramps up out of proportion.


The [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-200-day-moving-average/) is also a key indicator. When a stock rises 70% to 100% above its 200-day line, it's giving you a sign of a climax run.


It is important to spot these, because such moves are often followed by a brutal reversal. MarketSmith head Scott St. Clair told Investor's Business Daily the payoffs are massive.


"Climax tops are the best way to lock in gains because the gains are so large if you can capture them," he said. "The problem is they can keep going after you sell, so it is difficult psychologically to sell them, knowing they will likely be higher the next day."


St. Clair suggests a gradual approach to reducing position size to protect gains, while also ensuring one doesn't completely miss out on further upward moves.


For reluctant sellers, he suggests selling 20% of the position every day for five days in a row, or 25% of the position each week for four straight weeks. "This takes the pressure off to get it 'perfect,' " St. Clair said.


This Move Gave Crucial Clues Before Reversal
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ICmstr030821-279x300.jpg)There were rich gains ahead for investors who jumped on MicroStrategy stock after the intelligence software stock passed a large cup-with-handle [buy point of 151.70](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) on Sept. 16, 2020 **(1)**.


By the end of the 18th week following its breakout, it had jumped more than 275%, closing at 577.03.


This is when the move hit warp speed. It rocketed a further 128% from that closing price, or more than 700% above its original buy point, at its zenith **(2)**. This occurred in three weeks, fulfilling another part of the climax-top criteria.


On its climax day of Feb. 9, 2021, it exploded in massive volume, and closed an enormous 461% above its 200-day moving average **(3)**. MicroStrategy stock flashed a further warning sign by gapping up on this day.


Those who took this as a sign to take their money off the table will have made substantial gains on their initial investment. Those who clung on would have been forced to watch in horror as it gave up half its value from its highs to its recent lows.

While [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) is recognized as IBD's signature market analysis column, it has an important companion in what many readers know simply as the chart page.

Formally called "What's The Market Trend?," the page shows 10-month daily charts of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 — the two indexes with most bearing on the general market — plus other indexes and details that paint a comprehensive picture of the broad market.

Each element of the page offers an insight into the market, and today we'll explain how to use and interpret those parts.

On the index charts, the ideal combinations for a market uptrend are 1) price gains in higher volume; and 2) declines in lower volume. Any drop of more than 0.2% in higher volume can be marked as a distribution day, or instance of heavy selling by institutional investors. If a large number of dozen distribution days (as few as four or five, or as many as 10 to 12) appear within a time span of five weeks or less, a market top or a near-term correction are highly possible.

If the market has been correcting and you're looking for a bottom, watch for either index to rally (in most cases, a minimum of 1.25% or more) in higher volume after it makes a low. Specifically, look for that price and volume burst (called a follow-through) to occur after the third day of the low.

Generally, each index should stay above its 50-day moving average, a dotted line that's plotted on both charts. A drop below it is not necessarily bad, but should get you to watch for more signs of trouble.

The Dow Jones industrials chart covers about six months. You can look for the same price and volume behavior as in the other indexes, but keep in mind that the Dow is easier to be skewed because it has only 30 stocks.

The IBD Mutual Fund Index tracks 19 funds that are managed by some of the most skilled stock pickers. If the funds' performances lag, that could be a sign that institutional investor-favored stocks are falling out of favor, or that stock picking is no better than indexing.

The put/call volume ratio (shown beneath the Nasdaq chart) can give valuable clues when it reaches extreme levels. Readings above 1.15 have coincided with market bottoms. Why? It points to an unusually high level of investor fear. High readings are noted with arrows on the graph. Extreme optimism or complacency, which can be interpreted as readings below 0.6, may indicate a market top is near.

The NYSE advance/decline line is a good indicator of market breadth. You want to see the line rising as a way of confirming market gains. A declining line while indexes are rising is a divergence that should be watched suspiciously.

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating for the indexes often lags a shift in the market's trend. One way to use them is to detect divergences, such as when the rating falls to D or E while indexes trade near highs.

The table of top 40 industry groups shows market leadership, so look for top stocks in those groups for investing ideas. Combined with the worst 40 table, investors can observe shifts in sector rotation. Watch for groups moving up from lower rankings over the past three and six weeks and, conversely, groups sliding in the rankings.

While savvy market observers will engross themselves in studying the market page, remember that [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) analyzes the information, detecting significant changes on the various indicators. The page, found this week on page B8 of the print edition, is also found online each day via a link at the bottom of this daily column.

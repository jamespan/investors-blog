  Which Industry Groups Could Get Trump Bump From Rule Delay?

Now that President Trump has ordered a delay of the Labor Department's controversial new fiduciary rule, which industry groups potentially stand to gain the most?


The rule, which is slated to take effect April 10, requires financial advisors and brokers to recommend investments in the best interests of clients instead of those merely suitable. That would force advisors and brokers to put clients' interest ahead of their own profit.


Financial firms have been deeply concerned about the potential effects of the new rule since it was approved last year. They fear it will hike advisory costs, making it less affordable for lower-income clients. That's why the delay has sharply boosted major banks and investment brokers.


As of Thursday, 10 financial-related industry groups made the top 20 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD. Life insurance, investment bankers and brokers, and money center banks have seen big recent gains.


The life insurance group includes highly rated stocks such as **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)), which bears a 98 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) but is extended from a 73.15 flat-base buy point. The Duluth, Ga.-based insurer is a [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) member. 


**Lincoln National** ([LNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNC)), with a 91 Composite, is near the top of its [buy range](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) from a 69.69 flat-base entry. New issue **Athene Holdings** ([ATH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATH)) (95) is extended from a 48.82 buy point of a flat base. Shares have rallied nearly 30% from a 40 offering price at the Dec. 9 debut.


The investment bank group includes asset managers such as **Raymond James Financial** ([RJF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RJF)), **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) and **Piper Jaffray** ([PJC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PJC)). Raymond James is trading near all-time highs as shares ride the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) higher. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based company shares the top Composite Rating, 99, in the 30-stock group.


The money center banks group, which includes **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)),Â  jumped 3% Feb. 3 on the news of the delay. The group remains near highs, following a 24% rally from its close on Nov. 8, election day, to its Jan. 13 peak.


All the above stocks (except Athene) have posted 28% or better gains since Trump was elected Nov. 8, amid views that he would loosen regulation in the financial market.

Morgan Stanley owns the top Composite, 98, in the group. Shares are far extended from a 32.47 cup-with-handle buy point first cleared in October. The stock triggered the 20% to 25% profit-taking rule in November and has been making new highs. 


Bank of America's 95 Composite is second best in the group. Shares of the Charlotte, N.C.-based banking giant have bounced off the 50-day line after consolidating sideways the past two months. They tripped the profit-taking rule in late November.


Goldman Sachs (also 95), which entered the profit-taking zone in mid-November, also has found support at its 50-day moving average. It's now extended from a bounce off the line near 232.


Proponents of Trump's delay action include the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade organization. "ICI supports a delay in implementation of the current DOL fiduciary rule," ICI President and CEO Paul Schott Stevens said in a statement. "The Administration should use this time to address flaws in the rule and pursue a harmonized standard across the retail and retirement marketplace, coordinating with the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure investors' best interests are paramount."


The Financial Planning Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, issued a statement saying it "strongly opposes" Trump's delay: "By issuing this memorandum, the President is directing the Department of Labor to produce an outcome that will likely lead to either a complete gutting of this thoroughly vetted consumer protection or lead to its outright demise. Either one is a bad outcome for American retirement savers."

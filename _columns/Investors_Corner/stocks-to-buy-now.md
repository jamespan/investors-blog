A breakout from a deep base is risky.

  

The deep base harbors more resistance — in the form of overhead supply — than a shallower pattern does. (Overhead supply is upside price resistance tied to prior purchases of the stock at higher prices by disgruntled investors hoping to break even.)

  

The deep base, though, is sometimes a necessary preface to a successful base.

  

For example, consider the first consolidation that forms after the lows of a severe bear market. The stock will rise off the bottom as a new bull market begins, then often retreat to form a shallower pattern within the larger consolidation.

  

How should an investor respond?

  

You don't want to try to buy off the bottom because it might not be the bottom.

  

Investors are better off buying the first or second base that forms after the bottom is established or, in more normal markets, the first or second base after a deep base fails. The new bases are often shallower and more likely to succeed.

  

Think about it in human terms. Traders who bought on the left side of the deep base probably are sitting on losses. As the right side builds, they either exit or lighten the position. If the stock breaks out, emotions may prod them to sell more.

  

The overwhelming emotions for these investors are regret and fear. They regret buying and fear that another decline is ahead.

  

In a way, they are right. Their selling naturally helps create a new decline.

  

The new decline, though, is less steep because there are fewer weak holders left.

  

New buyers harbor hope, not regret and fear. They are stronger holders, i.e., more willing to give the position time.

  

OK, but how deep is a deep base?

  

The textbook definition for a cup base is 20% to 30% deep (in normal markets). For a flat base or saucer base, a normal decline is shallower: No more than 15% for the flat base and 12% to 20% for the saucer.

  

An individual investor, though, shouldn't set concrete around the definition. Different stocks have different histories.

  

For instance, Latin American online retailer **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) has a history of fairly deep declines — followed by one or more run-ups from subsequent, more shallow bases. Some of the history:

  

From the May 2008 high, the stock corrected 86%. It began to rise off the bear-market bottom in late November 2008, along with the general market.

  

After rising sharply off its bottom, Mercado formed a 41% deep consolidation. In the context of the previous 86% drop, 41% was acceptable. The stock advanced about 70% from the 17.45 buy point.

  

The next two bases were 35% and 36% deep. They're slightly deeper than the textbook definition, but that's Mercado. Breakouts led to gains of 103% and 57%.

  

A 48% deep base completed in December 2011 failed. Success didn't come until a breakout in March 2013 from a 25% deep base. The gain was 42% to 61%, depending on whether or not the investor was willing to sit through pullbacks.

  

Mercado also formed a 46% deep base from October 2013 to October 2014 **(1)**. A breakout past a 119 handle gained 21%, but the stock began consolidating again. If it can hold above its 50-day line and finish its current pattern, a new breakout may occur.

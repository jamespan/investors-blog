  New Highs In Light Volume Can Mark End Of Stock's Run

Just like a runner can tire near the end of a long race, a stock can get tired after a lengthy run-up.


One way it shows fatigue is by etching new 52-week or all-time highs in unusually light volume.


Supply and demand govern a stock's price action. When the supply of readily available shares is low and demand is high, a stock's price goes up and vice versa. It's always preferable to see big volume behind a stock's move higher. It provides a sign that institutional investors are actively accumulating shares.


On the other hand, new highs in light volume indicate a lack of conviction behind the buying. This ultimately can point to the beginning of a period in which sellers overwhelm the buyers, sending prices spiraling down.


As we've seen in recent months, a stock can go up in light volume and continue higher, but there's plenty of market precedent that shows new highs in light volume can still yield a red flag, especially after the run has lasted for at least 18 weeks.


Another key warning sign is when the stock has created [multiple bases](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/653207-sell-into-late-stage-stock-market-rally.htm?Ntt=donald-gold-late-stage-breakout-investors-corner) and is failing to make new highs in heavy volume after its latest breakout. This is often a sign that buying demand is drying up.


**Peabody Energy** ([BTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BTU)) started a huge advance when it broke out of a base in December 2003. It rallied more than 600% through April 2006 before a series of new highs in light volume signaled a dry-up in buying demand. Four straight gains in below average trade **(1)** and a heavy-volume reversal **(2)** ultimately marked the end of the stock's run. Big institutional selling hit the stock soon after, and the stock lost about 50% over the next four months.


Questions come in occasionally asking if volume still matters in the market. They look at a stock like **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), which scored several new highs in light volume during the summer but kept right on going. Same with the Nasdaq composite. In July, it scored a series of new highs in below-average volume but continued higher as well.


Volume still matters. Decade after decade, the market shows that new highs in light volume after a long advance typically show a divergence in trend. Keep in mind, though, that new highs in light volume in the early stages of a stock's move doesn't necessarily mean its run is over. It can sometimes signal a short-term pullback, but if institutional support is strong, emerging leaders tend to recover quickly.

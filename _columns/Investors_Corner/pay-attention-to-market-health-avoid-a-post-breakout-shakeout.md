Life is full of second chances, and the stock market is no different.




There's always a sense of satisfaction when a breakout past a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) works. You watch a stock set up, knowing the pieces are in place for a successful breakout. Sure enough, the breakout works. In spades.


But it's not always that easy. Sometimes breakouts fail miserably. A stock clears a buy point, then falls 7%-8% below the buy point soon after. Following [a key IBD sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) designed to protect hard-earned capital, you [cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Sometimes, failed breakouts are explainable. Even if they're not, the first thing to keep in mind is that breakouts have the best chance of working in the early stages of a [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). That's the time when fresh institutional money is coming in from the sidelines.


Reasons Why Breakouts Can Fail
------------------------------


In some cases, breakouts have gotten more challenging. We're not in the early stages of a new bull market. The market bottomed in March 2009. Of course, some pullbacks have occurred along the way, but none that sharply exceeded a 20% correction that generally defines a bear market.


Buying a breakout late in a bull market lowers the odds of success. If you're buying breakouts and they're consistently not working, selling pressure is likely building in the broad market that may be a little difficult to recognize.


Stocks tend to struggle when the [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) starts to get elevated.


The distribution day count is found in the Market Pulse graphic in [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). Distribution days get counted when the market is in a confirmed uptrend or the uptrend is under pressure.


If you buy a breakout when the [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) is elevated, the odds aren't in your favor for a successful breakout.


Knowing a stock's trading personality before you buy is also paramount. How volatile is it? Does it tend to trade quietly, keeping its intraday price swings on a tight leash, or is it prone to daily price swings of 3% to 4% or even more?


O'Reilly's Stock Market Lesson
------------------------------


Volatile stocks can deliver huge gains, but it's easy to get shaken out of them, too.


**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY))'s breakout in the summer of 2011 was short-lived.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IC-082118-300x159.jpg)It cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 61.39 in June 2011, but rallied only 8% past the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) before turning tail. A weakening market was mostly to blame. At the time, IBD's market shifted from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure" as distribution days increased.


Traders had to cut losses as O'Reilly [fell 8% below the buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) about five weeks later.


O'Reilly bulls didn't have to wait long for a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The stock quickly found its footing. On Oct. 27, O'Reilly cleared a new buy point of 72.10 in a [three-month base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/). Volume surged 96% above its 50-day average. From there, it rallied 49% to a peak of 107.13 by May 2012.


**Alliance Data Systems** ([ADS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADS)) also suffered a shakeout after a breakout in heavy trade in late October 2011.


Alliance's rally faded in just two weeks. The breakout failed by Nov. 23 when it fell 8% below the 101.15 buy point.


The market suffered a sharp slide Nov. 1. The Nasdaq fell 2.9%. IBD showed a new market outlook of "Uptrend on pressure." But a new breakout in January 2012 yielded nice gains as the market calmed down and the rally picked up steam.

There was disappointment Monday over economic data in China. The National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday reported industrial growth of 6.1%, year-over-year, for August. That was a shade above July's 6% increase, but below the consensus forecast, which Bloomberg placed at 6.5%.

Another critical soft spot: Fixed-asset investment rose 10.9%, below views for an 11.2% gain.

The combined data strongly suggest China will have a hard time meeting its 7% GDP growth goal this year.

That sent the Shanghai composite down 4.4% before buyers (some argue government-backed buyers) stepped in and trimmed the loss to 2.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng converted a 2.5% dive to a 0.3% gain.

But beyond the industrial growth and investment numbers, Sunday's data also showed China's retail sales soared a better-than-expected 10.8% in August.

The numbers are difficult to parse. China is in transition to a domestic consumption-led economy.

Some analysts believe a portion of retail sales are shifting from bricks and mortar to online retailers, clouding the numbers.

But August's acceleration and last weeks' warning from **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) of slowing sales growth further complicates the view.

In addition, last week, the China Passenger Car Association reported auto sales reversed a two-month decline and rose 0.6% in August as dealers and automakers offered incentives and interest-free loans. Sedan sales fell 13%, SUV sales soared 55% and total passenger vehicle sales rose 6.3% in the first eight months of the year.

A side effect? Rising demand for gasoline. That also drove strong refinery activity in August. Refiners processed 44.3 million metric tons of crude oil in August, up 10.48 million barrels per day (1.8%) from July and a 6.5% increase over year-ago levels.

That led to an increasing oversupply of diesel gasoline, a byproduct of gasoline production. At the same time, slowing industrial growth and development mean less Chinese domestic demand for diesel.

Diesel demand fell to 3.47 million barrels a day in July, according to Bloomberg, while gasoline demand rose 17% year-over-year, to a near-record 2.73 million barrels.

The result points to rising diesel exports, which are likely to place additional downward pressure on global markets for the fuel.

This could be a boon for the diesel-hungry eurozone, which saw industrial activity rise 0.6% in August, its best showing since February.

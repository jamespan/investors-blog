Once you own a stock, the best way to profit is to sell it for more than you paid for it. Yes, you can collect dividends, but they're small in modern times, now roughly 2% a year for the S&P 500.


That small dividend can be wiped out in a single day. So the real way to make money in the stock market is to sell at a higher price than you bought. That's called capital appreciation.


New investors must be aware of several types of sell orders, which mirror the similar types of [buy orders](http://education.investors.com/Article/598080/201201181604/how-to-buy-stock-using-market-limit-buy-stop-orders.htm).


The first is the market order. It all but guarantees your sell order will be filled, but there's no guarantee of price. You would hope to get a price close to the last price, but if your stock is thinly traded (meaning it doesn't have much trading volume) you might not. Or if the market is moving quickly, perhaps because of a news event, you might get a price that is quite different from the price when you entered your sell order.


A sell limit order gives you a chance of getting the price you want, but with no guarantee it will be executed. Say your **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) shares are trading at 410, and you'd be happy to sell them for 420. You can put in a sell limit order at 420. If the stock hits 420, your order will be executed at the best price at 420 or higher.


The danger is that the stock may never reach 420 and instead head lower. In that case, you might wish you had used a market order and taken your profit at 410.


A third type of sell order is the sell stop order. This is used to protect an investor from a larger loss than he is willing to take.


Say you buy a stock at 40, but are unwilling to take a loss of more than 10%. You can place a sell stop order at 36. If the stock never drops that much, the order isn't executed. But the instant your stock hits 36, your order becomes a market order and is executed at the best available price.

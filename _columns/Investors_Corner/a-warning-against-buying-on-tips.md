  Why Buying On Stock Tips Stymies The Learning Curve

Some folks are constantly in search of stock tips. Others are just as anxious to serve up suggestions for their idea of a winning stock.


It seems like a perfect match. And it's true, some get lucky.


But most stock tips turn out to be duds.


There is nothing wrong with learning about stocks through casual conversations. But a tip, by definition, is just a small piece. Problems occur when a person invests without studying up and researching what she or he is buying.


The practice is not only risky, it short-changes an investor's learning curve. It sidesteps the process that teaches when to buy, when and how much to add to a position, when to take some profits and when to sell.


These hard-earned lessons do not typically come quickly or easily, even for the most diligent students. The stock market is the school of hard knocks â€” it doesn't let you cut class and cram in the final few hours.


The more time developing investors put into grasping the rudiments, the more muscle they build in pinpointing their own stock picks. The goal is to be an investor others are plying for tips.


If that seems challenging, well, it is. So is being a good tennis player, or earning an MBA. But keep in mind, the stock market is one of the most equal opportunity environments in the world.


Stocks will either grow or erase your wealth with no regard for age, sex, education, cultural background, religious affiliation or any other factor of private life. No one is special. The ones who survive and thrive, over time, are those who learn to cover their keisters by treating their investing efforts as a discipline, by learning to research fundamentals, read chart patterns and keep a steady eye on market behavior.


Where do you get started? Read "How to Make Money in Stocks," by William O'Neil, IBD founder and chairman. At the same time, start using Investor's Business Daily and the [research section](http://research.investors.com/) of Investors.com website to gauge the health of a stock.


Learn the minimum requirements for leadership-grade earnings and sales growth. Learn the value of paying for more expensive stocks, and why average daily volume size matters. Learn to use IBD's EPS, RS and Composite ratings to gauge a stock's strength, relative to its industry peers.


These are all critical basics that will build your investing prowess.


Read [New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm), [Internet & Technology](http://news.investors.com/technology.aspx) and Industry Snapshot articles to learn specifics about the company, its products, markets and competitors.


Use Investors.com's [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) to compare stocks within an industry, and to learn to gauge their support from institutional investors such as hedge funds and mutual funds. Read [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing/stock-spotlight.htm), Smart Tables Review and other of IBD's B-section coverage to understand a stock's chart action and learn how to spot bases and buy points.


And read the Big Picture, the best way to keep tabs on overall market behavior, which gives investors clear, day-to-day prescriptions for how to follow the lead of the smart money investors driving the market.


Again, you want to be the person others are asking for stock tips. And when they do, remember to reply by asking, "What is the first thing you do before buying a stock?"

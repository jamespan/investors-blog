[Hope, Fear And Greed](http://news.investors.com/SpecialReport/589548/201110271548/Hope-Fear-And-Greed-Psychological-Barriers-To-Winning-In-Stocks.aspx): **An Investor's Corner Series**

*First In A Series*

  

The stock market is human nature on parade.

  

It's an old saying that's worth repeating, especially as the Investor's Corner kicks off a series on psychology and investing.

  

Because the market involves millions of people, with all of their greediness, hopes and fears, it doesn't behave like a completely efficient machine.

  

As soon as you realize this fact, and then recognize your own biases, you're on the road to becoming a better investor.

  

IBD's upcoming series will explore a range of aspects. One column will look at the sentiment indicators. The bulls vs. bears graph, for example, can be used as a contrarian indicator. In other words, you should get worried when everyone else is bullish.

  

We'll also talk about another contrarian indicator: magazine covers. It can be a sign that sentiment around a company's stock is at its peak when the CEO graces a magazine cover.

  

Academics have even picked up on this trend. One recent study found that firms led by superstar CEOs, meaning execs who have just won awards or received high-profile positive press, subsequently end up underperforming in terms of stock price.

  

Other columns will touch on key biases such as overconfidence and anchoring.

  

With overconfidence, you might refuse to sell a stock even when it's dropped 8% from your purchase price (which should trigger the golden sell rule). You would hold on if you just can't admit that you've bought a loser.

  

This behavior also relates to the idea of anchoring. In this case, anchoring has to do with sticking to your initial assessment of a stock. You just can't be budged from your first point of view, even when presented with contrary evidence.

  

Another bias that will get some attention is holding a grudge against certain industries. You should let an industry's performance, including whether it has fundamentally strong firms leading it, dictate whether to invest in it or not.

  

What's more, keep in mind that you also can be unreasonably biased in favor of certain industries, leading you to ignore other more promising areas.

  

Everyone has biases, including Wall Street analysts. So another column in this series on investing psychology will look into why you should be careful about following tips. Taking tips is easy, but it can turn out to be costly.

  

Analysts' opinions and forecasts ought to be viewed as only that â€” opinions and forecasts. Even analysts and money managers often act like a herd and go with the flow. The price-and-volume action of a stock is the ultimate opinion that you should follow.

  

It can be tough for a lone analyst to break from a pack of analysts who believe they're covering the greatest thing since **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)). It's not easy to be the only guy or lady who's downgrading to "hold" or "sell," or cutting profit forecasts.

  

You also ought to think about whether the bank that employs this analyst has done business with the company being covered.

  

Did the bank underwrite the IPO or a secondary offering? In the past, studies have shown that such analysts are more optimistic than those who aren't associated with an equity issue.

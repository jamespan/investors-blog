Flat bases are relatively easy to find, especially if you use [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) pattern recognition tools.


With any good leading stock, a time eventually comes when it needs to consolidate gains.




Even a market leader in a strong market will frequently start trading sideways weeks or months after a strong breakout. The stock may seem to go nowhere for weeks. That can shake out some investors but it doesn't mean it's time to give up. A more patient investor will wait to see what happens next.


There can be more than one reason for this. The market may have turned weak. But the stock could also be moving sideways as it holds on to its recent gains. In both cases, if the stock continues to meander for five weeks or longer, it may end up forming a flat base.


The flat base has a simple structure: The difference between the high and low point in the base is not more than 15%. That can be a sign of strong institutional support.


 Finding Flat Base Is Easy
--------------------------


To spot flat bases, start counting the weeks from the first drawdown from a high. Sometimes, the base may be a little less than five weeks long. But on the daily chart, if the stock formed the base over 25 trading days, that should do. It still qualifies as a flat base.


A flat base can also be a tool to find out which stocks are likely to ride out a sharp market correction. When other stocks are hurtling lower, it feels good to see some that are lower by just 15% or less over the duration of the base. However, breakouts in such conditions have a higher chance of failing. It's best to wait for the market to improve before buying.


The high price point on the left side of the flat base is the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/). Remember, this can be an intraday high. If the stock is within 5% above the buy point, consider it still in [buying range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/).

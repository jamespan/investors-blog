  Chipotle Stock and Why You Should Target Leaders, Not Laggards During New Uptrends

It's sometimes awkward to be the first to arrive at a party, but in the stock market, there's nothing wrong with it all. It's called emerging leadership.




In the early stages of a market uptrend, stocks coming out of the gate first — breaking out of bases — tend to go on to reap the biggest gains. They're typically industry group leaders showing high relative price strength due to signs of powerful institutional buying — not laggards that are far off highs due to shaky fundamentals.


This is where investors often go astray when new money starts to come in from the sidelines after a market pullback. They focus on the laggards instead of the leaders.


The best opportunities will come from stocks breaking out of bases with the best quarterly and annual earnings and growth, highest return on equity, biggest profit margin and strongest price action. A new product or service that's driving growth never hurts.

After a general market decline runs its course, focus on stocks that held up well during the decline. If major averages pull back 10%, for example, focus on growth names that corrected only 15% to 25% — not those that pulled back 35% to 45%, or possibly more.



Don't worry if you miss a few early breakouts. If it's a strong rally, there will be plenty more. Still, it's best to identify the big leaders during the first few weeks of a new market uptrend.


Chipotle Stock In 2010: How It Outpaced The Market
--------------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend on Sept. 1, 2010, rising 3% on the fourth day of a new rally attempt. The sign of strength came after an 18.7% pullback in the tech index earlier in the year. The Nasdaq rallied 33% over the next eight months, bringing several growth stocks along with it.


[Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) cleared a second-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on the same day the Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend. At the time, it ranked No. 17 in the IBD 100 (now [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)) with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99.![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/wICcmg080719-300x161.jpg)


Shares surged 6% in more than double average volume, clearing a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 154.53. It rallied 70% to a high of 262.77 in late November before forming a series of bases around its 10-week moving average **(1)**.

Chipotle's base showed a modest correction of 18% — not bad considering that growth stocks tend to fall 1.5 to 2.5 times the major averages during a market decline.

If you're an optimist, you're convinced that time is on your side.


Although pessimists say their negative view is "more realistic," the stock market and its history beg to differ.


Unroll a wall chart of the major stock indexes' multi-decade history and ask yourself this question: Does it slant up or down?


The bias is clearly up. Yet, the jagged moves within the trend can make life tough on investors.


"Our studies of all the best stocks of the last 50 years show that the period of greatest market performance lasts on average only about a year and a half to two years. Some last up to three years. Only a tiny number last for five or 10 years," William O'Neil wrote in "The Successful Investor."


Casual readers sometimes get the impression that IBD is about short-term trading.


IBD would much rather see an investor hitch a ride on a big winner and sit tight. With a big enough profit cushion, you can sit through a base-building correction.


Ideally, the goal is to buy the very best stocks at the very best time and hold them for the 18 to 24 months or more that they perform. Yet, that preference is dependent on the market. Not all uptrends provide the very best time.


The current market, for instance, is far from great.


That's why there are sell rules.


That's why investors are urged to take profits at 20% to 25% in many cases, while cutting losses at 7% or 8%. And in difficult markets, investors are urged to take profits at 10% to 15% and cut losses at 3% or 5%.


Occasionally, we'll get an e-mail from a pessimist who insists that we are fools who don't understand that we will never see a truly great market again.


The wall chart will answer that one, too. People believed the same thing when the rollicking 1920s turned into the glum 1930s, or when the lively 1960s turned into the sluggish 1970s.


No one knows when the next great bull market will begin.


This much we know: The leaders will have big earnings and sales, revolutionary new products or services or industry conditions, and a market worthy of confidence.


And the optimists will make money when that day comes. As for the pessimists, they'll sit on the sidelines until a bear market proves them "right."

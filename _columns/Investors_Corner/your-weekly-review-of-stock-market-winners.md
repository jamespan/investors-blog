IBD offers many screens and stock lists to help investors find the next round of stock market winners.


One screen to always check out is Your Weekly Review. It has many features not found anywhere else.


Published on Friday, Your Weekly Review is a computer-generated list of top-rated stocks. Investors can use it to spot trends, gauge the market's health, and, of course, find potential trade candidates.


Your Weekly Review can offer a broader picture on what's happening with leading stocks. In strong market uptrends, the list can show up to 120 charts and even more individual stocks on the tables. During market downtrends, significantly fewer stocks will appear.


Unlike the IBD 50 or Big Cap 20, the screening criteria for Your Weekly Review are clearly listed. The Your Weekly Review screen has a few less-stringent technical criteria. For one, the volume requirement calls for stocks with an average daily trading volume of 10,000 shares or more. So expect to find a lot of thin stocks at times.


Stocks usually move in groups due to some kind of technological shift, regulatory change or change in the state of the economy. You can see what industries are leading the pack, as Your Weekly Review is sorted by industry groups' relative strength.


While it's good to find a stock with top-notch earnings and sales growth, chances are that it might not go anywhere if it doesn't have institutional sponsorship behind it. It's professional buying that can significantly move a stock.


In Your Weekly Review, there's a table that highlights a high-performing mutual fund that has a big investment in a stock. You'll find the 36-month performance rating for the fund, as well as the percentage of the fund's assets in the stock.


You'll also easily see whether the fund established a new position, bought more shares or reduced their position.


The March 22 edition of Your Weekly Review noted that T. Rowe Price Media & Telecommunications Fund established a new position in professional networking website **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)).


The stock has been a big winner since breaking out from a cup with handle in January. Also, LinkedIn made up 3.2% of the T. Rowe Price Media fund. The stock has recently pulled back to its 10-week line.

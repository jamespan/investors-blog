Whether a great stock has booked a gain of 50% or 500%, it's normal to think the stock could possibly run much higher.

  

Yet once you find a stock that goes beyond a third-stage base, the ever-present questions are: When should I get out? When should I lock in the gain? How can I avoid a possible meltdown in the position?

  

3D printer-maker **Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) offered some pointed lessons recently. The stock cleared a third-stage base with a 69.18 entry late in November 2012. Even before the base, shares had run up 296% from a September 2011 low. After the third-stage breakout, they climbed another 33%, then started a new consolidation.

  

This pullback was 35%, barely within allowable limits. The stock cut its 10-week line in mild trade, not sending any panic signals. But most of this fourth-stage base formed below its 10-week moving average **1**. It also shaped a low handle. Both signal potential weakness.

  

The stock still broke out past 81.55 in the week ended May 3. It rose for two weeks, then dropped 9% below the proper buy point **2** . This was a signal to offload at least any shares added during that breakout.

  

Long-term holders rode through a fresh seven-week cup. The base count stayed the same since Stratasys hadn't rallied 20% past the 81.55 prior entry. Stratasys barely pushed above the late-stage base's 95 buy point in so-so trade on July 11 and 15. It then pulled back 10% below the buy point. It dropped through its 10-week line and 13% below the 95 buy point on Aug. 7 **3**. New buyers had to cut losses.

  

The next day, the stock retook the buy point in huge trade. Stratasys rose 19% past 95 through the end of August. Shares quickly turned down into a 21% correction **4**. This eight-week cup with handle sat on top of the prior cup.

  

Stratasys crawled above the 113.04 buy point in weak trade on the last day of October. But the stock wasn't done yet. It shaped a final sloppy six-week cup **5**. The breakout in weak trade Dec. 31 peaked two sessions later, then began coming undone.

  

It is hard to say whether there was a "perfect" point to exit the stock. Investors who bailed out at the first late-stage tremors would have missed out on significant late-throes gains. However, keep in mind that once a market leader tops, research shows the average decline is 72% off the peak. Today, Stratasys has returned to the 95 breakout point.

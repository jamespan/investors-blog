Technology moves quickly. IBD helps you not just get a handle on the latest and greatest, but it also helps you find stocks that are at the forefront of the latest advancements or benefiting from new technology.

The Internet & Technology section, found every day in the newspaper's A section, offers a wealth of investment ideas and the latest news from tech leaders in fields from semiconductors to e-commerce, enterprise software and biotechnology.

For even more coverage, including breaking news and intraday updates, check out the technology landing page on Investors.com by hovering over the News tab and clicking on the [Technology](http://news.investors.com/technology.aspx?nav=NewsTechnology) link in the right column.

A look at the Internet & Technology page shows one or more feature articles daily. The DataBus feature at the top of the page (today on A5) highlights industry trends. The July 28 issue, for example, features revenue forecasts for the cybersecurity market. Industry revenue topped \$72 billion in 2014 and is expected to grow at an 8% compounded rate for the next five years, according to Gartner and UBS.

The DataBus graphic of July 28 also shows sales growth estimates for some key companies in the emerging field. **FireEye** ([FEYE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEYE)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) show the biggest estimates. A quick [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup) shows that while FireEye has been losing money, Palo Alto Networks is posting big profit growth.

The superior performance has shown up in the stock's chart. Palo Alto has climbed as much as 176% from a double-bottom base breakout a little more than a year ago. The stock offered additional buy points from flat-base breakouts in August 2014 and again in February 2015, as well as numerous areas of support at its 10-week moving average.

It was not the first time that Palo Alto Networks could be spotted on the Internet & Technology page or other features at IBD.

On May 29, 2014, as Palo Alto broke out past a 72.60 double-bottom buy point, IBD [posted](http://news.investors.com/technology/052914-702568-palo-alto-networks-earnings-beat-boosts-stock.htm) a tech story online highlighting strong quarterly earnings results, the settlement of a key lawsuit and a wave of analyst upgrades. Several more updates were posted to the Technology page on Investors.com throughout June.

On Oct. 10 1, the Internet & Technology page featured an [interview](http://news.investors.com/technology-tech-exec-qanda/100914-721058-interview-with-palo-also-networks-ceo-mark-mclaughlin.htm) with CEO Mark McLaughlin highlighting his background and what differentiates Palo Alto from competitors.

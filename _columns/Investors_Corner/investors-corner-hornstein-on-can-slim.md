IBD's CAN SLIM strategy aims to make investing easier, but the approach is multifaceted and takes time to master.

  

Still, people are successful with it every day. And some of them have inspiring stories that might help other IBD readers.

  

With that in mind, this Investor's Corner column features a Q&A with Edward S. Hornstein.

  

In 2002, he was a newly minted lawyer looking to put some of his paycheck into stocks. But he was also leery of the market — which he then viewed as "nothing more than a casino," he says.

  

He came across "How to Make Money in Stocks," the best-seller by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil. Over the next few years, Hornstein read all of O'Neil's books, studied IBD, pored over stock charts and attended IBD seminars.

  

By late 2007, he had grown so passionate about investing that he quit his job as an attorney to run his own money management firm, Hornstein Capital Management.

  

While 2008 ended up being an ugly year for stocks, Hornstein says CAN SLIM helped him keep his clients "protected and out of the way."

  

The 33-year-old New Yorker says his life is much better thanks to O'Neil and CAN SLIM. (Go to the Education section of Investors.com to read specific articles on each aspect of CAN SLIM.)

  

**IBD:** You've put in years of effort to become a better investor. What is the most important thing that you have learned?

  

**Hornstein:** It's persistence. The CAN SLIM system and investing in the market (are) challenging. I think that's why some people don't do as well as maybe they could do, because they don't have the persistence. If they have a bad streak, people tend to navigate away from the system and try something else.

  

The most important thing for me is believing in the system and understanding that — as Bill has said — it's not just some random system. It's a study of the historical context of how the market — both the indices and leading stocks — actually work.

  

It's understanding that, no matter how good you get, you're going to have streaks where you lose money sometimes. You're going to have other times where you make money. (It's) understanding that if you do stick to the rules, in the end — over the long term — you're probably going to do very well.

  

**IBD:** In your first few years of investing, what was especially challenging?

  

**Hornstein:** The first thing was (appreciating) the big stock principle. The greatness of Bill's system is the understanding that every cycle, you're going to have these new and innovative companies that have outstanding earnings and sales growth, superior margins, products that change the way we work and live. The chart patterns will confirm that the institutions are buying them and will give you a buy point.

  

Early on, I concentrated a bit too much just on the technicals. Any time a stock was breaking out I'd want to buy it, instead of stepping back and saying, "OK, what are the five or 10 big stocks that the institutions are really going to want to own?" Now, if I see some stocks breaking out that don't have the big fundamentals and the stories, I'll just let them go.

  

**IBD:** What stands out about the first big stock that you handled correctly — Google in 2005-06?

  

**Hornstein:** It was really the first time that I put the pieces together and saw a big, institutional-quality stock gap out of a base, and I wasn't afraid to buy it. A lot of times with these gaps ... it's scary to go chase that stock. But from studying the big winners of the past, I understood that those are some of your highest-probability trades.

  

Once I bought **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)), it kind of took care of itself, where I was able to just sit back and almost every day the stock kept running up. That kind of reinforced for me that following the rules, following the system, being patient and waiting to get those opportunities where you have big stocks that have those breakaway gaps can really make your year.

  

**IBD:** You managed to increase the value of your portfolio fourfold from March 2003 to early 2004, but then gave all of your gains back. You found that you weren't following CAN SLIM's sell rules and kept studying. Why didn't you just give up then?

  

**Hornstein:** I think you have to like it. If somebody wants to invest and they want to use CAN SLIM, but their heart and their mind aren't really in it, then they're going to be at a disadvantage.

  

When I started learning about the market, learning the system and going through chart books, it wasn't something that was a means to an end. It wasn't just, "Oh, I want to do this because I want to make a lot of money." I actually enjoyed the process of doing it. For me, when I had made a lot of money and then had given it all back, it was kind of like a big puzzle. Although it certainly wasn't fun going through that, I looked at it as a challenge and enjoyed going back and saying, "OK, let me figure this out."

  

**IBD:** Why did you decide to start your own money management firm and leave law?

  

**Hornstein:** I just found that when I was practicing law, my heart wasn't in it. I would rush to get home and spend all night looking at charts and thinking about the market and the system. I just wanted to really dive into it, and it's how I wanted to spend my life.

  

I was always a big believer that if you can find something that you're really passionate about, you have all the more chance of excelling. I don't really consider it work, so I just decided that it was worth taking a shot and making it a full-time endeavor.

  

**IBD:** How has all of this affected your life outside the workday?

  

**Hornstein:** I still work very hard, and I work a lot of hours at this, but my schedule is a lot more flexible now. It frees up time to spend with my wife and my (2-year-old) son. When I was a lawyer, because of the constant client demands, I couldn't really make my own schedule. I was on somebody else's schedule.

  

**IBD:** Some of your other successful investments have been Research In Motion, Apple and Baidu. Could you go over one of those trades?

  

**Hornstein:** **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) formed a double bottom and broke out early in September of 2007. It came right out on volume, and I bought the stock. It ran up very, very quickly on just enormous volume. From there, I just kind of put it aside. You know, it had the earnings and the sales growth, it was acting just right and the market had a follow-through day. So I put it on the side and said, "This has the potential to be a big winner. I don't want to get shaken out."

  

**IBD:** It triggered the 8-week hold rule?

  

**Hornstein:** Exactly. Bill has talked about if a stock goes up 20% in three weeks or less, you want to try to hold it for eight to 12 weeks with the idea that it could be one of the true market leaders. I had thought that with Baidu.

  

There were times when the stock had gone up for five, six, seven days in a row, and I'd look at it on a chart, and I'd just say to myself, "This thing needs to pull back." It would be very tempting to sell some. But I just had to remind myself of following the rules, and that the whole point of doing this system is that when you get those leaders, you really want to hold onto them until they break down. Because they can go up further than you ever could have imagined. I bought the stock in the low 200s, and it ended up being a double in about six weeks.

  

I sold it just shy of 400, and then the stock went up another 30 or 35 points even after I sold it. But you know, you're never going to sell at the top. Then the market topped at the end of October, and we had the bear market.

  

The important lesson was that the stock was showing such enormous power coming out of that base, that at that point I'd become mature enough to put the stock on the side. Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to do nothing. But when you think you could be in one of the true market leaders, and the market's acting just right, you might be better off giving it every chance in the world. All it really takes is one or two leaders per cycle played properly and it really could change your financial well-being.

  

**IBD:** So for Baidu you sold into strength as opposed to seeing an obvious sell sign?

  

**Hornstein:** Yeah. The market at that point had about five or six distribution days — there was definitely distribution in the general market. And a bunch of stocks looked like they were doing kind of little mini-climaxes. (That) told me ... it was probably time to move out of the way.

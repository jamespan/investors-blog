When a breakout stalls, it doesn't feel good. But feelings can be a poor guide in the stock market. What factors should you consider when trying to sit through a breakout that wobbles? Some stocks edge slowly higher, either in heavy or light turnover, without making much progress. In most cases you want to give the stock room to develop. It may be the first to cut loose, though, if the market weakens or you need to raise cash for a more enticing opportunity.

A stock can also stall by finishing low in the daily range on the day of the breakout. You prefer to see a breakout close above the entry, though a close below is not necessarily reason to sell the stock.

When a stock spends time hovering near the buy point, it gives you a chance to take a second look at the key CAN SLIM factors.

Is this truly the leader in its industry? Are the earnings and sales growth huge? What about the base? Was it proper and showing accumulation?

If your selection criteria hold up under scrutiny, in most cases you want to give the stock the benefit of the doubt. If a second review finds too many flaws, though, it's best to just get out and look for a true leader. And if a stock falls 7% to 8% below the price you paid, sell immediately.

Also, check the general market. Is it lifting most boats higher or acting like a lid on breakouts as distribution days pile up? Most breakouts will fail when the market is under heavy distribution.

Buying exactly right is crucial to keep you in tune with the stock's movements. If you buy extended, then minor stalling can feel severe because you will be underwater on the position. Remember, roughly four out of 10 big winners will pull back to a proper buy point or just below. So, buying correctly is key to weathering the storm.

In an aggressive bull market you may be quicker to cut and run on a slow mover because many other stocks are breaking out and moving higher.

When you sit with a stock that stalls or reverses, you want to see it recover fairly quickly. If it's truly a leader and under accumulation, it should bounce back to new highs without too much drifting.

Addressing the issue of when to sell, IBD founder and chair William O'Neil wrote, "Your objective is to buy the best stock with the best earnings at exactly the right time and to have the patience to hold it until proven right or wrong."

Biotech leader **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) offers some perspective on holding a stock through a hesitant breakout.

In mid-February 1990 it broke out past a 55.60 double-bottom buy point. Volume was below average **(1)** and the stock stalled, closing low in the range and just below the buy point. Not what you want to see, but the stock did not do anything to warrant selling. It had leading stock characteristics with a 94 EPS and 89 RS Rating on the day of the breakout.

Shares over the next week waffled above and below the buy point, falling as much as 2.4% below the entry **(2)**. Three weeks into the move, it tested the buy point for a final time. Big volume finally came into the stock **(3)**, and Amgen charged 80% higher before building a second base. It climbed more than 700% in less than two years.

The double-bottom base is one of the basic chart patterns among huge stock market winners in the [CAN SLIM catalog](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), alongside the venerable cup with handle.

If a good double bottom is identified during a bull market, a strong breakout in big volume by the stock can lead to handsome gains in a stock.

The double bottom is shaped like the letter W. An important distinction is that the second leg down should undercut the first.

IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil, who developed the chart-reading strategy over the past six decades, says the undercut of the second leg — even by just a penny — is a necessary shakeout, as a final purge of weak holders, before the stock can advance. In that respect, it serves a similar use to the handle in a cup-with-handle base.

A second leg that doesn't undercut the first down leg is failure prone, O'Neil says. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the middle peak.

Many of the requirements for a double bottom are similar to those for a cup with handle. There should be a prior uptrend. The base should be a minimum of seven weeks. The correction should be moderate, usually 20% to 30% from high to low. Or a bit more if the market has had a severe correction.

Double bottoms can have handles, but they aren't necessary for a sound base. Many stocks form double bottoms and shoot straight past the buy point into profitable territory. It's ideal to see the stock's volume pick up at least 40% to 50% above its 50-day average at the breakout.

**Nokia** ([NOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOK)) formed a classic double bottom in late 1998. The general market began a severe and painful bear market in July of that year. But an Oct. 15 follow-through day kicked off one of history's great bull markets, led by tech stocks.

Cellphones were just gaining in popularity, and Finland-based Nokia and Sweden-based Ericsson practically owned the space. Both made huge advances during the bull market.

Nokia completed its first leg down during the week ended Sept. 4, 1998 **(1)**. Notice that the stock finished higher and in the upper half of its weekly range. That's bullish. The second leg undercut the first on the week ended Oct. 9 **(2)**.

Nokia fell for the week, but again it finished in the upper half of its daily range. The careful chart reader could have spotted a pattern developing and put it on a watch list before it broke out.

Nokia broke out during the week ended Oct. 23, rising 7.7% that week and sprinting past an 85.10 entry point (the chart above shows the entry adjusted for later stock splits). That big move helped make it one of the first big winners to emerge in the new bull market.

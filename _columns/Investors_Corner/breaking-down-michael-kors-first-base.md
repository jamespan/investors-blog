  Michael Kors' First Base Was Brief But Effective

IPO bases — the very first bullish pattern a stock creates in its trading history — can be shorter than normal. **Michael Kors**' ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) version certainly fit that description.


After its initial public offering (IPO), a stock's initial weeks in the market can be wild and unsettled. But at some point, the trading will settle down and a base can quickly form. A new IPO stock can also shoot up with unusual energy and give early shareholders a prodigious gain.


But investors still need to study a stock chart to find the proper buy point, which can be harder to spot on a brand new chart than on a long-established one.


The upscale accessories maker and retailer went public on the NYSE on Dec. 15, 2011. For Kors, the IPO base formed swiftly.


From the first day, the stock traded above the offering price of 20 a share. A 12% surge the second week showed Kors was winning over institutional investors.


In the fourth week of trading, Kors had its first decline **(1)** . A drop of less than 5% wasn't much to fuss about. It was hard to gauge volume with such a new stock, but the down week's trading, while higher than the prior week, wasn't excessive. That gave chart readers some reassurance.


Two weeks later, in the week ended Jan. 20, 2012, Kors surged to a new high in heavy trading **(2)**.


That was the breakout for this IPO base. From a 27.68 buy point to the peak of 50.69 two months later, the stock vaulted 83%.


To be sure, this IPO base was easy to miss. It is perhaps somewhat of a misnomer for an Investor's Corner series that goes under the banner of classic IPO bases. Even on IBD Leaderboard, the base was said to be too short to be a true IPO pattern.


A two-week consolidation indeed can be too short for most stocks. But Kors had something relatively few stocks can boast — a potent set of fundamentals.


Earnings per share had bulged 117% and 213% the two quarters leading up to the IPO. Sales growth was 60% and 61%, in line with previous quarters.


As the market would learn after its fourth-quarter results, the company's fiscal 2011 and 2012 profit climbed 81% and 129%, respectively. Sales increased 58% and 62%. Pretax margin of 21.4% in fiscal 2012 was the highest ever; return on equity was a very robust 57.4%.


With those numbers, Kors established itself not just as a leader in its category but also in the broad market.


When a true leader like that forms a base that may seem too narrow in scope, don't ignore it. Study it carefully, especially if the market is in a confirmed uptrend.


The stock formed its first conventional base from March to August of 2012. The breakout didn't produce much of a gain, as did a couple of subsequent bases. But Michael Kors started another strong advance in July 2013.

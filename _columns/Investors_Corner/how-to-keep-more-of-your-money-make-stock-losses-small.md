Let's say there's a hot social media stock that's been a market leader. We'll call it Facesnapinstatwit.com.

Shares have been falling for a couple of weeks and are 8% below the 34.50 you paid for it just a week earlier. That's a considerable loss, but not a disaster. Should you sell?

Nobody like to take a loss, and who knows if Facesnapinstatwit.com shares will bounce right back? But if the stock keeps falling, the loss could become much worse and harder to recover.

It's a common conundrum of investing, but there's an easy way to deal with it: Sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price. Don't think it over, or wring your hands over it.

That may sound like mindless portfolio management, but it actually makes a lot of sense.

For one, cutting losses short preserves your portfolio. Just a few sharp losses of, say, 15% can leave you considerably poorer. It may take years for a stock to recover from a major loss, and some never do.

By limiting losses, you can stay ahead of the game as you take profits of 20% to 25% on successful trades. Typically, leading stocks will climb 20% or 25% from their buy points before they start their next price corrections. If you buy at the right time and take profits at those levels, you'll maintain a ratio of 3-to-1 in wins to losses.

Why cut losses at 8%? Why not 10%? Research shows that winning stocks tend to fall no more than 8% from their proper buy points. This historical trend is as much a reason for the 7%-8% sell rule as any other.

But treat that as a cost of investing. IBD founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil has characterized it as the premium on "coverage" against a much larger decline.

Some investors use put options to protect against a downturn. But that can be more costly. A single contract can cost a few hundred dollars, and it affords protection only for the time until the put option expires.

Examples of the sell rule can be found just about any week. To illustrate it, let's take a look back at a true social media stock, **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)).Â From October 2014 to March 2015, the stock formed a cup-with-handle base. It broke out past a 50.11 buy point on March 24 **(1)**. Shares climbed no more than 7% then stalled out.

On April 28, after a frightful earnings report, Twitter shares plunged **(2)**. The loss on that single day left the stock more than 8% below the entry. It was time to sell. The stock stabilized for a few months but continued an abysmal performance from which it has yet to recover.

You get the idea. Now drop and give me 22.

  

**1.** Don't swing for the fences; get in the habit of taking profits at 20% to 25%. Study the exceptions, like a stock gaining 20% or more in three weeks.

  

**2.** Take profits if a stock stages a number of big-volume, downside reversals. The message: Institutions are packing their bags.

  

**3.** Bag your gains when a leader posts its largest one-day point loss. This may not mark the end of an uptrend, but it's best to adopt a defensive stance.

  

**4.** Two weeks down/two weeks up. A sharp pullback and fast recovery to new highs suggests some fund managers have arrived late and are buying recklessly.

  

**5.** Red flag: a stock that stabs through its 50-day line in heavy volume. Institutional investors have become unable or unwilling to support the run's trend.

  

**6.** A leader reaching for new highs in light volume gives an early hint at possible topping action.

  

**7.** When market leaders start to break down, look for the exit.

  

**8.** Study and know your climax top signals. The downsides are often steep.

  

**9.** Be wary of too many stock splits and other signs of excessive optimism. They often shows a stock that has outrun the smart money.

  

**10.** A low accumulation grade — a D or an E — equals flagging institutional support.

  

**11.** Use the P-E expansion rule and earnings forecasts to set a price target. This gives an idea of a stock's potential end game.

  

**12.**A break below a trend line, drawn across a stock's lows over several months, raises a red flag.

  

**13.**A jump above the upper channel line looks good and feels great, but it's a warning.

  

**14.**Beware of a buildup of market distribution days. Take your gains when the institutions do.

  

**15.** Mind the Relative Strength line and rating. An RS Rating dropping below 70 is a late signal.

  

**16.** Sell if the stock dives below its 200-day moving average. This too works best as a late signal.

  

**17.** Have your finger on the eject button if your stock forms a late- stage base.

  

**18.** A sharp drop in earnings growth signals troubling change in the company or its markets.

  

**19.** Beware of rebounds in light trade after heavy-volume sell-offs. The big money is shoving off.

  

**20.** A big down day in the biggest spike in volume, daily or weekly, signals institutional selling pressure.

  

**21.** Some stocks can be sold when trading 70% to 100% above the 200-day moving average.

  

**22.** A shift to highly volatile action after smooth gains spells trouble.

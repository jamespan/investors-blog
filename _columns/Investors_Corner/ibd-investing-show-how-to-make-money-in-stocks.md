Understanding investing theory is important. But learning how to actually apply that theory in the real world — in today's market — is absolutely critical.

  

That's where the IBD investing show comes in.

  

In each weekly episode of ["How to Make Money in Stocks with Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/investingshow)," IBD national speakers and market commentators help you make sense of current market conditions and see which rules you can use to decide whether to buy, sell or hold.

  

So if you haven't tuned in yet, here are three reasons to make watching the show part of your regular weekly routine.

  

**Put The Market In Perspective**

  

Without a framework for separating the facts from the noise, distinguishing between normal, daily market fluctuations and a true change in trend can be hard.

  

That's how investors become overly excited or too discouraged.

  

To help prevent excessive emotion, we step back to see how the recent action in the indexes and leading stocks fits into the longer-term trend — and note if any signs indicate that the trend may be changing.

  

We also discuss which signals to look for to see if it's time to buy stocks or start moving safely to the sidelines.

  

**Find Timely Stock Ideas**

  

Another purpose of the show is to help you identify stocks that are forming bases and could be getting ready to break out.

  

You'll also see how to evaluate such stocks to see if they fit your investing strategy and goals.

  

**Get Tips On How To Invest**

  

Buy and sell rules are effective only if you know how to apply them and have the discipline to follow them in the heat of battle.

  

We try to bring the rules to life by showing how they come into play in current and historical examples using leading stocks like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).

  

You'll find these lessons in rotating segments like "Teachable Market Moments," "Super Stocks," "Tips on Tools" and "Would You Buy (Sell) This Stock?"

  

Recent examples include a look at [Netflix's double-bottom breakout](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/netflix-double-bottom-breakout-ibd-investing-show-excerpt/), how the 50- and 200-day moving averages serve as a stock's [first and second lines of defense](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/ibd-investing-show-excerpt-a-stocks-first-and-second-line-of-defense/) and [three key concepts](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/ibd-investing-show-excerpt-3-keys-to-understanding-chart-patterns/) for understanding chart patterns and buy points.

  

We also just did a five-part series on [how to spot chart patterns](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/ibd-investing-show-excerpt-the-3-most-profitable-chart-patterns/), as well as an episode that featured a [four-step investing routine](http://ibdtv.investors.com/video/how-to-find-winning-stocks-ibd-investing-show-excerpt/) that you can use to gauge market health and build your watch list.

  

Bottom line: The goals of the IBD investing show are to continually improve your investing skills and to help you stay in sync with the market trends that affect your money.

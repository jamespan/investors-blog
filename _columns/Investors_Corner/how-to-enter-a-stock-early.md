An early entry in a stock can be advantageous in some cases.

For example, if an area of price resistance emerges within a flat base and the stock clears that price in strong volume, then the disciplined investor is wise to act.

Isn't that cheating on the IBD system? And isn't that likely to increase the odds of a failed trade?

The answer to those two questions depends on the context.

If an investor identifies an area of resistance within a base and buys the stock as it crosses the area in lackluster volume, then the buy is little more than a blind gamble.

In such circumstances, the buy has little to do with the IBD approach to investing. Without volume, there is no reason to believe that funds are behind the move.

Usually the stock that crosses a resistance area in unmistakably strong volume has other things going for it as well.

For example, sometimes a stock will clear resistance in big volume on an earnings report. When big volume confirms the entry's validity, there's little reason to wait.

**Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) began forming a long, flat base in the fall of 2011. In July 2012, Marissa Mayer took over as Yahoo's CEO while the stock continued to consolidate.

A new factor can energize a company. Mayer was an engineer by education and had experience as Google's vice president of location and search.

She followed several disappointing Yahoo CEOs, including the one before her who was accused of lying on his resume. It led to his exit and the departure of the search-committee director.

By late October, the flat base's traditional entry would have been the high of 16.75 plus 10 cents, or 16.85 **(1)**. However, the stock developed a handle-like resistance level at 16.38. Adding 10 cents, the new entry became 16.48 **(2)**, 2.2% below the standard 16.85 entry.

After hours on Oct. 22, 2012, Yahoo reported an 86% pop in earnings on a 1% drop in revenue â€” topping the Street's estimates on both. The next day, the stock surged 6%, clearing the early entry at 16.48 and finishing the session at 16.67 in volume 258% above normal.

The traditional breakout in strong volume occurred six sessions later on Nov. 2.

The early entry's gain to a mid-May 2013 high of 27.68 was 68% in about seven months. For the traditional entry, the stock was nearly 4% above the 16.85 entry by the time volume kicked in.

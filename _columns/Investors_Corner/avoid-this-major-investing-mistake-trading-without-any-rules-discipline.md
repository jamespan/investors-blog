If you want to avoid major investing mistakes in the world of Wall Street, know this: The stock market is no place for the undisciplined. In a good market, investors who operate without trading rules can expect nothing more than serendipitous profits.

Novice investors who want to succeed consistently will find that investing discipline runs the gamut from screening for good stocks, to evaluating them, to ultimately buying and selling them at the proper time and price.

So, here's a beginner's guide to getting the right discipline throughout the process.

## Vital Screens

First, focus your efforts on screens of the best stocks, principally the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/).

Sector Leaders show stocks with superior fundamentals. In 2017, the price-weighted performance was stunning as the screen produced a 47.7% return. The number of stocks in Sector Leaders will change based on the health of top growth plays as well as the general market action.

Use the other screens to scan for companies with above-average sales, profits and margins. A weekly feature, [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/), offers detailed analysis on several high-quality stocks, the positive and negative aspects of their chart patterns, and the exact buy points.

## How To Do Stock Research And Avoid Future Investing Mistakes

Second, be disciplined about your research.

Any company you study should have at least a 25% increase in earnings and sales in the most recent quarter or two. Long-term growth should be strong, as well. Find those details on the mini charts and the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables, both in the IBD Weekly print edition and in the [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) section within "Stock Lists" at Investors.com.

It is crucial to study the stock's daily and weekly charts, which can tell you if a stock's demand is strong or weak.

## When To Buy Stocks

Third, be disciplined about buying.

You must know in advance the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) for any stock on your watch list.

Confused about that? Then use the brief chart analysis in the IBD mini charts, seen all throughout the second section of IBD Weekly. If there is a clear buy point for a stock, IBD market writers point it out for you in that short description.

Buy your shares only when a stock rises above that level, preferably in heavy volume. And don't chase the stock more than 5% past the correct buy point.

## The Endgame

Fourth, keep strict rules about selling every stock.Â Sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price. This is known as the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Also, sell any stock once you have a [profit of 20% to 25%](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).

A lot more goes into selling, but these two bread-and-butter rules will keep you on the right track.

Fifth, be disciplined about staying with the market trend.

Even if you pick solid firms, a weak market will drag your results. Buy stocks only when the IBD Market Pulse (found every day inside [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/)) says the market is in a confirmed uptrend. When the market comes under pressure, you must be much more careful about buying, and don't buy at all when indexes are in a correction.

Keep in mind that being disciplined doesn't mean you must be inflexible. You'll come across stocks that satisfy most of your rules, but miss on one or two areas. Don't automatically dismiss those. You can buy them at the proper entry and sell them if they don't pan out.

## Great Investing Books To Read, Tools To Use

An inexpensive way to learn the investing process is by reading "How to Make Money in Stocks," the best-seller by IBD founder William O'Neil. This investment classic not only takes readers through the stock search and buying and selling process. It gives example after example of how the biggest stock winners formed important chart patterns and began their strong price moves.

"How to Make Money in Stocks" also notes numerous examples of major market bottoms and tops, the most important inflection points for investors, and how to spot the next ones.

A comprehensive tool is [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), available as a separate service. Senior members of IBD's markets team handpick stocks to feature just as they are breaking out. With the help of annotations on the daily and weekly charts, Leaderboard shows subscribers exactly where to buy and sell some of the market's top names.

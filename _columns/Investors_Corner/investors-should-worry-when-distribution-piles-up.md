**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

In July 2011, **Tractor Supply** ([TSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSCO)) broke out of a flat base en route to a new high. The farm supply retailer rose 12% above the 65.10 buy point to a peak of 73.09 on July 7, 2011 **(1)**. Investors had no reason to suspect that anything was wrong — until a few weeks later, when the stock began selling off in heavy volume. By Aug. 8 — just a month after it had hit a new high — Tractor Supply lost a third of its value.

  

What happened?

  

The short answer is that the market had fallen into a [serious correction](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764&nav=IBDUCourse3). The Nasdaq ultimately fell 20%, the technical definition of a bear market. Such a correction is a timely sell signal for your stocks.

  

When a correction happens, growth stocks tend to fall much faster than the overall market. Usually, the leaders will drop 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the market's decline. Investors must anticipate a major downturn coming before the sell-off does lasting damage to their portfolios.

  

The key to doing that? Pay attention to a rush of heavy distribution in the market.

  

A decline of 0.2% or more on the Nasdaq or S&P 500 in volume that's higher than the prior day is called distribution. For the S&P 500, IBD tracks NYSE volume.

  

Rising volume as the market sells off is a sign of heavy selling by institutional investors. So when you see a sharp increase in the number of distribution days, even as the market is rallying, it means that a correction could be just ahead.

  

An occasional distribution day won't hurt an uptrend. But a cluster of heavy selling days — usually five or six or more — within several weeks is a bad sign. Keep a lookout for sell signals in your stocks, with the aim of locking in profits, cutting losses short and raising cash quickly.

  

At the time of its breakout, Tractor Supply was No. 22 in the IBD 50. Its IBD Composite Rating was 98. Its EPS Rating was 95; Tractor had mild yet steady sales gains.

  

The stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- signaled strong institutional demand. In IBD's stock research tables, the Retail sector was ranked No. 2 out of IBD's 33 industry sectors.

  

But distribution began piling up as the market turned choppy. By month's end, the Market Pulse box accompanying the [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) showed that the Dow Jones industrial average had racked up eight distribution days. The S&P 500 had seven, the Nasdaq four. The Market Pulse outlook went from "market under pressure" to "market in correction."

  

A week later, the Nasdaq crashed through its 10-week moving average in heavy volume **(2)**. That same week, Tractor Supply, which began its long run in March 2010, round-tripped its 12% gain and triggered a sell signal. A week later, the stock sliced through a key support line in big turnover, another sell signal. By Aug. 8, it was 33% below its all-time high.

  

Tractor Supply ultimately rebounded with the market and went on to new highs. Investors who sat through the wrenching sell-off would have eventually recouped their losses and then some. But many stocks never recover from such a sell-off.

Short-selling -- the practice of betting that a stock will fall -- can be risky. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, you can control risk smartly by following a set of smart trading rules.


What could happen if you don't follow good rules? Disaster could happen. Just ask Joe Campbell.


According to various media outlets, Campbell said last November that he borrowed and then sold more than \$30,000 worth of stock in KaloBios Pharmaceuticals. He had hoped to buy the shares back later at a lower price and pocket the difference. But the stock rocketed the next day on news that a group of investors took a majority stake in the company.


As a result, Campbell was forced to buy back the shares from his broker, ETrade, at a much higher price. That wiped out the \$37,000 in his trading account and then some. In all, Campbell reportedly lost more than \$140,000.


Not many short sales go as horribly awry as Campbell's. But the practice is risky, since losses can theoretically be infinite.


Those who wish to learn to recognize the classic signs of a stock on the verge of breaking down and to follow sound rules can rack up big profits on the short side. To learn IBD's technique, read the monthly [Short Side column](https://www.investors.com/short-selling/), which now runs on the last Monday of each month. You can search the archives at Investors.com (hover over the "Research" tab on the home page, then click on "Short Selling") to know how to select a good short sale candidate, when to sell, and when to cover the position to nail down a gain or to cut your loss.


For starters, never short a thinly traded micro-cap like KaloBios, since even relatively small trades can spark dramatic movements in price. Also, keep your losses small. A key IBD rule says to cover when a stock rises 7%-8% above the point at which you shorted the stock.


Beyond that, there are telltale signs in a stock's chart that signal that it's on the verge of breaking down after a long advance. These include classic topping patterns such as the [head-and-shoulders pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-head-and-shoulders-chart-pattern-says-time-to-sell/), which looks like the outline of a head and shoulders, with the right shoulder typically just below the left.


Other topping patterns include torpedo sell-offs, breakdowns from late-stage bases and [L-shape patterns](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/how-the-l-shape-pattern-can-help-you-sell-short-for-big-profits/). It's important to note that these patterns are valid only for highly liquid stocks that have made huge advances of 300% to 400% or more in price. IBD offers a [home-study program](http://shop.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/short-selling) that discusses each short-sale scenario in detail.


**Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) started breaking down from a head-and-shoulders pattern in late 2014 after a huge advance from 17 in July 2012 to nearly 159 in November 2014. The run-up was fueled by strong sales of Keurig's single-cup coffee brewers and coffee cartridges, known as K-cups.


The stock plummeted after profit growth slowed sharply, piercing its 10-week moving average in the week ended Nov. 21, 2014. Several rallies back up to the 10-week line helped form the right shoulder. The time to short comes when a stock tries -- and fails -- in its third attempt to retake the 10-week line. For Keurig, resistance at the 10-week line near 119 a share in early May 2015 created an ideal short-sale entry. Volume on the downside was heavy, a sign that institutional investors were bailing out.


By May 7, the short sellers had achieved a 20% gain, the right time to take profits, as growth stocks can rebound quickly. Those who held on longer and had strong conviction were rewarded further as the stock failed several more times to overtake resistance at the 10-week line. Investors were worried about the company's slowing sales growth and uncertainty of success in new product launches.


By late November, the stock hit a low of 38.90, good for a gain of more than 200%. On Dec. 7, 2015, Keurig rocketed 72% to 88.89 on news that a German private equity firm agreed to acquire the company.

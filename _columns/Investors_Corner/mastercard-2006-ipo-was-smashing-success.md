In the stock market, new is much better than old.

Newer companies with new, innovative products are usually preferable to older companies where growth is slowing and market share is shrinking.

Remember, stocks tend to make their biggest moves in the early stages of being a public company. That's when year-over-year earnings growth is usually the strongest — and earnings growth is one of the primary fuels of outstanding price performance.

But there are risks to be aware of in the IPO market.

## When To Buy IPO Stocks: Avoid This Mistake

For starters, avoid buying a new issue right after it has already made a massive price run. The goal for any growth investor is to buy a stock in the [early stages of its run](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) — not the [later stages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/).

If you focus on IPO bases, you won't have that problem. Yet you still want to see a [base form well](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), with quiet action during declines and heavy volume on the upside.

IPO bases come in different shapes and sizes, but **Mastercard**'s ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) chart pattern was pretty straightforward when it broke out in early August 2006.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ICma121119-300x161.jpg)Mastercard doesn't make money by issuing cards or collecting interest on unpaid card balances. That's what banks do. Mastercard makes money by providing networks through which card transactions are processed.

Its stock cleared a shallow, [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) and a 50.73 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) during the week ended Aug. 4. Weekly volume rose sharply from the prior week **(1)**.

At the time, Mastercard's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) was relatively high for an IPO at 75. Its Industry Group Relative Strength Rating was A, on a scale of A-E with A best, and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was B+.

Mastercard was an easy stock to hold after the breakout. Not once did it seriously threaten a break below its 10-week moving average. Nearly one year after the breakout, the stock rallied to a high of 174.60 **(2)** — good for a gain of 244% from the buy point.

## When To Buy IPO Stocks: More Pointers

Focusing on early-stage IPO bases is sound strategy, but a common pitfall for investors is buying an IPO too early — before it has had time to consolidate gains and take a breather after a successful debut. Normally, a proper base takes a minimum of five weeks to form. An IPO base can form in as little as three weeks, and on very rare occasions less.

Investors should also avoid overly speculative IPOs. In these cases, there's often a compelling growth story where the company is talking the talk but not walking the walk. You'll need [great fundamentals](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) to back up the story.

If there is one thing the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/stock-market-today/) does not like, it is unpredictability.  And few periods of time have been less predictable than this year's presidential race.

Investors have contorted their portfolios in attempts to anticipate what might happen with taxes, military spending, health care, the minimum wage and trade tariffs, among many other factors.

So how much of a difference does a president make? Arguments vary. So do presidencies. The office of George W. Bush, in particular, felt the impact of the unwinding tech, telecom and power-generation booms, followed by the 9/11 attacks and, later, the housing and financial system meltdowns. The result: The S&P 500 declined more than 40% across his two terms.

The S&P 500 only took a one-day dive after John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963.  It rebounded within a day and rose 24% during Lyndon Johnson's two-year first term.

There is general agreement that the real growth killer for the stock market is uncertainty. The rapid, orderly transition of power after Kennedy's murder helped quell market fears. That was less the case when Richard Nixon's administration unraveled in 1973-74. The sloppy final acts of that presidency left the S&P 500 down 31% across Nixon's 18-month second term. The index snapped back and rose 27% under Gerald Ford, then an additional 28% during the rocky single-term presidency of Jimmy Carter.

The S&P 500 advanced 118% across the two terms of both Gen. Dwight Eisenhower and Gov. Ronald Reagan. Another governor and two-term president, William J. Clinton, saw the S&P 500 gain 210% on his watch. The S&P 500 has climbed 161% so far under the two terms of Barack Obama.

Economic growth is a separate matter, and growth rates of gross domestic product can vary wildly vs. stock market performance.  In one example, the market dive during Nixon's final two years took place against GDP growth of 5.6% in 1973, followed by a 0.5% contraction in 1974.

The S&P's 12% decline during the first term of the younger Bush, in 2001-05, saw GDP expand at 2.8%. 3.8% and 3.3% in the three years through 2005.

Maybe the bigger and more encouraging news is that over the past 18 presidential terms, the stock market, using the S&P 500 as a gauge, has only declined three times. And the average decline across those three terms, 25%, is far smaller than the average gain of 44% across the 15 rising terms.

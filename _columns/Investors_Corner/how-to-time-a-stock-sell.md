Few investment mistakes are more frustrating than selling a fast-rising stock too early.


Sometimes this happens because the investor is reacting to a previous trade. If the investor bungled a trade by selling too late, it's human nature to bungle the next trade by selling too early.


Trades based on emotions can lead to trouble. That's why rules are crucial. Rules are based on what researchers see most of the time when studying charts.


One way to avoid selling too early is to be aware of the 18-week rule. Research shows that most big winners that break out of a first- or second-stage base will not go into a climax run before 18 weeks. And if the stock makes a huge weekly price gain — the biggest since the breakout — that's no reason to sell if the run-up is less than 18 weeks.


Farm-machinery maker **Hesston** was a turnaround candidate in 1983. The company lost money in 1982, but turned a profit of \$1.95 a share in the second quarter of 1983.


The stock began forming a long, cup-with-handle base in January 1981 and added the handle in July 1983. The base was first stage.


Hesston broke out in big volume, clearing a 12.98 buy point in the week ended July 22, 1983.


Two weeks later, the stock surged 2.12, or 15%, for the week, taking the stock 23% above the buy point. **(1)** An investor might've been tempted to sell. Isn't it wise to take most profits at 20%?


Well, yes, but the quick 20% gain triggered the eight-week-hold rule. Big winners often take long strides early, and it's best to stay in such a stock. Also, the 18-week rule defined the move as way too early to be a sell area.


The stock reached the 18-week mark in mid-November **(2)** without flashing a sell signal. By then, the stock was 41% above the buy point. Rule-based investors were watching for a week that constituted the biggest price gain in the whole run.


It came in week 27 (January 1984), when Hesston gained 2.25, or 10.5%, for the week to 23.75. **(3)** A sell locked in an 83% gain in six months, just before a major decline for Hesston.


Not every winner runs up for 18 weeks or more. Had Hesston flashed sell signals en route, selling would've been in order. Had the stock not triggered the eight-week-hold rule, taking an early profit might have been justified.

At this time of year in many parts of the country, you want to be sure and check the thermometer before you jump out the door in the morning. It could just as easily be 35 degrees or 65 degrees. You want to make sure you're not over or underdressed.

  

The same is true for the stock market.

  

To invest means literally to put on vestments, a word that means garments. It means to clothe yourself in something. Before you wrap your cash up in a stock, you want to have some idea whether the market is lukewarm, red hot or cold as ice.

  

That's why the M in IBD's CAN SLIM system stands for market direction. It's the most critical aspect of smart investing.

  

Is the market in a rally or a downtrend? Is it waiting for a follow-through to confirm an uptrend? Or is it struggling, freighted with a heavy load of distribution days?

  

These are the kinds of guideposts you want to recognize as you decide whether to move into or out of stocks.

  

To be sure, studying the market doesn't mean you have to predict its direction. CAN SLIM only advises that you listen to and understand what the market tells you today, this week, this month.

  

Like all worthwhile pursuits, developing such understanding requires a focused, sustained effort.

  

The most obvious place to start is with IBD's daily column, The Big Picture. The feature gives an overview of the day's market action. It frames that action in the context of the general market's recent trends.

  

Attached to The Big Picture is the Market Pulse. At a glance, this feature gives a continual, concise read on the market's action and outlook, as well as the best and worst performers among top stocks.

  

When the Pulse says "Market in correction," the message to investors is: no new buys. Rotate to cash as you sell holdings. Then sit tight and wait for a follow-through day.

  

A "Market in confirmed uptrend" message signals a follow-through has occurred and the buy zone is open for business. "Uptrend under pressure" hangs out a caution flag. It generally indicates rising distribution — intense selling by large institutions — threatening the market's progress. The message: Be cautious about buying, take some profits and raise some cash.

  

Keep in mind, the market can be cantankerous. It is constantly adjusting to revalue countless aspects of the U.S. and global economies.

  

It is not unusual for a series of daily flinches higher or lower to cause several turnarounds in the status on the Market Pulse.

  

If you feel yourself getting frustrated by such changes, it's time to take a step back. You can't will the market to become less volatile. Rather than stress about directional changes, turn back to your watch list so that you are prepared for the big opportunities that will come.

The market is wallowing in a correction, and many highflying stocks have fallen back to earth.

  

But that doesn't mean investors ought to just curl up in a ball and weep.

  

Instead, it's a good time to look for highly rated stocks that are consolidating in an orderly fashion.

  

That way, when the market gets back into an uptrend, you'll be ready to take advantage of the new opportunities immediately.

  

You'll have a watch list with some promising stocks, as well as a shot at buying leading stocks as they break out.

  

Keep in mind that some leaders manage to break out even before the general market starts moving up in earnest.

  

Consider how longtime leader **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) behaved about a year and a half ago.

  

The general market had spent three weeks in a correction in late 2010, roughly from mid-November through early December. It was a relatively brief period of consolidation, just a time for stocks to catch their breath.

  

IBD's Market Pulse switched back to an uptrend status in early December. It would end up staying in that mode for several months, with occasional shifts down to "uptrend under pressure."

  

When the Market Pulse signaled a correction from mid-November through early December, Priceline moved sideways **1**. The online travel broker was digesting its gains since its powerful breakout in August 2010 **2**.

  

**Delayed Rally**

  

Priceline didn't immediately join in the general market's rally.

  

The stock continued to trade tightly and etch a consolidation resembling a flat base **3**.

  

The possible buy point was at 428.20.

  

Priceline surged past that buy point in the week ended Jan. 7, 2011 **4**. Turnover came in strong, as you prefer to see with any breakout **5**.

  

Given that this was Priceline's second-stage base, and the stock already had enjoyed a strong advance, it would have been fine to take profits once gains reached 20%.

  

That would have come at around 513.84 **6** (20% beyond the ideal entry at 428.20).

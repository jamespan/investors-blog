[Personal Finance Action Plan For 2015](http://news.investors.com/special-report/732755-personal-finance-action-plan-for-2015.aspx)

  

Sometimes in the stock market, just as in life, it pays off to take a few steps back before you go forward.

  

The way to take a few steps back in [the stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) is to take some serious time out to review your past trades. You could dramatically improve the results of your portfolio performance in 2015.

  

It's always fun to see how your good investments worked out. But more importantly, looking back lets you see how and why the bad trades emerged. A sober analysis will give you a leg up for 2015 [personal stock investing strategies for 2015](http://news.investors.com/special-report/732755-personal-finance-action-plan-for-2015.aspx). If you learn how you made your mistakes, you can write a rule about them and vow to always follow it. This disciplined approach will help you avoid making the mistakes again.

  

• **Read the charts.** First, print out [stock charts](http://education.investors.com/ibd-university/452143-charting-the-course.aspx) of your disappointing trades. Mark the day or week when you bought shares and when you sold.

  

Print a chart of the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500, and study the market trend in which you made the trades. Did you tend to buy when the market was falling or flat-lining? Were breakouts from proper buy points fizzling fast? If yes, then write down this rule: I will deploy cash only when IBD's Market Pulse outlook states "confirmed uptrend."

  

Your chances of catching a rising stock are now greater.

  

Note the price and volume of the stocks you buy. Do you home in on cheap shares priced in the single digits? If so, you might want to write a rule in which you focus only on those that trade for at least 30 a share. Also, focus on those with an average dollar volume of \$25 million to \$50 million or more. Institutions — the main drivers of [big stock winners](http://news.investors.com/investing/010215-732941-best-100-stocks-include-biotech-software-semiconductors.htm) — tend to favor higher priced stocks with ample volume.

  

Such a rule would likely have steered you toward big-cap winners such as **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), which has rallied more than 630% from a breakout in early August 2010, or **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), up 85% since a breakout in September 2012.

  

• **Learn new sell rules.** When the market is in the late stages of a bull run, it's sensible to take gains quickly. Instead of waiting for each stock winner to rise 20% or 25% from the proper buy point, start taking gains at 10% to 15%.

  

Avoid round-trips in good stocks. Don't let an 18% gain evaporate to zero or a loss. If you get shaken out of a stock, you can always buy it back when it presents a new buy point.

  

Study the volatility of the stocks you traded. Do they swing as much as 10% or more from weekly low to high on a regular basis? Such stocks tend to chase people out after rushing to new highs. You might consider balancing your wild movers with companies that make IBD's Big Cap 20 (see Tuesday's paper).

  

Are you trading too much? Take a break from all new buys if the number of losing trades begins to exceed your winning ones.

  

Also, study your equity curve. Do it by plotting your monthly account balance on a graph. Over time, is your equity rising steadily and holding up well during long periods? That's ideal. But if the graph looks like a string of hairpin curves, you're more prone to taking too many trades that ultimately erase your hard-earned profits.

  

• **Test yourself.** In his new book "The New Trading for a Living," trading coach Alexander Elder notes that he conducts a brief "self-test" with just five questions to answer before the trading day begins. The results confirm whether or not Elder, a professional trader, is in the right frame of mind to excel.

  

"You, your mind, your mood and your personality are the essential components of trading," Elder wrote. "This is why a quick self-test helps you see whether you should be trading today."

  

• **Check in daily.** One of the most important keys to achieving steady gains and staying in sync with the market is to watch the market every day.

  

It takes only two minutes at most to check IBD's Market Pulse and scan the Big Picture column so that you know when to be in the market.

  

If you don't make such a daily habit, your results will likely suffer.

  

"Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm — to forget to plant in the spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest?" Stephen R. Covey wrote in "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People." "The farm is a natural system. The price must be paid and the process followed. You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut."

  

For [successful investors](http://news.investors.com/investing.aspx), post-trade analysis is part of the price that must be paid.

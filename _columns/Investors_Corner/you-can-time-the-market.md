In the investment journey, you will encounter bear markets. Yes, they will wreak havoc and cause pain to the portfolios of many investors. But note that these bad times will pass and an uptrend will present itself again.

  

Contrary to popular belief, you can know when the [market has likely bottomed](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764) . Nope, you don't need to overlay a bunch of complicated technical indicators on your charts. All you have to do is watch for a follow-through day. You really just need simple price and volume data.

  

Developed by IBD founder William O'Neil, a follow-through tells you that the selling has likely ended and the market has started a new uptrend. It's a green light to buy leading stocks once again.

  

The follow-through signal isn't perfect. Nothing is. So don't immediately get fully invested once a follow-through happens. Also, a follow-through signal will not pinpoint the absolute low in the market.

  

But it's often close. And since the early 1900s, no bull market has ever started without a follow-through day.

  

Use the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500 when scouting a market follow-through. Although a follow-through can take place in the Dow Jones industrial average, use one of the broad-based market indexes instead. The Dow has only large- and mega-cap stocks, and only 30 of them.

  

After a long, hard sell-off in the market, watch first for a higher close. Volume could be higher or lower than the prior session on this day. This is not the follow-through signal itself but a key first step. The first up day tells you that the bleeding has stopped for now. This action marks Day 1 of a rally attempt.

  

The action on Day 2 and Day 3 is irrelevant as long as the index doesn't undercut its recent low. If it undercuts, the rally attempt fails; the market needs to try again. The follow-through signal takes place on Day 4 or thereafter of the rally attempt.

  

Generally, the best follow-throughs take place on Days 4 through 7 of a rally attempt. Yet some follow-throughs have occurred later and worked well.

  

Earlier this year, the Nasdaq put in a Day 15 follow-through on Jan. 8. It took a while to finally get going, but the tech-heavy index eventually did â€” and it pushed to a 15-year high by April.

  

The percentage gain needed for a follow-through signal is a moving target. But generally, the gain should be at least 1% to 1.25%. Volume must rise vs. the prior session; it doesn't need to be above average.

  

Once a follow-through takes place, investors should buy leading stocks that break out of [excellent bases](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735787) . Ideally, investors should already have a watch list of stocks that are in bases and close to buy points already. Read the [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) (today on B3) to stay in tune with what's going on and see if a new uptrend is at hand.

  

Stocks had rough going from 2007 to 2008. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were more than cut in half amid the global financial crisis. The S&P 500 bottomed at an uncanny 666.79 on March 6, 2009 **(1)**.

  

The actual follow-through signal occurred on March 12, or the fifth day of the rally attempt. The benchmark index jumped 4.1% that day **(2)**. Volume rose from the prior session **(3)**.

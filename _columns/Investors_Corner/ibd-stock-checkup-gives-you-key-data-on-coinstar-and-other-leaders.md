To succeed in investing, you have to do your homework. The path to finding the market's top stocks is not an easy one. It takes time, discipline and a lot of patience.

  

Stock Checkup on Investors.com can save you precious time and offers a wealth of information fast. You can find Stock Checkup in the secondary navigation bar under Stock Research.

  

There's a ton of information that investors should look at before placing money on the line.

  

First, the market needs to be in an uptrend. Second, stocks of interest must have strong earnings and sales growth and belong to a top-performing industry group.

  

Investors sometimes have to pore through dozens, even hundreds, of stock charts to find the best base patterns and secondary buy setups.

  

Luckily, Stock Checkup lays out some key information on one page. The feature shouldn't be the final arbiter. Rather, it's a quick filter to see if your target stock has the right stuff in all the key areas.

  

Stock Checkup is laid out in two sections. The first highlights IBD Ratings, which tells you how your candidate stacks up with the other stocks in its industry group.

  

Want to see stocks with the highest EPS or Accumulation-Distribution Ratings? Place your mouse over the percentile bars in each category, then look at the chart on the right.

  

Further below, you'll find a checklist that's coded with the colors from a traffic signal. A green dot means pass, yellow means neutral and red means fail.

  

The checklist tells you the current market outlook and a stock's industry group ranking. Make sure there's a green dot before you start buying stocks.

  

In the fundamentals section, you'll find quarterly and annual earnings, and measures of operating efficiency. Prefer stocks with many or all green dots. Too many yellow or red dots mean it's probably a good idea to pass.

  

The technical performance section offers key price and volume data, such as the stock's price vs. its 52-week high. It also shows trends in fund ownership.

  

**Coinstar** ([CSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSTR)) is up nearly 47% since Jan. 1. The stock passes in most fundamental and technical areas. Coinstar also gets a green dot in "% Change In Funds Owning Stock" and "Quarters Of Increasing Fund Ownership." But the market has a yellow dot.

**Top 10 Investing Myths:** [Sixth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/604007/201203141812/top-10-investing-myths.aspx)

A hundred bucks ain't a lot of scratch these days: half a trip to the grocery store or a day pass to Disneyland with just enough left over for a chili dog and a Coke.

Still, an investor's myth lingers that sayeth a stock above \$100 has already made the bulk of its run and is too expensive to buy. Here's a one-word unraveling of that belief: **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

Investors savvy enough to have grabbed Apple at a 146.50 buy point in a summer 2009 breakout are now sitting on a 327% profit. And while Apple is the most obvious example, it is far from the only stock above \$100 that has run up to monstrous gains.

It is part and parcel of what IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil calls the market's Great Paradox: "What seems too high in price and risky to the majority usually goes higher eventually, and what seems low and cheap usually goes lower."

In some ways, the paradox addresses the divide between value and growth investors. Both are valid approaches, and many investors borrow from both. But the fable is that value investing, because you are buying near what may look like a bottom, is a lower-risk endeavor.

Any stock can fall to zero.

Value investors may have been excited to jump into **Alpha Natural Resources** ([ANR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANR)), for example, as the coal miner crawled off a 20-month low just above 15 in October. They would have been even more excited as the stock scaled up nearly 90% in five weeks.

But a buy-and-hold approach is at the core of value investing. Alpha Resources put that to the test as it gave up most of its run over the next three weeks.

On Tuesday, the coal miner appeared on IBD's New Lows list, back within pennies of its October levels.

None of this suggests you go out and recklessly buy stocks priced above a C-note.

Careful research is always the keystone to proper stock choice. CAN SLIM investors know the drill, starting with strong profit and sales growth, new products or services, a strong industry group and solid sponsorship.

Relative Strength is also crucial. Studies of the greatest stock market winners found that winners, on average, outperformed 87% of the market before they even began their biggest price advances.

Apple was close, with a Relative Price Strength Rating of 83 just before it started its advance in July 2009. It also had a Composite Rating of 98 and an EPS Rating of 94.

Another example right around that same time was **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)). It had an 88 Relative Strength Rating and Composite and EPS Ratings of 99 when it cleared a six-week cup base in July 2009. Buy point: 119.24. Gain for those savvy (and gutsy) enough to make the buy: 502% and counting.

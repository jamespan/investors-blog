**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)


Sometimes, when a leading stock sells off, the big money sees an opportunity to buy extra shares. That leads to a healthy rebound. But what if the recovery is weak and takes place in poor volume?


It tells you something important. It says that many of the best-performing [institutional investors](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735744&sourceid=735749) have lost their appetite for the stock. Maybe you should, too.


Mutual fund and hedge fund managers aren't going to tell you what they're up to or what they think of a certain stock. They don't want rivals to trade ahead of them, jacking up or pressing down the price.


But they can't hide their buying and selling. It's encoded in the daily record of price and volume, on a chart for anyone to study.


Sometimes even the absence of buying tells a story investors need to hear.


Several [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx) that IBD founder and chairman William O'Neil developed are based on the idea that when a great stock advances in poor volume, institutions have lost interest, and the stock might be near a top.


Your job is to watch the recovery for clues that institutional demand is finally drying up.


The clues are in the volume.


Take **Alliance Semiconductor**, founded in 1983 by two veterans of the chip industry, N.D. Reddy and C.N. Reddy.


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company designed memory products for the fast-growing personal computer market. It helped pioneer the fabless model, a now widely used practice of farming out chip design to the firms that built the chips, who then sold them to computer manufacturers. This method gave a company like Alliance the flexibility to quickly shift its focus to whatever products the market demands.


The stock [went public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) at the end of 1993, moved higher, formed a first-stage base and broke in September 1994. It enjoyed participation in a smart rally during 1995 that favored tech stocks and companies on the cutting edge of the PC industry.


But tech giants and the rest of the sector generally got into trouble in mid-July when a long-anticipated sell-off materialized. The previously indestructible **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) dropped nearly 20% over three days.


Alliance was relatively unscathed, powering on to new highs â€” for a while.


On Aug. 2, 1995, the stock dropped 10% **(1)** off a new high. Volume was average. The investor with a big profit would have shrugged it off. But the smart investor would have carefully watched the recovery. The next day, the stock recovered; volume was slightly higher **(2)**.


After that, volume trailed off badly **(3)**. It was [time to sell](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735788&nav=IBDUCourse7). The top tech stocks spent months forming new bases before moving higher. Alliance never reached those heights again.

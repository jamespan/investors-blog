Starbucks' stock served up a case study in 2015 of success not being so much what was achieved as how it was achieved. Plenty of stocks posted sizable gains in 2015, yet they did so either without ideal entries or with unpleasant retreats.

  

Most investors would gladly trade some of a big gain for playability. If a stock is hard to hold, it probably won't be held.

  

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), though, was an easy hold through its rise.

  

The stock began the year in the middle of a flat base. Starbucks broke out Jan. 23 **(1)**, one day after IBD's The Big Picture noted a switch in the Market Pulse to "Uptrend resumes."

  

This is another factor that made Starbucks easy: If a stock breaks out during a market correction, a disciplined investor knows that such breakouts are less likely to work and harder to hold.

  

Because Starbucks broke out with a gap-up (please see a daily chart), the realistic buy point would've been the 43.25 open. (An aggressive investor could've bought a day earlier, when Starbucks bounced off its 50-day line in strong volume, thereby getting in a few points lower.)

  

For those who bought on the gap-up, the stock never fell more than 1% under the opening price, and it rose confidently. Three-weeks-tight patterns emerged in March and twice in June, but Starbucks' normal action was so tight that interpretation was difficult.

  

A three-weeks-tight with action that contrasts with the previous weeks is more likely to reflect institutional support.

  

After the January breakout, Starbucks traveled above the 50-day line, pausing to test it in early April and early August before facing turbulence in mid to late August.

  

Here's the key thing: From Jan. 23 to early August, a chartist would've found no compelling reason to sell the stock. The stock gained 37% during that period, a nice gain in a tough year.

  

Realistically, when would've a disciplined investor have sold?

  

There were several defensible exits.

  

The first was a profit-taking zone when profit hit 20% to 25%, or 51.90 on April 24 **(2)** and 54.06 on June 18 **(3)**. The 20% level was reached on a gap up in heavy volume, which makes it unlikely that the investor would've sold.

  

A gap-up is a clear bullish signal.

  

So those determined to sell in the 20% to 25% profit zone more likely exited at the 25% level.

  

Individual investors who decided to hold past the 20% to 25% profit-taking zone found additional gains. Up to the July 22 close, Starbucks reached a profit level of 31%. Then the stock began showing some peculiar daily action.

  

The stock staged a sharp negative reversal July 24 **(4)**. After rising almost 5%, Starbucks reversed to a 1% gain that day. Volume was heavy, and the stock closed near the bottom of the day's range.

  

Additional negative reversals came on July 27, July 31, Aug. 3 and Aug. 5.

  

How many warning signals does an investor need? Often, the difference between top investors and average investors is how quickly they recognize a change in a stock's character. Starbucks slashed 3% lower Aug. 6 in volume 45% above average ahead of the Aug. 24 flash crash.

Our society loves ratings.

  

Can't decide on whether or not to see a movie? You might check out how many stars critics give it. That new convertible your daughter is dreaming of? You might factor in the grade that car mags give.

  

IBD is fanatical about ratings too. But ratings are just one stepping stone in the path to superior stock profits. They alone should never replace the process of buying the right stock at the right time, let alone judging the right time to sell.

  

A high EPS Rating (say, 90 or higher) or a 95 Composite Rating might feel like a security blanket. Yes, your chances of picking an outstanding stock are much higher.

  

But ratings aren't perfect.

  

IBD's screens for winning stocks put you in the right direction; you are getting a list of elite companies among thousands to pick from.

  

But a rating is like a company balance sheet: It gives you a snapshot of health on a particular day. A stock's price, in contrast, fluctuates every day. The market moves in a basic trend — higher, lower, or sideways — but that trend can switch in a matter of days as well.

  

The right attitude toward IBD's ratings is this: Use them to narrow your distance to the thoroughbreds. But think like a cowboy who's tamed wild horses. You need to know the market's frame of mind and exactly the right time to jump into and out of a stock.

  

A stock's daily, weekly and monthly charts, as well as the market's overall direction, carry just as much weight as a stock's numerical ratings and letter grades. Use them to improve your timing.

  

The Big Picture and the market updates on Investors.com will sharpen your timing.

  

Sure, there could be days when you pick up a copy of IBD, circle a few top-rated names, buy shares, and make nifty gains that week.

  

But in the long run, you want to produce profits consistently.

  

What if you employed "Just trust the ratings" strategy in early May of 2010? The May 10 Market Pulse gave an outlook of a "Market in correction." Distribution days had piled up, and the market swooned during the May 6 Flash Crash.

  

On May 10, **Medifast** ([MED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MED)) was No. 1 in the IBD 100 (now the IBD 50 since Jan. 3). The meal-replacement firm had good reason to be No. 1. It scored a 98 Composite, 98 EPS and 98 RS. Return on equity was 28%. Its average daily volume of around 1 million shares indicated it was an institutional-quality stock. But as the monthly chart shows, Medifast was in the process of making a top after a hefty run. A breakout from a deep base failed **1**. It's now 29% off its highs.

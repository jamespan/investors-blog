Reviewing the performance of **AmTrust Financial Services** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)) in 2014 may bring back painful memories for some investors who bought it last year.

What lessons did the insurer offer?

**1.** Sometimes it's worth getting back into a stock that just shook you out.

**2.** Expect pullbacks to the correct entry point to occur.

**3.**Sometimes a breakout will work even if the base is not 100% perfect.

The property and casualty insurer broke out of two bases last year en route to a pair of decent double-digit gains. But it was an often gut-wrenching ride. And strong fundamentals were marred by a few spotty technical characteristics.

AmTrust began the year working on a deep cup-with-handle pattern. The correction in the base was 35%, a bit beyond the 20% to 33% decline seen in a healthy base.

The left side of the base featured wide-and-loose trading **(1)** , another warning sign. But trading eventually calmed down. The stock's handle **(2)** showed tight closes and a mild decline in light volume, just what you want to see.

Also, the base was a first-stage pattern, which carries lower risk than bases that form later in a stock's advance.

AmTrust showed strong and accelerating profit growth in the three quarters leading up to its breakout. From a 25% increase in profit in Q2 2013, AmTrust posted subsequent increases of 30%, 47% and 68%. Sales growth over that span was also strong, ranging between 61% and 81%.

AmTrust broke out on May 1 (please see a daily chart), jumping 8% and rushing past a 39.74 buy point to 41.91 in massive volume. But trouble soon began.

In four weeks, the stock rose to 47.10 on May 22, up 19%. Investors are advised to take profits when a stock rises 20% to 25% above its buy point, as most tend to consolidate at that point and form new bases.

And that's exactly what AmTrust did.

The stock erased the entire profit in a series of six high-volume declines, triggering a round-trip sell signal on June 2.

It would have made sense to sell before the entire gain turned into a loss. One can always buy a good stock a second time.

For a few weeks, the stock got support near its 10-week moving average. AmTrust slipped below the key support line, but not by much. Then the stock embarked on a long, sideways consolidation that turned into a double-bottom base with a buy point at 46.12. Company fundamentals were strong; EPS growth accelerated even more.

The stock hit a low of 38.25 **(3)** on Sept. 26 but came back strong, rising for three straight weeks and retaking its 10-week moving average in increasing volume.

It cleared the buy point on Oct. 21, soaring 10% in heavy turnover. But again, that's about when the trouble started.

The stock quickly rose to a high of 53.50 on Oct. 28, or 16% above the 46.12 buy point. The very next day, however, AmTrust plunged 13%, triggering yet another round-trip sell rule. It then got support at its 50-day line and retook the buy point Nov. 3 in heavy volume. This offered yet another opportunity to buy.

The stock rose 29% by Dec. 15 to 59.31.

At that point, it paid to obey the 20% profit-taking rule, as the stock again quickly reversed course.

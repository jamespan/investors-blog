The "I" in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) represents one of the key driving factors behind the stock market's advances and declines: the big money.

The big money is also known as institutional investors, so the "I" stands for institutional sponsorship. That refers to ownership of shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions and other big investors. Since their buying and selling account for the majority of trading on the stock exchanges, it's a good idea to have them on your side.

"Buy only those stocks that have at least a few institutional sponsors with better-than-average recent performance records and that have added institutional owners in recent quarters," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

These heavyweights tend to buy thousands of shares at a time. After all, they deploy millions to billions of dollars in the market on behalf of their clients. The pros will usually buy shares in an installment-like frequency, instead of all at once, to avoid running prices up too much. So it can take weeks, or even months, for them to build a full position.

Mutual funds report their portfolio holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter. Investors can access the data on the SEC's [Edgar website](http://www.edgarcompany.sec.gov/).

When researching individual stocks, always check to see if they are owned by institutions. IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a finger on the pulse of institutional activity. The rating range from A to E, with an A pointing to recent net buying by mutual funds and an E indicating recent net selling. A C is neutral, so an A or B is preferable.

The proprietary rating is available in the daily stock tables and minicharts in the print issue, as well as the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) tool on Investors.com. Another useful gauge is the number of funds buying shares -- you'd ideally see an increase from quarter to quarter. Both metrics show up in the Technical Performance section of Stock Checkup, under the "Supply And Demand" header.

Another place to spot what some highly regarded mutual funds are buying (and selling) is in IBD's Funds & Personal Finance section. The first page (today on Page A11) usually includes two big funds' largest U.S. holdings, top new buys and top sells. Scan the lists to see if a stock you're considering buying shows up here.

"A winning stock doesn't need a huge number of institutional owners, but it should have several at a minimum," O'Neil wrote.

The monthly mutual fund special also offers insight into which stocks the top funds are buying. In IBD's May 7, 2014, edition **(1)**, the special section noted **Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) as one of the stocks being bought heavily by top fund managers. Shares of the airline have since staged breakouts from a series of bases and gained as much as 84% from the week ended May 9, 2014 to a December 2015Â high of 87.17.

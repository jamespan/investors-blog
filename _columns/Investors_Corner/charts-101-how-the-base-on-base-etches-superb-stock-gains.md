When it comes to finding [CAN SLIM quality growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), can a pair of bases by the same stock produce a [superb breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/)? Oh yes.

Consider the base-on-base pattern, which strings together two or more separate bases. It appears frequently on the stock market landscape. Why? Sometimes a stock is ready to break out to new highs and does so, but the rally does not achieve [a 20% gain](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) because the greater market is taking a break or even going into a correction. When the market is shaky, stocks have a tougher time going higher. Most stocks follow [the general stock market direction](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).

So when the stock you have bought correctly and researched thoroughly did not produce the 20% profit that you had hoped for, despair not. Watch for a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) to develop on top of the earlier one.

The new base's low can slip into the prior base, but ideally not by much.

**Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) created a pair of [saucer bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/) before breaking out and rallying 25% in 2014.

In the week ended Sept. 6, the Houston-based oil drilling and well development giant moved past an 85.12 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on a [saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/) — a base as as long as an airport runway. (See it in its entirety on an historical weekly chart, as best seen in [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com), IBD's advanced charting and stock screening service.)

## Top Growth Stocks Have Strong Fundamentals And Price Action

Schlumberger's fundamentals heated up. In the second quarter of 2013, earnings per share rose 14%. Not amazing, but the company showed a long record of steady growth. It marked the highest increase in four quarters.

The stock rose seven weeks in a row, up 11.5% to a 52-week high of 94.91 **(1)**. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 staged four distinct pullbacks of 5% to 7% from May 2013 to February 2014. The declines were light, but enough to spark a new price correction in Schlumberger.

Schlumberger sank  back to its previous 85.12 entry **(2)**. Here, it's smart to exit the stock even with a tiny gain. A determined investor can always buy shares again.

The time to buy again arrived several months later. The stock molded another [saucer pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/) that could also be seen as a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). The base's decline: a miserly 10.5%.

Schlumberger's March 24-25 breakout past a new 93.94 handle entry came in big volume. Turnover that week heated up vs. the prior week; the institutions were heavily buying shares.

On July 1, Schlumberger hit a high of 118.76, up 26% and [ripe for a great sell](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).

## Learn From This Base On Base

Let's check out **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) and its successful base on base in 2017.

In June that year, Winnebago cleared a three-month cup without handle with a 35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The base looked odd. The week ended Dec. 23, 2016, when shares reached as high as 39.30, looked like an outlier on the weekly chart. In six weeks, the small cap rose just 6% from the 35 [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

But in August 2017, Winnebago formed a solid new [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) that sat atop the deeper, wide and loose first base. Winnebago traded tightly as it fell no more than 10.9% from head to toe. Volume was as dry as sun-baked dirt in all three down weeks within the base.

## Winnebago's Profile At The Breakout

Winnebago shifted the stock into higher gear in early September, coasting past a 37.30 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) (a dime above the base's high of 37.20) during a five-week win streak. Volume ballooned sharply in four of those five weeks.

The stock showed a 93 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), a 94 EPS, 91 RS, A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) and B for Accumulation/Distribution. The Building sector ranked No. 5 out of 33 sectors in the [IBD stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). Check these ratings for any stock in IBD's database by going to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-winnebago-industries-inc-wgo.aspx).

By Dec. 20, Winnebago hit as high as 58.65, up 57%.

Now, the stock is aiming to become a market leader again. Shares recently shot past a 40.71 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [well-formed cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).

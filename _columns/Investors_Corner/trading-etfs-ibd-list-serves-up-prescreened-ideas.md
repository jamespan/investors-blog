Is it possible to trade ETFs like stocks? And to do so profitably on a consistent basis?
The short answer is yes.

Investors can use chart analysis as taught at [IBD University](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/getting-started/) and the Investor's Corner to spot exchange traded funds forming the same type of bullish patterns found in winning stocks. IBD's ETF Leaders column is one place where readers can learn about ETFs shaping good charts.

The advantage with this column is that the ETFs discussed are already in a screen designed to find the best-performing funds. From that pool, IBD chooses the ones that are in favorable charts and discusses them in the column, today on Page A18.

IBD's ETF Leaders is basically a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the market. A mathematical algorithm selects ETFs based on relative price strength and other ratings. Adjustments are made for market trends and conditions periodically. The list can vary from just a few ETFs to more than 20, depending on how those factors are shaping up.

Updated each month, ETF Leaders has no preference for sector, region, capitalization or other factors. What matters more than anything is the performance metrics, which have been backtested. The [current list](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/sector-rotation-etfs-nov-08-2016/) includes emerging market, chip and mining ETFs.

Investors who wish to research ETFs further can look up a chart at Investors.com by typing in the symbol in the search box found in the upper right of most of the website's pages.

The usual rules of chart analysis apply to ETFs: Buy on breakouts past proper buy points; don't buy the ETF if it is already extended more than 5% above the entry; take most of your profits at 20%; and cut losses at 7% to 8% or even less, especially when market conditions weaken.

Due to a rangebound stock market since August, many of the ETFs in the screen have been basically flat. Yet, a few have made superior advances.

On Sept. 9, IBD's story discussed the VanEck Vectors Coal ETF ([KOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KOL)), which had pulled back near the 50-day moving average at the time.

A few days later, shares in the ETF share rose from support at the line. At Wednesday's peak, the ETF surged 36.5% from the day of the Sept. 9 article.

On June 24, the column highlighted iShares MSCI All Peru ([EPU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPU)), which was forming a base with a 31.52 buy point. The fund climbed as much as 13% from the entry until it started basing again in August.

Those trading ETFs should also follow sell rules. A sharp break of support at the 50-day moving average, for instance, is just as good a signal as it is with regular stocks.

The Vanguard Telecommunications Services ([VOX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VOX)) rallied 8% from the 94.25 buy point of a flat base. A sell-off since July has brought the ETF back below the entry.

Investors had a chance to get out with a modest profits Aug. 12, when shares broke below the 50-day moving average in the highest volume in more than a year. That was a sell signal.

With weight training, running or any intense exercise, you go through an exhaustion curve that starts with high energy and ends with fatigue.




Stocks go through the same curve, and here are four ways you can tell when to sell stocks to maximize your profits before the gas runs out.


These signs of fatigue often show up before stocks make decisive sell signals, such as a sharp break of support at a certain price level. So they serve as an early warning that put you on alert and help you sell before things get worse.


**New highs in weak volume:**The idea is that while a stock continues to climb, there are fewer institutional buyers willing to pay the higher share price. With the ground softening under its feet, a stock is vulnerable to big losses.

CLOSE




This can happen frequently on a day-to-day basis, and may not mean anything. But when it happens over a number of weeks, there's reason for concern.


Use a [weekly chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) and watch for declining volume as the stock keeps rising over several weeks.

In April, **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) was on a tear, up nearly 50% from a powerful [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) Jan. 24. In the six weeks before its peak, even as shares continued to climb **(1),** weekly volume kept going down **(2)**. This classic divergence foreshadowed Xilinx's woes. The chip company plummeted April 25 **(3)** after a [disappointing earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/xilinx-earnings-q4-2019-xilinx-stock/). A [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) is forming, but Xilinx still faces a long journey to recovery.


When To Sell Stocks: Weak Closes, Relative Strength
---------------------------------------------------


**Frequent closes near session lows:** With this signal, you'll observe that stocks open higher and hold their gains much of the session. But by the close, the share price sinks and most of the day's work is wasted.


If this starts happening day after day, the stock is telling you that investors are selling into strength. Like new highs in low volume, this is a stealthy way in which large investors start moving out of a stock.


**Weakening relative strength:** If the [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) falls below 70, consider taking profits. A leading stock should never be below an 80 RS Rating, let alone 70.


Another way to spot this problem is with the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/apple-trillion-value-stocks/). Study the line (it's plotted in blue below the price bars in IBD and [MarketSmith charts](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks)) to identify weakening stocks. It is especially troublesome when the RS line slopes downward while the share price is trending higher or is flattening.


**A poor recovery:** Stocks that make sizable advances sometimes will pull back in heavy volume. The important element to watch is how the stock recovers. It's a bad sign if the [rebound occurs in weaker volume or price gains that pale in comparison](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-stocks-low-volume-sell/) with the decline. The recovery may last shorter than the period of decline.



"Sell on the second or third day of a poor rally," [IBD founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "It may be the last good chance to sell before trend lines and support areas are broken."

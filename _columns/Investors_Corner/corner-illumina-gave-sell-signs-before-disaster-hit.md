All stocks are risky. It doesn't matter if it's a blue chip or an institutional favorite with solid earnings growth. They can all be dangerous.

**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) is a prime example. The former leader has plunged well below its July high.

The San Diego, Calif.-based maker of genetic analysis tools had several advantages going for it.

Illumina is widely considered the leader in its field. Its HiSeq 2000 analysis systems dominate the market, with an estimated 80% of market share, according to Deutsche Bank Securities.

The firm's earnings bolted 18% to 76% in the latest five quarters. Sales growth ranged from 31% to 50% over the same period.

Illumina's chart action had a number of positives. It was in a second-stage base, not a late-stage pattern. It had tight action. The stock's Relative Strength line was strong. And the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating jumped to a B+ from a D+ by the time of its breakout on July 5.

Previously, the stock had cleared a 71.16 buy point from a cup-with-handle base April 26 and rose 8% before settling into its new base. Since the gain was less than 20%, the new pattern was deemed a base on base.

Illumina wrapped up the latter part of its base-on-base pattern in early July, giving a fresh buy point at 76.91. The stock broke out in volume 52% higher than usual **1**, but didn't show any follow-through.

The next day saw Illumina hit a new high, only to fade and close flat **2**. Then the stock closed below the 76.91 buy point July 7 **3** and lost more ground over the next few sessions.

On July 15, the stock closed below its 50-day moving average, but volume was below average **4**. The next day, Illumina triggered the 8% sell rule. This is the golden rule that will always save you from catastrophic losses.

Illumina had a mild recovery later, but that quickly gave way. The stock again lost its 50-day moving average July 25, another key sell rule.

Things took another turn for the worse two sessions later.

On July 27, the stock dived 18% and sliced its 200-day moving average in more than six times average trade on the company's weaker-than-expected earnings and sales forecast **5**. Illumina is still trying to stabilize after losing two-thirds of its value.

Taking the contrarian view may pay off with the bulls-vs.-bears ratio and some other psychological market indicators. But when buying stocks, going against the grain might not be your best bet.

That's where the 'I' in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/) comes into play. It stands for institutional sponsorship, or the shares of any stocks owned by mutual funds and other big players.

"It takes big demand to push up prices, and by far the biggest source of demand for stocks is institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies ... and educational institutions," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "These large investors account for the lion's share of each day's market activity."

They typically have upwards of millions to billions of dollars to invest on behalf of their clients. Since they often buy thousands of shares at a time, they could take a few weeks or more to build up a full position. Otherwise, they risk running up a stock price too quickly.

By comparison, an individual investor isn't likely to make a big impact on a stock's price action. That's why it's important to pay attention to what the big money has been doing.

Your fundamental checkup of a potential buy candidate should include ownership by at least a few top-rated funds. Newer, more speculative companies tend to have less sponsorship than the blue chips. However, if the number of funds holding shares is growing rapidly, that's positive.

Since 2004, mutual funds have been required to provide a quarterly report of their holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those data are made available about six weeks later.

What is just as important as a rise in the number of institutional sponsors in a stock? It's the quality of the mutual funds and other big shareholders.

IBD can help investors find stocks with institutional sponsorship, both in the print edition and online at Investors.com.

Every Friday in the Your Weekly Review feature, the tables note a top-rated mutual fund with a big position for each stock.

In the monthly mutual fund special section, see the list of highly ranked mutual funds' top buys and sells. The table above shows some of the leading stocks from the Jan. 7 special that showed up among new buys by top-performing mutual funds.

At [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) on Investors.com, scroll down to the Technical Performance section to view the percentage change in the number of funds that own a stock, as well as the number of quarters of increasing fund ownership.

Ideally, both figures will show increases. If the number of funds owning a stock is decreasing, you'll want to find out why the big money is unloading shares.

There are a couple of other ratings under the same section that can help you gauge the level of institutional demand, too.

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates the degree of net buying or selling by mutual funds. An A or B means they are net buyers, while a C is neutral. The up/down volume ratio indicates demand for shares â€” a ratio greater than 1.0 implies positive demand for the stock.

Most writers establish themselves in journalism by conforming to conventional wisdom.


Tom Wolfe defined his celebrated career by defying it.


"There are people who feel hidebound by certain things," Wolfe, the author of such runaway best-sellers as "The Right Stuff" and "Bonfire of the Vanities," told IBD. "I never felt that way. I remember thinking at the age of 14 that I was going to be a hot number."


So hot, his books have sold millions of copies.


Wolfe, now 82, grew up in Richmond, Va., with supportive parents. His father, an agronomist, put out a journal called the Southern Planter, which stoked young Tom's interest in print. It also helped, he said, that he had "aunts who told me that I was wonderful."


**Path To Riches**


Wolfe knew right away that writing was his vocation. He also knew he needed a regular source of income. Little did he know that he would one day, as a writer, be commanding book advances as high as \$7 million.


So, after graduating from Washington & Lee University in Virginia — where his writing already foreshadowed his trademark colorful style and iconoclasm (he titled his undergraduate thesis "A Zoo Full of Zebras: Anti-Intellectualism in America") — he pursued a Ph.D. in American studies at Yale University. He dived into sociology, literature, economics and American history. His dissertation was on communist activity among American writers in the 1930s.


He got the doctoral degree, but fortuitously decided, while he waited for a teaching job to open up, to try his hand at reporting. In 1956 he landed at the Springfield Union, an obscure newspaper in Massachusetts. Later he joined the Washington Post as a Latin American correspondent and metro reporter.


He never returned to academia. Journalism was far more fun, he recalls. But the graduate school experience proved immensely useful in his journalism. It gave him an edge over less learned colleagues, fueled many of his hunches about American life and added intellectual weight to his reporting.


"I learned from studying Max Weber, a 19th-century German sociologist, about the concept of status, which is a much more useful concept than class," he notes.


The subject of status became a permanent theme in his journalism, as he found meaning in minute details — sartorial, financial, aesthetic — that other journalists overlooked. Often wearing his signature white suit, Wolfe would report on society, both high and low.


His exposure to literature in graduate school had given him a fresh lens with which to approach this kind of journalism. It occurred to him that if he wrote his articles like chapters in a novel, "readers would have to turn the page," he recalls.


This innovation — novelistic devices to enliven objective reporting — radically changed American journalism, making it far more literary, imaginative and less staid.


Wolfe was known as one of the architects of this "new journalism" and under its banner produced an endless stream of hit books from the 1960s onward: "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test," "The Pump House Gang," "Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers," "The Purple Decades," "In Our Time," "Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine."


**From Letter To Winner**


Far from sinking his career, Wolfe's willingness to experiment — with new forms of dialogue, punctuation marks, musical language and humor — sealed it.


Indeed, one of his first major publishing coups, ["The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,"](http://www.tomwolfe.com/KandyKolored.html) a story about the world of customized cars in 1960s California, started off not as a formal article but as a conversational letter.


Suffering from writer's block and a fast approaching deadline, Wolfe sent an anxious editor his reporting notes in an epistolary form. The editor loved the informal tone, took off the letter's salutation and ran the notes contained within the letter largely unchanged.


**Good Ol' Writing**


In addition to his stylistic originality, Wolfe wowed readers with his knack for compressing fresh reporting into a devastating word or witty phrase, many of which have entered into the American lexicon, such as "good ol' boy."


That came from Wolfe's 1964 Esquire article, "The Last American Hero," on Junior Johnson, a North Carolina stock car racer.


"Tom is a multifarious talent with a capacity for finding just the right terminology for his time — the Me Decade, the Me Generation, the Right Stuff," said R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., editor in chief of the American Spectator magazine. "He writes with comic wit and deep seriousness. He is one of the few great talents of our age."


Perhaps Wolfe's most well-known phrase, "radical chic," came to him after reporting on the New York elite's fawning embrace of the Black Panthers in the 1960s.


Wolfe, while strolling through the offices of Esquire, saw on David Halberstam's desk an invitation to a party for the Panthers at the posh Park Avenue duplex of musical composer Leonard Bernstein and his wife. Though not invited, an enterprising Wolfe RSVP'd anyway, and sure enough the clueless party planners let him in.


The result was what Wolfe calls the funniest scene he ever witnessed, as felons mingled with the upper crust of New York society.


That Wolfe classic appeared in New York magazine in 1970.


He credits such relentless reporting for his success and urges young writers to eschew navel-gazing graduate programs for on-the-ground reporting. The quality of the material, not a scribe's ethereal talent, makes a piece great, he argues.


It was through persistent reporting on America's space program over the course of six years that he collected material for what became "The Right Stuff," his 1979 book that turned into the four-Oscar-winning movie of 1983.


Though Wolfe is perhaps known largely for his novels, such as "A Man in Full," he has always seen himself first and foremost as a journalist, which is the description on the name plate that sits on his desk in New York City.


Even his reputation as a biting satirist, he says, derives not from "setting out to write a satire" but from careful reporting, which inevitably turns up grimly comic details.


"The Bonfire of the Vanities," his 1987 novel about a race trial in New York City, had its roots in reporting. Wolfe found that truth is not only stranger than fiction, but also sells better than most fiction.


The book, which drew upon such real-life figures as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, sat on the New York Times best-seller list at No. 1 for two months and sold almost 3 million in hardback and paperback copies.


**Marriage And Production**


Wolfe married Sheila Berger — former art director at Harper's magazine — in 1978 and has two children, Thomas and Alexandra, who writes for the Wall Street Journal.


While many of his contemporaries have died or retired, Wolfe keeps writing. He tries to churn out 1,200 words a day.


He has a nonfiction book, titled "The Kingdom of Speech," coming out in 2014. Like "The Painted Word," his 1975 skewering of modern art, this forthcoming book is sure to make a splash, as it addresses another taboo subject the elite doesn't want him to touch — Darwin's theory of evolution.

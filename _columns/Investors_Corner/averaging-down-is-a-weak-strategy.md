**Top 10 Investing Myths:** [Third In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/604007/201203141812/top-10-investing-myths.aspx)

One investing approach that all traders ought to think over is "averaging down."

This means buying a stock, watching it drop and then buying more shares, resulting in a lower average price. You might hear people tell you that averaging down is a great idea, but in fact it's generally a risky way to operate.

These folks will say something like: "If you liked RIM at 64, then you should love it at 54," referring to BlackBerry smartphone maker **Research In Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)).

That makes some sense, but here's another way to think about it that could save you some pain: If a stock has fallen below your purchase price, then at that point it's quite simply a losing investment.

And that means buying more shares could amount to throwing good money after bad, as the saying goes.

Let's say you had bought RIM in January 2011, as the stock cleared a possible buy point at 64.04 **1**.

There were some flaws with this breakout, such as an overly deep base, but you jumped in anyway.

In any case, the breakout didn't provide much upside, and pretty quickly you would have had an opportunity to average down.

And this example shows why averaging down is often a bad strategy. RIM continued to drop, so you really would have been throwing good money after bad if you added to your position in March **2** or April **3** or later.

You should have been selling your original position to avoid further losses, rather than adding to it. RIM tripped some key IBD sell rules, such as by falling 8% below 64.04 and penetrating its 10-week and 40-week moving averages.

Also, there's a big opportunity cost. By keeping your money in a dog, you're losing the chance to invest in a market leader.

There are some rare instances in which an IBD-style investor might end up buying additional shares at a lower price.

For example, sometimes a leading stock will stage a proper breakout, then execute its first pullback to and rebound from its 10-week line. You could buy shares at the breakout, then potentially purchase more at a lower price as the stock rebounds.

**Texas Capital Bancshares** ([TCBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCBI)) provided an example of this type of unusual action with its behavior in December 2011.

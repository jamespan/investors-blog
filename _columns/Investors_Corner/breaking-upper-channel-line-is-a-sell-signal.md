**Sell Winners Like A Pro:** [Second In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/611488/201205211612/how-to-sell-winners-like-a-pro.aspx)

  

Walking is better than running away, Willie Nelson sang in his 1974 tune "Phases and Stages," and crawling ain't no good at all.

  

In spite of all the wisdom in his songwriting, Willie's a guy who's always struggled to follow his own advice.

  

The same is true for countless investors who get caught flat-footed, watching gains erode away to crud when their winning stock breaks down.

  

What's the wisdom they're ignoring? A long list of sell signals, particularly the ones that leading stocks flash before their winning runs collapse.

  

One of the more unique signals is the violation of an upper channel line. The rule can be a bacon-saver for investors who learn how to use it. It says sell a stock that goes through its upper channel line after a huge run-up.

  

To draw an upper channel line, go back four or five months on a weekly chart and run a straight line across at least three highs.

  

If it closes in the lower half of the weekly range, that's even more reason to be bearish.

  

China-based **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) shredded its upper channel line in April last year after a quick, eight-month run. The Internet portal blasted out of an eight-month cup with handle in September 2010 **1** (entire base not shown on chart).

  

It rose sharply above the 46.02 buy point, pulling back to test 10-week support only once during the run. The stock broke the 10-week line in very heavy trade twice during this pullback.

  

One of those cuts occurred in the stock's strongest downside selling action since February 2005.

  

After the pullback, Sina's gains accelerated, averaging a 9% gain in each of the next four weeks **2** and ending each week at the very top of its trading range.

  

The fifth up week, begun April 18 **3**, opened with two big gains in heavy trade. These pierced an upper channel line drawn through the weeks ended Aug. 6, Dec. 10 and Jan. 14.

  

Investors would have been double- and triple-checking that line. Winning runs often last 12 to 18 months. Sina had violated its upper trend line in a fraction of that time.

  

But Sina had already gained 170% before the week started. Also, the general market was also under pressure, with the S&P 500 in retreat after notching a May 2 high.

  

On April 19, Sina closed just above the session's halfway point, trading 267% above its average volume. It then pulled back in heavy trade, ending the week just below its midpoint â€” another warning.

  

Sina behaved as though it might attempt to recover for nearly five months, before finally breaking down in late September.

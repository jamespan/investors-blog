Your mom might have told you to never judge people by their looks. But it's OK to do that with stocks.

  

Investors should be discriminating against bases that are V-shaped. In many cases, these are bad and they can bring about other sell signals.

  

Just because a stock with strong fundamentals shapes a base doesn't mean that it's an automatic buy. You still have to pore over the stock's chart and decipher the good and the bad on its price-and-volume action.

  

One pitfall in a base is a V-shaped appearance. This may look like good action as the stock stages a fast recovery after selling off. But sometimes this type of action is akin to being too fast, too furious. This is not healthy.

  

V-shaped bases don't allow a stock to go through a more natural correction. After a sharp pullback, it's good to see a stock consolidate for two or three weeks to wear out the remaining weak holders. This creates a better foundation and results in a U-shaped pattern.

  

While a cup or cup-with-handle base can be as short as six or seven weeks, respectively, the bases of some of the biggest stock market winners have taken months or more to form. **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) cleared a five-month cup with handle in January 1999 and staged an astronomical run.

  

**SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) blasted out of a 10-month cup-with-handle pattern in 2006 and more than quadrupled before topping.

  

Sometimes in a V-shaped base, a stock will fall hard for a couple of weeks and then rally for a couple of weeks of gains into new-high ground. This fast recovery into new highs is a sell signal and means that a stock could be topping.

  

At times, the pullback will send the stock to its 10-week moving average, typically in heavy volume. This two weeks down and two weeks up sell signal generally occurs after a long uptrend.

  

Keep watch for variations of this sell signal. Sometimes it can be one week down, followed by two or three weeks up to a new high.

  

In late October 2007, **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) fell for three straight weeks **(1)**, but found support at its 10-week moving average. The leading maker of robotic surgical systems then rose for three weeks in a row. The result: a faulty V-shaped base.

  

The good times didn't last, as Intuitive Surgical soon reversed lower and slumped 37% over the next few weeks before getting support at its 40-week line **(2)**.

A choppy market is an uncertain market, and a time when investors need to shift strategies.


Maybe you've had a good year so far, with most of your stocks turning out 20% or better gains. Maybe you are just starting with high aims and are confident that the market is set to move higher.


In either case, distribution days can quickly stack up against the major indexes. A stalling market can rapidly turn into a correcting market.


Don't let comfort or overconfidence keep you from adopting the proper stance. One of the key shifts in strategy is to ratchet down your expectations on gains.


In a healthy market, you might normally shoot for a minimum 15% or 20% gain. If the ride gets rough, sell at 10%.


If things get even more dicey, tamp your expectations even further â€” a 5% gain in a tough market is a win. And a 5% gain, or even a tiny loss, hands down beats being trapped in a correcting stock, waiting to see whether it will allow you to recover lost capital.


This is especially true if the market turns up, follows through and launches another uptrend. Taking small gains is more likely to leave you cash-ready, in a positive state to tap breakout stocks at the start of a new uptrend.


The need for caution is doubled if the market turns choppy during earnings season.


Let's say you bought **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) coming out of a flat base at 36.20 last year in early September. The market was in an uptrend, and Align quickly ran up 10%. Then it pulled back as the market turned choppy and began racking up distribution days.


By late September, investors reading the Big Picture saw that the S&P 500 was demonstrating stalling action and growing signs of heavy institutional selling.


At that time, Align was nearly 10% off its all-time peak of 39.82, but holding above its 50-day line. All stock holders without a significant price cushion should have been on watch.


Align bounced higher in the first couple days of October, but it was clear that the overall market was having trouble. Distribution days were mounting; market gains occurred in weak volume.


Align flashed no real sell signs, but showed signs of struggle. It tried to stab higher in weak volume Oct. 5 and could not match its high. **(1)** Volume was weak and it reversed lower. As the stock fell back to test 50-day-line support, the market outlook shifted to "Uptrend under pressure" after the market closed on Oct. 9.


The next day, the market fell hard again. IBD's Market Pulse switched the outlook into a correction. That was a red alert.


When the stock pushed almost 6% above the buy point in flat volume on Oct. 16, it was a good time to take profits at 5% to 6% and call it a day. **(2)** Q3 results were due out the 17th. A weak report (EPS up just 4%, sales up 8%) set shares through their 50-day line in massive trade. It collapsed 20% the next session.

Whether you're training for a marathon or going camping, being ready can make a world of difference.

The same is true for the stock market. Investors should always have a watch list of fundamentally and technically sound stocks ready to go. Whether the market is in rally mode or in a correction, being prepared is key.

You always need to do some homework if you want to be successful in the market. And having a watch list is especially important in a bull market, as you don't want to buy just any stock, but the very best names with red-hot earnings and sales growth that have set up picture-perfect bases.

The market will not wait for you. So you have to be ready.

At times, the market environment may not be right for buying stocks. But that's no excuse to stop updating your watch list. When the market is in correction mode — as it is today — use that time to work on your watch list. Most great stocks will form bases during corrections.

There's a wealth of resources in IBD and Investors.com that can point you to companies with market-dominating products and services. In print, you can get ideas from the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/etables/default.aspx) in Monday and Wednesday's newspaper, [Big Cap 20](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-big-cap-20.htm) (published on most Tuesdays) and Your Weekly Review (Fridays).

Stocks that make these lists are pre-screened for certain growth and technical criteria. Pay attention to those at or near buy points. Also read the accompanied stories for important themes.

Also pore over the stocks in [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing/stock-spotlight.htm) (today on page B11) and Sector Leaders (page B9). Both lists offer names that have greatly outperformed the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.

On Investors.com, you can get ideas on leaders moving in big volume by checking out Stocks On The Move. This feature can give you a heads-up on what's breaking out in heavy volume.

Investors.com also showcases a number of stock screens in [Screen Center](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?nav=ResearchSC) . [MarketSmith](www.marketsmith.com) also has a barrage of screens, and you can create your own, but it requires a separate subscription.

There is really no right or wrong way to build a watch list. The important thing is that you do it and keep it up to date. You don't have to update it every day. Generally, this is something you can do on weekends.

Go to Investors.com and try the My Stock Lists feature. It lets you build up to five watch lists with up to 50 symbols in each.

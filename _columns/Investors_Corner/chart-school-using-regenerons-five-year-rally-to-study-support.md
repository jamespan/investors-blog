IBD descriptions of stock charts will often say a stock is "finding institutional support," testing support by big funds, or has lost support among large money managers.

The concept of institutional support is not one of the first things you need to understand as an investor. But it quickly becomes a helpful asset in assessing the technical strength of a stock. Being aware of this concept also helps you identify critical transitions in a stock's chart direction.

Support refers to levels in a stock's price that generally appear to trigger buying by institutions or other large investors. This support may occur around a specific price level, or along a moving average price line such as the 50-day or 200-day moving averages.

When a stock is said to "have support," powerful shareholders are either building positions or actively interested in seeing that the stock's chart maintains certain levels. In a stock's chart, this means a stock tends to hold above a certain price point, or above a key technical tool such as a 10-week moving average.

When the stock dips back to a support level, the price will generally rebound, often with at least a mild increase in volume as one or more large-scale buyers step in to prop the price. This action creates the [follow-on buy opportunities](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) called rebounds from support, or [rebounds from the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-add-the-10-week-pullback-to-your-playbook/).

## Institutional Support And The Opposite Behavior

The study of support and resistance is also often applied to the study of behavior and timing of the overall market level, most notably in methods such as the Elliott Wave Principle or Fibonacci retracements.

A good example of a stock that enjoyed, and then lost, long-term support at its 10- and 40-week lines was **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)). The stock broke out in November 2010 to begin its multiyear run.

Regeneron lists many hundreds of mutual funds and hedge funds among its shareholders. But it has also included among its major institutional shareholders French drugmaker **Sanofi** ([SNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNY)). Sanofi and Regeneron partnered on key drug development deals, in antibodies and immune-oncology, beginning in 2007.  In addition to funding the partnerships, Sanofi invested heavily in Regeneron shares, reportedly holding as much as 22.5% of the company.

## Sanofi Also Invested Heavily In Regeneron

As the Regeneron-Sanofi partnership developed, and as Regeneron marketed its core drug, the retinal treatment Eylea, outside the U.S. through its partnership with Germany's **Bayer** ([BAYRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAYRY)), the stock rode 10-week line support early in 2011. During two large corrections in price, Regeneron found buying support at its 40-week moving average during the year.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ICregn110617-1024x551.png)Shares trended higher, breaking out of bases in the months of January, August and November in 2012. The 10-week line cradled most of the run through 2012 and 2013.

Late in 2013 and into 2014, Regeneron once more dipped back to test its 40-week line in two separate consolidations **(1)**. It broke out again and rode support at its 10-week line to late August of 2015.

The drugmaker by now had logged two quarters of declining earnings, although revenue growth continued to accelerate. Investors had carefully been monitoring its development pipeline. Yet all indications were that the company had a rich supply of new opportunities. Still, earnings continued to slip through the end of 2015, before rebounding sharply across 2016.

In the third week of August 2015, Regeneron broke below support at its 10-week line in heavy trade **(2)**, sending a sell signal.

## The Top In Regeneron Stock's Rally

Six weeks later, it dove through its 40-week moving average in even heavier volume, signaling investors that institutions were no longer willing or able to prop up the stock in the face of heavy selling. Such action produced [a valid double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). But as the weekly chart shows, Regeneron's breakout past a 557.97 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) came in relatively low volume compared to the sell-off within the base.

The stock eventually rolled over **(3)**. Regeneron triggered the [golden rule of selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) (cut losses at 7% to 8% below your purchase price or less). That commenced a multiyear consolidation.

Selling short when a vaunted leader finally begins its breakdown is one of the most psychologically challenging yet satisfying trades. So how is it done?


The previous day's [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) walked you through the head-and-shoulders pattern, which can take as long as seven months to build.


Today's column shows when to capitalize on a stock that is melting down fast after its breakout from a late-stage base fails.


This opportunity requires multiple chart-reading skills.


One, know how to count bases.


Three or more bases tend to ripen a stock's chances of becoming a great short. But some superior stocks will rise even after breaking out of a third, fourth or even fifth base. Some IBD Sector Leader stocks can fool short sellers in this way.


Next, spot flaws in the late-stage base. The more, the better.


Then see if the stock breaks out but quickly nosedives. If it does, focus on the correct entry point. Typically, it's when the stock falls 7%-8% below the base's proper entry. If that is, say, 50, the short entry would be 46 to 46.50.


The stock may also be cutting through its 50-day or 10-week moving average.


If volume is sharply up, so should be your conviction.


**Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) — as noted in the [Jan. 5, 2015, edition](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/010215-732986-how-to-sell-short.htm) of IBD's monthly column "The Short Side" (published the first Monday of each month) — ran up 320% from August 2010 to an 80.91 peak in September 2014.


The rally really got cooking in July 2013, when the oil explorer burst out of a first-stage base at a split-adjusted 44.19 and rose 38% to a high of 60.89. The second-stage base was formed from October 2013 to February 2014 **(1)**. Continental's second-stage base showed just an 18% decline and a 60.99 entry. It broke out again and rallied 31%.


A third base formed, this time an eight-week flat base with a 79.72 entry. The breakout showed pale weekly volume **(2)**, a no-no. Then, as the stock reversed and headed below its 10-week moving average at 75.45, volume soared **(3)**.


That was the moment to sell short. It was also the time for buyers at the breakout to cut losses at 7%-8% near 74.14. Four weeks later, the stock dipped to as low as 55.41 in heavy volume.


Short sellers could have covered during the week ended Oct. 10 for a gain of anywhere between 17% and 36%.


In most cases, aim to cover at the 20%-to-25% profit range.

Rome wasn't built in one day, and wealth takes time to accumulate. In the stock market are some top-rated names that investors may want to hold for the long term. For ideas on great stocks to put in your portfolio for the long haul, take at look at the Income Investor column (today on B9).

  

IBD isn't just about covering the fastest-growing, highly volatile stocks. There is money to make from stocks in the [Income Investor](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-income-investor.htm) , published every day.

  

First, check stocks on the Dividend Leaders screen, a table that runs to the left of the column. Many of them are old, established companies that have seen their best days of growth behind them. They are still making money, but growth has slowed to a trickle.

  

Firms such as **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **Philip Morris** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)) and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) have made the screen recently.

  

Sometimes, faster-growing companies make the screen. **U.S. Silica** ([SLCA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLCA)) did it back in late November of 2013. The [maker](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx). If you already have a large gain, don't give everything back and exit with an 8% loss.

  

Instead, watch out for sell signs such as breaking above a channel line and climax tops. Also consider selling if a stock breaks a major uptrend line or slices its 50-day or 10-week moving average in big turnover.

  

The Nov. 5, 2012, edition of the Income Investor featured **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)). The coffee giant raised its quarterly payout. The column also highlighted its strong earnings and other business fundamentals.

  

Starbucks was building the right side of a new base. It would go on to form a cup-with-handle base with a 56.10 buy point **(1)**.

  

The stock cleared that entry in the week ended Jan. 25, 2013, but didn't get far before forming what turned out to be a new flat base with a 57.37 buy point.

  

Starbucks broke out again in the week ended March 8. Volume bulged above average **(2)**. Although it pulled back soon after, it eventually perked up and rallied 29% by early August **(3)**. Shares doubled by July 2015.

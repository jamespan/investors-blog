If you have a thing against ingesting raw fish, you'll never get to savor the delicacy that is sushi.

  

Likewise, if you refuse to eat frog legs, you'll never find out if they really taste like chicken.

  

On a more serious note, investors should avoid holding deeply personal biases against certain industry groups. Doing so can lead you to miss out on what could be some monster profit opportunities.

  

Yes, some industries are traditionally associated with higher growth. Techs and Internets fit the bill. Such stocks do tend to be faster growing and more exciting than industries that make containers or mobile homes.

  

But Internet and techs are not always the groups in play; you should look for setups and strength across all industry groups.

  

In fact, tech highfliers were out of favor for years after the dot-com bubble popped in 2000. Chipmakers tumbled 85% from their March 2000 peak to the October 2002 low; optical gear makers lost 99%.

  

In recent months, chip and chip-equipment makers have returned to the front burner, thanks to demand for mobile smart devices.

  

On the other hand, farm equipment makers, discount retailers and steel makers aren't generally known to be market leaders. In fact, they've all held the pole position in recent years.

  

Changes in technology, demand for supplementary or complementary products and services, regulatory changes, price increases and material shortages can all affect an industry group's performance.

  

Thanks to solid global demand for steel, especially from China, producers of the metal were red-hot from 2003 to 2008.

  

Don't keep your focus too narrow. Opportunities can come from a wide array of industry groups.

  

Use the industry group table to find the best ones and those up-and-comers.

Investors who dismissed the Chemical-Agricultural group as a pile of junk would have missed some of the best stocks in the past decade. As the chart shows, fertilizer makers started huge moves in 2004.

  

**Potash** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) broke out in June of that year and soared more than 1,500% in a little over four years. In August 2006, the group picked up steam again on rising demand for ethanol as an alternative fuel.

  

Another big winner in our study of market leaders, **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)), broke out in the week ended Feb. 16, 2007. The stock climbed 620% in 70 weeks. Fertilizer firms have returned to the spotlight on rocketing grain prices.

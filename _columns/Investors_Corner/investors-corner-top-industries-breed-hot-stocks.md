Investor's Business Daily focuses a large share of its attention on industry groups, their movements and their top stocks.

  

This is because research shows as much as 50% of a winning stock's performance owes to the combined strength of its industry group and broad industry sector.

  

Top industries are breeding grounds for top stocks. And a leading stock breaking out in a higher ranked group has a better chance of a winning run than one starting from a lesser-ranked group.

  

Tracking industries also offers insight as to how institutional investors are allocating their capital. A group moving up in IBD's industry rankings suggests big, smart money investors are establishing or adding to positions in a particular industry.

  

Investors can track such changes using IBD's Industry Sub-Group Rankings table. It appears most days on page B2. You can supplement that information with the Groups With Highest Percent Of Stocks At New Highs and Top 10 Fidelity Industry Funds tables, found on the same page.

  

The rankings also provide perspective on the general market. One example, when defensive industries such as utilities, tobacco and various medical groups press to leading rankings, it implies institutional investors are bracing for market turbulence.

  

You can pinpoint top stocks in high-ranking industry groups by reading IBD's daily Industry Themes column and the weekly Industry Snapshot feature.

  

MarketSmith subscribers own even higher horsepower equipment, able to provide detailed lists of industry groups, their component stocks and fundamental and other information.

  

But any IBD subscriber could have seen that the Computer-Database industry group ranked No. 103 as the market struggled at the beginning of June last year.

  

The group climbed into the leading ranks during a brief, four-week rally in July. An Aug. 3 Industry Themes column pointed out the advance **1**, and noted that **EMC** ([EMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMC)) and **NetApp** ([NTAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTAP)) had played key roles. The article also noted the bigger driver was clustered storage systems provider Isolon. The stock cleared a short-stroke pattern Aug. 2. It soared 80% through November, when EMC announced it would acquire the company.

  

On Aug. 26, IBD's Industry Themes noted the group was seeing additional lift from 3Par, the object of a bidding war between computer titans **Hewlett-Packard** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) and **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) . **2**

  

The same column on Sept. 26 discussed **IBM's** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) acquisition of database group issue Netezza. **3**  Finally Nov. 18, a new Industry Snapshot article provided much broader, deeper perspective on the details behind the group's solid advance. **4**

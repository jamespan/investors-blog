It might be comforting to know a friend or family member is buying the same stock as you, but the real allies you want are not individual investors. You want large funds buying your stock. Funds are the driving force in the market, accounting for the vast majority of trading. These big institutional players, whether they be mutual funds, hedge funds, insurance companies or pension funds, control the destiny of your stock.

  

"It's key to know whether the total number of sponsors is increasing or decreasing," wrote William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "The main thing to look for is the quarterly trend. It's always best to buy stocks showing strong earnings and sales and an increasing number of institutional owners over several recent quarters."

  

Check the most recent quarter and look for a material increase in sponsors from the prior quarter. The bigger the increase, the better. You want leaders that are taking share of their market and of institutional dollars.

  

Run a [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup) and scroll down to the "Supply And Demand" section. There you will find the latest quarterly percentage change in fund sponsorship as well as the number of consecutive quarterly increases.

  

The [up/down volume ratio](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/749961-up-down-volume-ratio-gauges-demand.htm) and [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/752874-how-to-spot-institutional-accumulation.htm) as well as skillful chart analysis are also useful, since fund buying will show up in the marketplace before it gets reported in fund filings.

  

A stock showing steady accumulation in its chart is attracting growing interest among institutional investors.

  

To get a sense for how top mutual funds operate, check the daily feature, Growth Funds Leading the Market (today on Page A6). Each day two funds are highlighted. The top new buys section shows where those funds put the most money to work in the latest reporting period. Remember to always check the chart and run a [CAN SLIM checklist](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735790) on a new investment candidate from any of IBD's features.

  

The table above highlights stocks with a 90 or higher Composite Rating along with a 10% or greater increase in sponsors in the most recent quarter.

  

Cruise ship operator **Norwegian Cruise Line** ([NCLH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NCLH)) added 84 sponsors in the most recent quarter, which continued a streak of eight straight quarters of rising sponsorship. The stock's been in a healthy uptrend since clearing a V-shaped base in late October. It recently broke out past a 55.48 buy point from a second-stage flat base. Shares remain near the entry.

  

Fund sponsorship for [recent IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) **Diplomat Pharmacy** ([DPLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPLO)) jumped to 225 from 177 in the most recent quarter. Diplomat focuses on medication management programs for people with complex chronic diseases. Last-quarter earnings climbed at a triple-digit pace on a 34% jump in revenue. The stock is a bit extended from a recent bounce off its 10-week moving average.

  

**Macom Technology Solutions** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)) is trading near a 39.62 buy point from a cup-shaped base. [In addition to seeing growing sponsorship numbers in recent quarters, Macom](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/060315-755539-macom-technology-solutions-eyes-high-growth-semiconductor-markets.htm) has climbed for six straight weeks, which is another sign of accumulation by funds.

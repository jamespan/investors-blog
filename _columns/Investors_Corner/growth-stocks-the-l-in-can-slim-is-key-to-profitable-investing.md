Investing in industry-leading growth stocks can be a highly profitable endeavor, especially during a [confirmed market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).




When it comes to market uptrends like the one we're in currently, buying stocks and brand names you're familiar with is often not the best way to invest. 


Rather than buying companies with the most recognizable names or biggest market capitalization, investor stand to gain the most from buying companies that are No. 1. At IBD, we call this following [the L in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/): find the leaders, not the laggards, of the stock market.


Being a No. 1 stock means leading that particular industry group (IBD tracks [197 industries](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) each day) or broad market sector (33, in fact, as seen in our [Nasdaq + NYSE stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-nov-07-2019/)). It means the stock has strong earnings and sales growth, leadership in its industry, superior return on equity and exciting new products or services.

Identifying Leading Stocks: Use The RS Rating
---------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IC1cTbl1111319-246x300.jpg)How can individual investors tell if a stock's a leader or a slacker? 


One of the simplest ways to tell is by looking at a stock's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) — [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) for short — by getting a stock quote on Investors.com or seeing its diagnosis at [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). The proprietary [IBD rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) measures the price performance of a given stock against the rest of the market for the past 52 weeks. An [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99 means the stock's outperformed 99% of all other companies over the past 12 months. Action over the past three months gets a heavier weighting.


Long bases, such as a [large cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) or a [gigantic saucer](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/), may give a stock a rating in the 50s to 70s. But if a stock's RS Rating is below, say 50, then it's truly lagging in terms of performance compared with the overall market. That doesn't mean it can't go up in price, it just means that if the stock does go up in price, it'll probably go up less than the rest of the market. 


Keep in mind that the biggest outperforming stocks tend to have RS Ratings of 85 to 90 or above, just before they break out of a [first or second stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


IBD Stock Screens To Find Leading Growth Stocks
-----------------------------------------------


Of course, it's not just a pretty chart that causes a stock to become a buy. The best way to invest in stocks is to first start with sound company fundamentals. As mentioned earlier, the most important fundamentals are strong earnings and sales growth, [the C and A elements in IBD's CAN SLIM model](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/); superior return on equity of 17% or higher; and exciting new products or services. 


Investor's Business Daily has multiple screens to filter through the many stocks out there in the markets to identify potential industry-leading breakouts. The [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/), [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) help identify these kinds of stocks.


Additionally, the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) serves as a great tool for finding stocks that are [building bases](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/), [breaking out of excellent bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) or [clearing alternate entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/). A sort by [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) returns a list of the highest quality stocks that blend strong fundamentals as well as strong price performance.


When you buy a stock, make sure it's coming out of a [sound base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) or relatively mild price consolidation, and only buy it as it surpasses the [breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Ideally, investors are able to buy right as the price reaches its [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and definitely before it leaves [the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). This is to avoid chasing stocks that race up to rapidly.

The stock market is going through its worst days since the Covid-19 outbreak two years ago, and that's left the market strewed with failed breakouts, especially among growth companies.

While we can blame the poor market for that, it doesn't excuse investors from failing to recognize the symptoms of a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) falling apart. Several stock analysis signals can alert investors to sell shares before losses get too big.

Before we discuss the main signals, let's first define what makes a failed breakout. A breakout is any move above the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) from a [proper base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/). The breakout fails when the stock triggers a [sell signal](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/), most commonly [a drop of 7%-8% or more from the buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

## Symptoms Of A Failed Breakout

**1. Volume is too low.** Decades of research into winning stocks show that successful breakouts need a [burst of volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/). This tells you that institutional investors are pushing up the stock, and you need those wealthy funds to take stocks increasingly higher.

Specifically, look for volume to rise at least 40% above the stock's average. This should occur on the day the stock tops the buy point or soon afterward. If daily volume is not so big, look for a jump in the stock's weekly chart.

**2. The base was flawed to begin with.** Don't expect a bad base to produce a good breakout. Watch out for bases that are too short (usually less than seven weeks), [too deep](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/deep-cup-with-handle-can-work-in-bear-market/) (more than 35% or so), [wide and loose](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/heres-why-wide-and-loose-action-can-lead-to-hard-and-fast-losses/), or with multiple [down weeks in big volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/).Â A base that forms mainly below the 50-day moving average is another sign of a weak pattern.

## Stock Analysis Of Late Bases, Fast Moves

**3. The base is late stage.** [First- and second-stage bases historically produce the best stock gains](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). Third-stage bases have a mixed record. Fourth-stage and later bases usually fail.

The normal trajectory of a growth stock is that investor enthusiasm is greatest in the early months or years of its run. As time goes on, fewer investors are betting on the company. Many growth-stock runs last roughly two years, by which time a fourth or fifth base has formed.

**4. Straight up from the bottom to new highs.** If a stock rallies in one or two weeks from the lows of the base to new highs, be suspicious. While this looks bullish, rapid blasts like this often go nowhere.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IC1c030722-279x300.jpg)It's preferable when a base forms its final weeks in a measured advance. If all buyers get in at once, who's left to keep the stock rising?

**5. The stock market is weak.** This may be the No. 1 reason why breakouts fail. Historically, three out of four stocks follow the market lower, so any stock purchase starts with the odds against it. Even perfect breakouts can fail.

## Stock Analysis Of MercadoLibre's Breakout

**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) formed a third-stage base from January to August of last year **(1)**. Its overall decline was 38%, deeper than normal **(2)**. Much of the base formed below the 50-day line **(3)**. In short, the stock had three strikes against it even before it got to its buy point.

On Sept. 2, when the Latin America-based online retailer first closed above the 1,899.33 buy point **(4)**, volume rose 36%, and weekly volume was below average **(5)**. Four weeks after the breakout, MercadoLibre fell below its 10-week line and more than 8% below the entry. The sell signals were just the beginning of its decline.

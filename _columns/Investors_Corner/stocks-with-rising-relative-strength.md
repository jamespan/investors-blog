Tuesday shaped up as a nothing day in the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) â€” at least for most Sector Leaders.

Those stocks below their 50-day moving averages stayed below the line. Those above the line kept their positions over the line.

**CommVault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) provided the sole exception, and it wasn't a dazzling example. The stock closed under its 50-day line for the first time since late October. CommVault lost 1.03 to 72.37, but volume was 26% slower than usual.

The lower volume suggests that CommVault's battle at the 50-day line isn't over.

Other Sector Leaders showed quiet action and offered clues on their condition.

During the recent market weakness, some leaders continue to show rising RS lines. A rising relative strength line means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500.

A bull can't ask for much more than that in a weak market.

The RS line of **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) is the highest it has been in 11 months. A gap-up gain on Feb. 22 jacked up the RS line. Since then, the mobility software provider's stock has traded within the range of the gap-up day.

After a big gap-up, sideways action is acceptable. What bulls don't want to see is a filling of the gap. To see a recent example of a stock filling most of the gap, check the daily chart of **Proto Labs** ([PRLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRLB)), which is not a sector leader.

**HomeAway** ([AWAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AWAY)) also improved its RS line with a gap up. The stock gapped up 13% on Feb. 21 and has held most of the gain. The RS line is the highest in four months.

Fuel card provider **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) also shows a rising RS line. The stock gapped up 11% on Feb. 8. FleetCor has added more gains since. The RS line is at a 52-week high.

The remaining Sector Leaders have declining RS lines.

  How To Profit From 'Cousin' Stocks, The Market's Hidden Stars

Coattails may sometimes move faster than the coats they're attached to. Learn about "cousin stocks," and perhaps you'll find some super-hot coattails to ride.


A cousin stock is one that benefits from the success of another company, a new fad or a new market condition. They can be explosive.


In his best-selling book "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William O'Neil describes a cousin stock from the mid-1960s, when airline travel was really taking off: "Boeing was selling a lot of jets. Every new Boeing jet was outfitted with chemical toilets made by a company called Monogram Industries. With earnings growth of 200%, Monogram stock had a 1,000% advance."


The trick here was identifying a new consumer must-have (air travel) as well as a company that would quickly find soaring demand for its product. Boeing was obvious. Monogram wasn't.


We can find a much more recent example. **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)) is a top chip designer. Processors licensed from the Cambridge, England-based firm dominate the market for mobile devices such as cellphones. With a huge chunk of that market, one gets the sense that ARM may be the best at what it does.


Now let's look at **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), the mother of all iThings. Its iPhones sport a chip designed by ARM Holdings. So iPhone's screaming success proved to be ARM's success as well.


Well, that sounds easy. But here's the twist: You have to find in the cousin stock the very same ideal technical and fundamental traits you'd seek in any candidate for your portfolio.


Earnings growth, sales growth, market dominance, margins, cash flow -- they all should shine. The chart -- well, you know. A tight and lovely base and proper price-volume action are all key. ARM's base in 2010 had it all. It broke out in the week ended Dec. 24 **(1)** -- three months after Apple's breakout to new highs -- and rose 64% in eight weeks **(2)**. And, as usual, you must buy the right stock at the right time in a proper breakout or rebound.

Above all, don't make excuses for a cousin stock that doesn't have the proper metrics. Some cousins can be laggards, too. Always aim for the best-quality goods, whether they're cousins of your best portfolio holdings or not.

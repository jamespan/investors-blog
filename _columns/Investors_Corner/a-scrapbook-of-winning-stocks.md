When IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil discovered chart reading was the road to stock market success, he quickly realized he needed to study many stock charts that had made big gains so he could understand what he was seeing.


Thus were born the model books that O'Neil and his team of portfolio managers have used for decades to study the moves of big winners. He knows history repeats itself in the stock market. The chart of yesterday's winner will reveal itself again in the chart of the stock that is just breaking out.


At the end of each multiyear bull market going back to the 1960s, O'Neil and his staff compiled a new book that provided hours of study for the serious investor. The best investors can spot the base on a current chart and see that it is similar to the base of a past winner. In investing, precedents count.


O'Neil was so thorough in his study, he filled pages with annotations, noting signs of accumulation and distribution, safe points to add shares and points where to sell.


It was through this study that he noticed the same features of winners that appeared repeatedly. That is how he developed the rules that make up CAN SLIM investing today.


He has even tracked winning stocks back to the 1880s. The same patterns that work in today's stock market worked then.


A stock market chart records the history of supply and demand as a stock builds a base, advances and tops. Within it are subtle hints that tell the savvy chart reader whether the stock is under accumulation by big investors or is being sold by the smart money.


You can create your own model book by building a scrapbook of big winners. Make printouts or digital copies of both daily and weekly charts. If you're a Leaderboard subscriber, you can make printouts of Leaderboard stocks as well as any stock in IBD's universe of U.S.-listed names.


If you're a MarketSmith subscriber, you can literally turn the clock back to a particular date and study a chart from a prior period.


You can make printouts of the successful stocks you own, but more importantly, make charts of the winners you missed. Finding them will be easy. They'll be painfully obvious to you because you will be angry at yourself for missing them. But next time, you'll be ready.


IBD last year published its own model book of winning stocks going back to the 1960s. It is available in the [IBD Store](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/model-stock/?src=APA1BQ8) at Investors.com.


Among the stocks in the model book is Reebok, the British sneaker maker that came public on the NYSE in 1985.


It formed a cup-with-handle base in February 1986. From there, it gained 211% in 18 weeks. From the chart, the savvy investor sees rules coming into play that have worked before and will work again.


The stock ran up 20% in the first week, meaning it should be held at least eight weeks **(1)**. The advance was getting overheated  **(2)**, but it was not a climax top because the stock had run less than 18 weeks from the breakout. Finally, it accelerated into real a climax run on a 3-to-1 stock split, and at that point should have been sold **(3)**.

Investing isn't easy, but there are tools that investors can use to simplify the process.

  

MarketSmith can help investors screen and analyze stocks in one place. The product is from a sister company of IBD, and a link to it is found under the Stock Research tab at Investors.com. MarketSmith requires a separate subscription, but it's more powerful than its predecessor Daily Graphs and Custom Screen Wizard, another premium online service. There's no limit to the number of screens you can create in MarketSmith.

  

With MarketSmith, investors can sift through IBD's database to find stock ideas. There are preset screens that filter the database according to criteria from investment gurus such as Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham and IBD's William O'Neil.

  

You can create your own screen using more than 100 fundamental and technical criteria. Investors can choose from categories such as IBD ratings, earnings, sales, industry, and price and volume.

  

When you open a category, graphs for each item are shown with possible values to use.

  

If you want to find stocks with Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength Ratings of, say, 90 or higher, click the SmartSelect Ratings bar. You can enter your minimum and maximum values or drag a pointer across a graph displaying all possible values. In this example, you'll input 90 and 99 for both ratings. To get back to different categories of criteria, click on "Collapse All" at the upper right.

  

To find stocks priced 20 and above that trade at least 400,000 shares on average each day, click on the Price & Volume bar. In the Current Price box, we'll input 20 on the left and say 1,000 on the right. This will give us stocks trading between 20 and 1,000 a share.

  

Then scroll down to the Current 50-Day Average Volume box. On the left box, type in 400 (it's in units of thousands). In the right box, type a large number such as 10 million.

  

Your results are continuously updated each time you change values. To view results, click on one of the three List Panel icons. You can also view the results as a playlist.

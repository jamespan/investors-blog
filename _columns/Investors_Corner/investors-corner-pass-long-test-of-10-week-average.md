Beware the stock that hugs its 10-week moving average.

  

It may be setting up a trap, if shares fall below the line after finding support at that level during their advance.

  

Or it may provide buying opportunities, as was the case for mining giant **BHP Billiton** ([BHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHP)) in 2004.

  

A test of the 10-week line is a favorite entry for many investors. There are two key parts to this strategy: a decline (with quiet volume and no sign of panic) and a bounce (with some solid volume to show that institutional investors are interested in the stock).

  

The highly rated stock sold off 27% from a February peak **1** to 14.61 by May **2**. That marked the bottom of a base.

  

A handle area appeared to form in June **3**. But the handle was too low in relationship to the entire base. Remember, a proper handle must form in the upper half of the base.

  

A handle high enough then developed in July and August **4** as the stock found support at the 50-day and 10-week moving averages, holding above those lines on its chart.

  

The stock cleared the handle but volume was lackluster, barely above average when it should have been at least 40% above average.

  

Investors who bought at that time weren't necessarily in a bad spot. Weekly volume was strong **5**, which was a positive sign.

  

If investors passed on that buying opportunity, another buy area emerged soon afterward.

  

BHP Billiton — still getting support at the 50-day line — formed a handle from late August to a breakout Sept. 21 **6**. The stock rose above the 19.70 buy point in volume that was more than double its average. That left no doubt about the breakout, and shareholders should have spotted the correct buy point.

  

Indeed, the stock followed through on its breakout, rising 12% from the buy point over 12 days.

  

At that point, BHP Billiton started a pullback.

  

The stock retreated to its 10-week line. Volume was higher than ideal, yet Billiton bounced right from the line **7**. That created a follow-on buying range. Another developed in December. Both were successful.

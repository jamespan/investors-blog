In an odd year for the homebuilding trade, most of the big-name builders have reported their quarterly results, and the housing market continues to struggle like a big dog on a leash.


While no homebuilding stocks are currently listed on either the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) or the [Sector Leader](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) lists, a total of five homebuilding names have earned a spot on IBD's [Your Weekly Review](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/your-weekly-review/) list: **K****B Home** ([KBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBH)), **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)), **M.D.C. Holdings** ([MDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDC)) and **Toll Brothers** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)).


Your Weekly Review (see it in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com) casts a slightly broader net for leading stocks, in terms of the vetting process, when compared to the other two lists. The process often turns up gems, but these must be researched with a bit more diligence that the more stringently screened Sector Leaders or IBD 50.


Homebuilders stocks absolutely fit that profile.


The 25 stocks collected in the homebuilding group turned in a collective gain of more than 48%  for the year through Friday. That has earned the stocks a steady top 10 ranking over the past 13 weeks among the [197 industry groups tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-jul-28-2017/).

But the industry is turning in confusing data.


**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) has now posted two quarters of earnings declines (-75% and -4%) despite accelerating revenue growth. **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) reported that earnings growth rebounded in its first and second quarters (from 18% to 29% and 27%), while revenue growth slowed (from 21% to 14% and 12%).


The industry's largest name, **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)), reported that both sales and earnings growth slowed in its fiscal third quarter and its gains in new orders eased to 11.3% in a second-straight quarterly decline.


M.D.C. Holdings reports Tuesday morning. LGI reports next Monday, and Toll Brothers has not yet announced a date for its fiscal Q3 report.


The National Association of Realtors on Monday released stronger-than-expected numbers for pending home sales — houses under signed contracts, a gauge of upcoming sales activity for existing homes — in June. The more critical numbers to homebuilding stocks are sales of new homes.


June new-homes sales inched up 0.8%, but growth was revised lower in March, April and May. Housing starts bounded 8%, building permits jumped 7% — both strong gains, but with the overall numbers remaining far below levels expected from a healthy market.


We should be building total housing starts to 1.2 to 1.4 million, and we are only running at about 1.15 to 1.185 million," said analyst Jade Rahmani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "So there is about a 100,000-to-300,000-unit cushion of potential undersupply."


Why? Competition for limited land and labor is constraining the construction industry's output. At the same time, costs are rising — not just for labor and land, but for materials and services, including Canadian lumber, on which import tariffs of up to 24% were slapped in April, with another round reportedly on the way.


The environment favors big homebuilders, Rahmani says.


"We think the public homebuilders can take market share from privates, because they have better access to capital, and they can just tack onto their existing communities," he said.


Rahmani favors Lennar and D.R. Horton over small- to mid-cap builders. These "have the potential to face margin pressure as a result of increasing land costs and increasing building materials costs and labor inflation," Rahmani said.



But recent gains in market shares have generally taken place below the level of the top 10 largest national builders, says Robert Dietz, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders.


"There has been some growth (in market share) among the top 20 share or the top 100 share," he said. "The top 10 share has been roughly constant at about a quarter of home sales."


Results from small-cap builders M.D.C. and LGI Homes could be telling. Chartwise, M.D.C. remains in play after a brief breakout above a 36.09 buy point in a six-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-is-a-key-chart-pattern/). Shares pulled back [below the buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/winners-often-retest-buy-points-before-rising/), but stopped short of the 7% to 8% level that would trigger the [automatic sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/).


The stock did break below its 50-day moving average in above-average volume. That is a sell signal, but not a hard-and-fast sell rule. That means the stock remains in play. A move back above the 36.09 level in heavy trade would mark a buy opportunity.



Shares of LGI are [extended](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/common-investing-mistakes-chasing-a-good-stock-too-far-up-in-price/) after a third [rebound from 10-week support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-sometimes-buy-twice-or-thrice/) since a breakout from a cup base in January.


The Commerce Department reports July housing starts and building permits data on Aug. 16, and July new home sales numbers on Aug. 23.

**Make Money With IBD Stock Checkup:** [Sixth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/618220/201207251420/make-money-with-ibd-stock-checkup.aspx)

Mutual funds, pension funds and other institutional investors control about three quarters of every dollar in the stock market. Their power can send a stock soaring or plunging into the abyss.

There are a couple ways of tracking where the big money is or isn't going. IBD's proprietary Accumulation-Distribution Rating tracks institutional buying and selling over the past 13 weeks. The rating ranges from a worst-possible E to a best-possible A, with C representing a standoff between buyers and sellers.

Then there's the up-down volume ratio, which is calculated by dividing volume on up days by volume on down days during a 50-day period. A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that institutional investors are net buyers of a stock. Readings below 1.0 indicate net selling.

Of course, calculating the up-down volume ratio for each stock is a daunting task, so IBD does it for you. To see this ratio, put your cursor on the Stock Research tab at Investors.com, then [click on the Stock Checkup tab](http://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx) that appears below it and enter a ticker. Finally, scroll down to the Technical Characteristics section under Supply and Demand.

Up-down volume ratios higher than 1.0 typically occur when a stock is building the right side of a base or breaking out from a base. The best stocks often have ratios of 2.0 or higher as they approach their buy points.

On the other hand, ratios below 1.0 can be a red flag. Such low figures often accompany stocks that are falling into a base or, in some cases, dropping off a cliff.

The up-down volume ratio should be included in your stock analysis, but it's important to note that it's only a secondary indicator. A stock should first show strength in key fundamental categories such as profit and sales growth, return on equity and pretax margins.

Also, the market must be in a confirmed uptrend, since few stocks can stay up for long in a downturn. And make sure the stock has set up in a proper base and hit its buy point in volume that's at least 40% above normal.

The accompanying table lists leading stocks that are setting up in bases and have an up-down volume ratio above 1.0.

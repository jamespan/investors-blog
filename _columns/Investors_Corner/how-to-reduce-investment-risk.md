Four words are never far from the mind of the savvy investor.

Those four words are: "I could be wrong."

Humility works best in investing, especially if the virtue becomes more than an attitude. Humility must become part of the process.

Stubborn investors are so convinced that they are right about a particular stock that they will not only keep a loser but they'll add money to a losing position.

Adding on the decline is a dangerous technique when buying individual stocks. (A few rare value investors have done it successfully, but the punishment for being wrong is too great for the average investor to risk it.)

Humility, rather than stubbornness, is a much better way to invest.

How do you make humility part of the investing process? It begins with the way you buy a stock.

After thoroughly researching a stock and deciding it's worth buying, the investor should open only a half-size position on the breakout.

Humility says that, even with the probabilities in your favor, you can't know whether the breakout will work. That's why you begin with half the money intended for the investment.

If the stock rises 2% to 2.5% from the proper entry point, the investor adds 30% to the position. Only if the stock rises an additional 2% or so does the investor complete the trade by deploying the final 20% of a full-size position.

If the stock fails to advance, then the buying process is halted. If the stock never gets 2% up but rolls over, the 8% loss is only half what it would've been had the investor plunged in.

If the stock fails to advance after the second purchase, you have a choice. You can exit completely or you can give the position more time, provided the 8% sell rule hasn't been triggered.

In some cases, you will complete the three pyramid buys and still see the stock roll over and force you to cut losses with a sale.

That happens. You cannot expect every trade to work.

The advantage to pyramiding into a trade is that if the confirmed uptrend proves weaker than anybody expected, it will not let you complete most breakout trades. This is an important clue when judging the market's strength, though you should always review a failed trade to make sure you are picking top-notch stocks.

If you are disciplined and restrict buys to quality stocks, then you can be confident the problem is probably the market. This means you should consider taking some money to the sidelines.

Finally, remember that the matters discussed here apply to individual stocks, not mutual funds.

The [strategies for investing](http://education.investors.com/) in mutual funds are entirely different than those for handling an individual stock.

"A stock may decline and never come back in price," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil writes in "[How to Make Money in Stocks](https://www.investors.com/offer/splash.aspx?id=htmmis)," which is why losses must be cut early.

However, "a well-selected, diversified domestic growth-stock fund run by an established management organization will, in time, always recover from the steep corrections that naturally occur during bear markets. The reason mutual funds come back is that they are broadly diversified and generally participate in each recovery cycle in the U.S. economy."

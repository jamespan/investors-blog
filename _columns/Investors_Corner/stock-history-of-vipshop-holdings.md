From a chart standpoint, Guangzhou, China-based Vipshop Holdings wasn't much to look at in the five months following its March 2012 [initial public offering](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm). Shares opened below their 6.50 IPO price, then settled in for a long, double-dip consolidation.

  

An online retailer, **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) offered name-brand clothing at steep discounts in limited quantities. This "flash sale" model made customers catch deals while they lasted and keep checking the site for new offerings.

  

Consumers caught on faster than investors did. Vipshop's quarterly sales strode forward in triple-digit jumps.

  

IBD readers learned of the stock in November, when the IPO Aftermarket feature atop the New America page noted its 10% surge. Vipshop had just reported its first profit, defying analyst expectations for a loss, and guided expectations higher.

  

Vipshop had broken out of its first IPO base in September â€” before it was profitable, when it was still under 10 a share. It rose 174% in its first year of trade.

  

IBD's [Industry Themes](http://news.investors.com/investing/ibd-industry-themes.htm) column pointed out that the stock finally started to build a base in late May 2013. At this point, sales were still strong, and Vipshop had three profitable quarters under its belt.

  

IBD's July 16 Big Picture noted that Vipshop had shaped a double-bottom base **(1)**. The feature later added that Vipshop had broken out past 34.09 (before a stock split) in strong trade the following day, July 17.

  

Vipshop was generous in the following months, giving two touchbacks to 10-week support **(2)** so that investors could add to their positions. It climbed 168% in the four months following the July breakout, then took a breather.

  

It crafted a seven-week, third-stage base **(3)**. Its January 2014 breakout past 91.30 led to a 20% gain in four weeks. Investors could have sold and locked in gains. Investors who harbored a big profit cushion could have held as the stock refused to bend below its 10-week moving average.

  

A big upshift came March 4, after Vipshop reported a 150% EPS jump on a 117% sales gain. Shares spiked 27% that week, then eased into another cup base.

  

Vipshop tested support at the 40-week moving average in November, then rebounded to new highs just after a 10-for-1 split, 3,715% above its IPO price.

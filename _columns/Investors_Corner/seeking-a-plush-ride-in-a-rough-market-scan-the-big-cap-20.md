It’s a simple fact of life: Larger conveyances offer smoother rides, be they cars, horses, ships, motorcycles or aircraft.


The same tends to hold true for stocks. Hefty market capitalizations, big floats and deep-pocketed shareholders tend to provide shock absorbers for a stock during tumultuous markets.


This is one of the driving reasons for IBD’s Big Cap 20 list.

The feature appears every Tuesday in IBD and can be found daily under Investors.com’s [Stock Lists](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/) menu.


Stocks on the list must have market capitalizations of at least \$15 billion. They must also pass muster with regard to EPS and [Relative Strength ratings](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), the Sales + Margins + Return On Equity Rating, and other factors related to their chart status and balance sheet.


Most Big Cap 20 names are "low beta" stocks. This means they tend to swing less than the S&P 500 on a day-to-day basis. At the top of the current Big Cap 20 list (see Feb. 23 edition), the IBD Stock Quote for **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) shows a Beta of 0.73. That marks it 27% less volatile than the overall market.


In short, Verizon is not likely to become a hyperactive growth stock. But it still may produce solid gains during periods when the market struggles, and it is less likely to shake shareholders out with volatile action. Take this year, for instance: When the S&P 500 ended Wednesday down 4.6% for the year, Verizon showed a 9.9% gain.


Here's one added perk: Many Big Cap 20 stocks also offer dividends. In Verizon’s case, the current dividend yields an annualized 4.5%.


Not all Big Cap 20 stocks have low betas. No. 2 on the current list, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), shows a beta of 1.19. It's definitely more volatile.


But further down the list you’ll find **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)) with a beta of 0.67, **Tyson Foods** ([TSN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSN)) with a 0.66 beta and **WEC Energy Group** ([WEC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEC)) with a beta of 0.56. These three big-cap stocks are up 8%, 23% and 10%, respectively, and offer dividend yields of 5.1%, 0.9% and 3.1% this year.


And that’s just a quick scan through the first eight stocks on the list.


Remember, you don’t just jump into any stock on the list. As with any leading stock, big-cap leaders must be passing valid buy points in strong volume, and the market must be in an uptrend. Be more cautious if you see IBD's [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) noting that the uptrend is under pressure.

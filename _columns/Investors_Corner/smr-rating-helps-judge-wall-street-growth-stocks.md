  Why The SMR Rating Judges A Stock In Right Context

Some things are best judged if they aren't regarded in isolation.


A film advertisement, for instance, once boldly trumpeted, "An endearing romantic comedy" across a page, and attributed the seeming high praise to a movie review in a newspaper.


The review actually read, "political propaganda wrapped into an endearing romantic comedy that starts losing its laughs," but that was conveniently left out of the ad.


Investing data can also be misleading, if you are viewing only out-of-context facts.


If a company reports a jump in revenue growth, an experienced investor will ask two questions: Is the company slashing prices to step up sales growth? Did the company make an acquisition that's boosting sales?


Sales growth from an acquisition can be positive, especially if the acquisition is adding a higher-margin business.


But sales growth driven by lower prices suggests the company's products are seeing weaker demand or that the products are being commoditized.


Many products start out being high-margin items. But as more competitors emerge, they become lower-margin products. You want to catch a stock on the right end of that trend.


So, when an investor notices an increase in sales, the first thing to check is IBD's SMR Rating, which stands for sales, margins and return on equity.


IBD combines those three elements into one rating because they are interrelated. You can find the ratings in the stock tables in the B section. The rating is also listed at Investors.com in the stock quotes area and in Stock Checkup, and on the MarketSmith charts.


The SMR rating's scale runs from A to E, with A being the best.


Generally, you should avoid buying stocks with an SMR rating of D or E.


Sometimes a turnaround candidate will have a C rating, but most top-rated stocks carry an A or B.


The gauge is useful because sales growth built on low margins will hurt the SMR Rating. Return on equity is relevant because it measures how efficiently a company is using its net assets to make a profit.


After the Dec. 20 follow-through day confirmed an uptrend was under way, the market remained in the uptrend for 67 sessions.


In the first month after the follow-through, a number of quality stocks cleared buy points. Some of those entries were triggered by breakouts from bases and others from three-weeks-tight patterns. One was a short-stroke pattern.


See the accompanying table that lists gains after clearing the buy point and the stock's SMR rating at the time of the breakout.

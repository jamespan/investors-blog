  Should You Sell When A Stock Undercuts Its 10-Day Line? Sometimes, Yes

Since mutual funds and other institutional investors drive the majority of a stock's price action, tracking the big money's moves makes sense.


That's why the 50-day moving average is a key gauge of a stock's health for most individual investors to watch. If a stock pulls back to and rebounds off the 50-day line (drawn in red on **[daily charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY)** at Investors.com), the big money is likely stepping in to buy shares. But if a stock crashes below the support level, mutual funds are probably selling.


Likewise, the 10-day moving average can be a useful short-term metric for traders. If a stock falls below the 10-day line, for instance, some investors may decide to exit a position to lock in gains over a shorter holding period -- especially when the gain from a proper breakout has reached 10% or more.


Sometimes, a stock may break the 10-day line intraday but quickly recover. While that could be an early signal the uptrend is in trouble, jumping the gun too fast can shake a trader out of a stock prematurely. One way to avoid this potential scenario is by waiting until the end of the day to decide whether to hold or sell. If the stock still looks weak late in the session, trading firmly below the 10-day moving average and near intraday lows, a short-term investor can decide it's time to sell.


![IC-IBP-081516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IC-IBP-081516-1024x545.jpg)Pay attention to volume too. A heavy-volume breach of a support line usually triggers a sell rule.


Take **Installed Building Products** ([IBP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBP)), for example. Shares of the insulation and roofing products installer ran up 38% from a May 5 breakout past a 28.28 handle buy point. On June 13, the stock closed below its 10-day moving average for the first time since the breakout **(1)**. Volume was heavy, though the break below wasn't too steep.


It would've been perfectly acceptable to take some profits here, since the gain was 22% from the breakout, in profit-taking range. Over the next two weeks, the stock continued to weave above and below the 10-day line -- mostly below. Installed Building then resumed its uptrend by making new highs in July.


On July 25, shares closed decisively below the 10-day line again, this time in weak volume **(2)**. The stock edged lower the next two sessions, also in tepid trade. But investors who still held a position would have been best off getting out amid the continued struggle with the 10-day line.


Installed Building then fell 4% in big volume on Aug. 4, slicing cleanly through its 50-day moving average and triggering a traditional key sell signal. The next session, on Aug. 5, it reported Q2 results that showed robust growth, but its earnings of 34 cents a share missed the consensus view by 8%. The stock triggered a key sell signal by suffering its biggest single-day point drop **(3)** in heavy volume since the May breakout.

Institutional buying and selling determines whether you win or lose in the stock market. To win consistently, you'll need more than a few small-time buyers on your side. Consider what William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "It takes big demand to push up prices, and by far the biggest source of demand for stocks is institutional investors. These large investors account for the lion's share of each day's market activity."

  

Institutions are professionally managed large pools of money such as mutual funds, banks, pension funds, insurance firms and hedge funds. Institutions often take weeks or months to build their positions in a stock. That kind of steady buying is the upward propulsion and support you want behind your stocks.

  

The growth investor's job is to find leading fundamental companies that are under heavy institutional accumulation, and then to pinpoint precise buy points.

  

[Institutional accumulation](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735744&sourceid=735749) can be spotted on daily and weekly [charts](https://www.investors.com/) home page or every day in the B-section of the paper for highly-rated stocks that are experiencing a big spike in trading volume, which is almost always institutional activity.

  

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a quick way to gauge recent institutional buying and selling. The rating runs on an A to E scale and measures price and volume activity over the past 13 weeks. An A represents heavy institutional buying, while an E represents heavy selling. Prefer stocks that break out with an A or B rating.

  

The up/down volume ratio is another useful gauge to use in conjunction with the Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Both can be found by running a [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup). The ratio simply takes the total volume on up days over the past 50 sessions and divides it by total volume on down days. Ratios above 1.0 indicate positive net demand.

  

The table above highlights some stocks showing exceptional accumulation in the current market, measured by an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A and an up/down volume ratio of 1.4 or higher as of Thursday's close.

  

Chipmaker **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) and cloud software firm **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) have recently broken out of fresh bases.

  

Shoemaker **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) is holding near highs after a huge run-up from a breakout past 63.08. Shares cleared the entry Feb. 12 in volume 281% above average. Meanwhile, French advertising firm **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) on Thursday surpassed a 46.60 buy point in a first-stage long and deep cup pattern.

Investment advisors typically tell clients to keep a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, commodities and other assets as a way of reducing risk.


While it's true that diversification reduces an investor's exposure to any one stock or asset, such conventional wisdom can have serious drawbacks.


First, how much diversification is enough? Should your portfolio have 20 securities or 200 or more? What types of commodities, bonds or stocks should you buy? The possibilities are almost infinite.


Building a big portfolio is OK for a mutual fund with lots of money and an army of staff to research, select and keep up with a wide range of assets. But it's very difficult -- if not impossible -- for individual investors to manage such a large number of securities.


"The more stocks you own, the harder it is to keep track of all of them," IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."  "Broad diversification is plainly and simply often a hedge for ignorance," he added.


Furthermore, diversification is unlikely to save you in a bear market. As the 2008 crash showed, nearly everything -- stocks, commodities, real estate -- went down. Some assets take years if not decades to recover. How about emerging market stocks and gold futures? They remain well off peaks reached in 2007 and 2011, respectively.


IBD research shows that it's actually less risky and more rewarding to own just a few carefully chosen stocks that meet IBD's CAN SLIM requirements -- and to monitor these investments on a regular basis to spot key moments of strength and weakness. If you grab a stock that rises 200% but you have 29 other stocks of equal proportion in your portfolio, the wealth boost is minimal.


So focus your time and money on the biggest winners.


These stocks should come from top industry groups, boast the fastest earnings and sales growth rates, produce cutting-edge products or services, and have wide profit margins and strong management.


Support from leading mutual funds and other institutional investors is also critical.


"The best results are achieved through concentration, by putting your eggs in a few baskets that you know well and watching them very carefully," O'Neil wrote.


People with \$20,000 to \$200,000 to invest should buy only four or five stocks. Those with \$5,000 to \$20,000 should buy at most three stocks, and those with about \$3,000 should limit their holdings to two stocks, O'Neil says.


The idea is that investors should be able to limit losses and maximize gains by keeping tabs on just a few stocks. In a market correction, it's important to follow IBD's strict sell rules and raise cash by selling to protect profits before a gain turns into a loss. In the worst case, sell any stock that falls 8% below its buy point, since you don't know when -- or if -- the stock will recover.


For example, those who bought gold in 2011 or the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ([EEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEM)) ETF in 2007 seeking diversification are still sitting on losses.


The Market Pulse box that accompanies the [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) each day identifies whether the market is in a correction or in an uptrend, which helps you to make buy and sell decisions. Also, the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) feature at investors.com is a good place to research a stock's fundamentals, including how it stacks up against its industry group peers.


Keep in mind that you must continue to watch each stock you've purchased for changes in its fundamentals and in its chart so that you don't miss any buy or sell signals. That's a difficult task with a big portfolio.

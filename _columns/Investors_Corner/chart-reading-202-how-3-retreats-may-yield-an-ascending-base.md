It's good to see even top growth stocks pull back after a long, healthy run. After all, that gives it a chance to catch its breath and set the stage for what could be the next leg up.

When you see a stock make its third pullback, dig a little deeper; the setup could be more than just an ordinary pullback. The stock may be shaping an ascending base.

Unlike cups, [cup with handles](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [double bottoms](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) and [flat bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), all of which are quite common, ascending bases are rare. But they can be powerful patterns.

In 1999, Internet service provider America Online cleared an ascending base and nearly doubled in about five weeks. Titanium Metals bolted out from a 15-week ascending base in 2006, then doubled in about seven weeks.

An ascending base usually forms after a stock has already broken out from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) or [double-bottom pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). So there should be a prior uptrend of at least 20%.

## Market Conditions For This Rare Chart Pattern

One can characterize the ascending base as a pattern of a strong stock in a not-so-strong market. Each time the stock tries to rally, the weight of the overall market holds it back. Once the resistance from the general market disappears, the stock is free to make its advance — kind of like removing a brick off a heavy metal spring.

The key distinguishing feature in an ascending base formation is its three pullbacks. Each one has a higher high and higher low, which gives it the overall ascending appearance. This element is also key: Each retreat should be due to general market weakness. And each pullback should be 10% to 20% in depth. Some pullbacks may take the stock to its 10-week or 50-day moving average.

[MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com) has programmed its pattern recognition algorithm to identify ascending bases that show corrections of as little as 6% and as much as 25%.

## How To Spot The Ascending Base In Growth Stocks

A proper pattern usually develops over nine to 16 weeks. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the third pullback. Volume should be at least 40% above normal on breakout day.

Retailer Limited Brands, which later came known to be L Brands and then **Bath & Body Works** ([BBWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBWI)), cleared a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in the week ended Feb. 26, 1982 **(1)**. The stock gained 43% by late July before retreating to its 10-week moving average **(2)**. It came out of that pullback and shot up for 10 straight weeks. After that rampage, the stock fell 13% **(3)** — the first of what would be three pullbacks of an ascending base.

A second retreat came in January 1983. The stock fell 17% before finding support near its 10-week line **(4)**. Limited's third pullback came in March. That set up an ascending base with a 15.29 buy point **(5)**, which is adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split later in the year.

The stock cleared that base in the week ended March 25, 1983. Limited more than doubled by July before settling into another base **(6)**.

Fast-forward to L Brands' action recently, and on July 29 the stock bolted out of a deep [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). LB moved well past a 25.36 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in monster volume of 39 million shares, nearly five times its 50-day moving average.

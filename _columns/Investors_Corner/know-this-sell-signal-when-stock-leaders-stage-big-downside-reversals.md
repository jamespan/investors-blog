Do you want to sharpen your decision making regarding when to sell stocks? Always pay attention to what's happening on a chart.


This is one of the cores in IBD's philosophy: The [daily and weekly charts](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) can truly be your best friends in the stock market. Why? They give you facts, not the opinion of just one investor or two.




To use charts correctly, you don't have to sit there and watch every tick. You can view a [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) after the session's close to determine if any red flags have been raised. The weekly chart also provides incredible insight on the balance of supply vs. demand.


One big red flag to help time your exit: Watch out for downside price reversals that close near or at their session lows, especially when volume soars well above normal levels.

CLOSE




A downside or negative reversal takes place when a stock runs up sharply intraday, then changes course and ends down in price or flat for the day.


When To Sell Growth Stocks: Why This Is A Bearish Signal
--------------------------------------------------------


While reversals can take place on a daily chart, they can appear on weekly and monthly charts. Reversals occur in individual stocks, as well as in market indexes like the Nasdaq and S&P 500.



Not all downside reversals are a cause for concern.


A high-priced stock that turns tail and ends a point lower in average volume isn't necessarily worrisome. But after an intraday boom to bust takes place and a stock doesn't resume its rally, keep close watch. It may mean that institutional investors are not enthusiastically coming in to grab shares.


A negative reversal and close near the day's price low is especially bad if it follows a long, sharp run.


Many times, turnover will be sharply above its average level over the past 50 trading sessions. (All IBD [daily charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) feature a red line running across the volume bars to signify the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/). On a weekly chart, the red line represents the 10-week moving average in volume.)


Sometimes the reversal marks a failing breakout from a [late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). In such a case, [sell fast to cut losses](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) or take profits.


A big downside reversal can coincide with a [climax run](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-rules-using-climax-top-convert-paper-gains-real-profits/), which is another key sell signal. Another name for it is the climax top. Bad reversals may also involve the heaviest daily volume since the start of the stock's big move, [the largest one-day point loss](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-signal-biggest-1-day-point-loss-can-mark-the-top/), or the widest daily or weekly price spread ever.


A Sell Signal In Highflying Solar Stocks In 2007
------------------------------------------------


Solar stocks were red hot in 2007. **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) recovered from a third pullback to the 50-day moving average following a breakout in December 2006. In September 2007, the stock ramped to new highs.


![ic_spwr_102416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IC_spwr_102416-1024x548.png)


On Nov. 8, SunPower surged 13% intraday, hitting an all-time high of 164.49. At its best levels that day, the stock was up more than 100% since the start of its rebound two months ago. SunPower then showed a big change of heart; it ended 2% lower in huge volume **(1)**.


The price spread from high to low was nearly 20%.


SunPower fell 68% by March 2008 and kept sliding. For years, it traded in single digits before rebounding.



In the biotech patch, **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) posted a sharp reversal on Aug. 4, 2015.


Even though the stock rose 4.8% that day in big volume and hit a new high of 605.93, Regeneron closed the day in the lower half of the intraday trading range.


The stock cooled off, formed a two-month [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), then broke out on Oct. 27 past a 557.97 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). However, just a week later, the biotech staged another unsavory price reversal.


On Nov. 4, Regeneron rose as high as 588 but closed down more than 2% at 564. Volume jumped sharply. The rally quickly unraveled. It now trades near 284, more than 52% below its all-time peak back in 2015.


When To Sell Stocks: How Gold Stocks Peaked In 2016
---------------------------------------------------



**Barrick Gold** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), which completed its merger with Randgold on Jan. 2, 2019, presented an "island top" formation as it peaked on July 6, 2016.


That day, the stock rallied more than 2% in volume that more than doubled to 2.3 million shares; that was also one of its heaviest sessions since Jan. 1. However, Randgold finished in the lower half of its intraday range after creating a price gap in which the day's low of 124.28 exceeded the prior day's high of 122.98.

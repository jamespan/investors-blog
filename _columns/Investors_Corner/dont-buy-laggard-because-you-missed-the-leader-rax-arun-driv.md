**Top 10 Investing Myths:** [Seventh In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/604007/201203141812/top-10-investing-myths.aspx )


I know what some of you are thinking. The market is bolting ahead and you're ticked off because you missed some big winners.


And now, having missed the proper buy points for those stocks, you're tempted to buy some second-best names â€” or worse.


Feeling sorry you didn't buy cloud computing company **Rackspace Hosting** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)) at its 45.55 flat-base buy point on Feb. 2 **1**? Of course, who wouldn't be?


The stock's network solutions group ranks on top of the 197 industries tracked by IBD, as of Friday. Rackspace has already climbed 30%, while its up-down volume ratio indicates that big buyers are still chasing after the stock.


Well, you don't want to pay up more than 5% from the buy point, so you missed Rackspace.


But you notice other names in the group that seem more, well, buyable.


They haven't yet taken off. Their P-E ratios are lower, less scary. You feel like you're getting a nice deal by buying a small house in the suburbs instead of that overpriced apartment on Park Avenue South.


Don't do it.


You aren't convinced yet? You still think **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) is a better deal for the money than Rackspace?


Aruba is trading below its 10-week moving average. (Rackspace stands 11% above that line.) Aruba's P-E ratio is a manageable 35. Rackspace: 104!


And, while Rackspace is pushing into new highs, Aruba is sitting 33% below its 52-week high.


Aruba's 91 EPS Rating is almost as good as Rackspace's (99). Its 23 RS rating is poor, but after all that's what a bargain looks like, right?


Or **Digital River** ([DRIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRIV)). Now there's a bargain! EPS Rating of 59, Relative Strength Rating of 12. One supposes it all depends on how damaged you like your goods.


Aruba and Digital River are both former leaders that have fallen on hard times.


Research shows that when a leader is done leading, it will fall, on average, 72% from its peak.


Does that sound unlikely? Aruba has already fallen as much as 55%, Digital River 78%.


Yes, you missed Rackspace, which is on its way up. Don't compound your grief by buying something that's on its way down.

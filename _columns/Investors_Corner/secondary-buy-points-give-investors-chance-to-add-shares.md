  Adopt A Sound Strategy For Secondary Buy Points

When your first purchase of shares in a stock is making money, it's natural to want to add more.


So when a secondary buy point arrives, what's the best strategy?


Should you be aggressive and buy as many shares as you did the first time? Or should you pick up a smaller amount? And how small should "small" be?


First, let's define a "secondary buy point."


The three-weeks-tight pattern, short stroke and the first two bounces off the 10-week moving average in robust trade following a good breakout offer such follow-on buying chances.


Stocks usually form these patterns soon after they've already broken out of solid base patterns.


In general, add a small amount of shares — no more than 20% of your full-size position. It can be much smaller than that, too.


For instance, say you've got a \$100,000 position in a winning stock, and it's now moving past a three-weeks-tight entry point in solid turnover. You could add \$5,000 worth of shares, and it's a smart move. Why?


Two reasons: You're feeding more cash into a winner, not a loser; and you're preventing the average cost of the position from rising too quickly.


**Easy Does It**


An adventurous investor might even be tempted to establish a new full-size position at a secondary buy point, but such a strategy isn't recommended because the risk is higher.


It's ultimately up to the investor. The following guidelines can help in the decision-making process.


First, how is the overall market acting? Does the Market Pulse (today on A1 of the print edition and eIBD) show that it's in a confirmed uptrend?


Second, how is the stock acting, and how strong is your conviction that it will continue to go higher?


Third, how far is the secondary buy point above the primary buy point? You want to avoid buying too high in price, or you might face a loss in the total position if the stock suddenly begins to correct sharply in price.


Finally, remember your sell rules. If the stock falls 8% from the secondary buy point, sell that portion of your stake.


Focus on the best stocks — like those in the IBD 50 — that had a strong uptrend prior to forming a secondary buy point. They have a greater chance of success.


Consider drugmaker **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) . It's 6% past a three-weeks-tight buy point of 75.21 after clearing the pattern Feb. 15 in big volume. A three-weeks-tight pattern consists of three straight weeks in which a stock moves 1% or less from the previous week.


For those who bought Celgene at the Sept. 20 breakout from a buy point at 62.59, the gain has reached 20%. At this point, a Celgene shareholder has to make a decision about whether to take some profits or buy additional shares.


New tech IPO **InvenSense** ([INVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVN)) offered a follow-on buying opportunity on March 7, when it jumped 10% off its 10-week line in huge volume. The stock had soared 62% above an 11.95 buy point from its IPO base in just over two months before pulling back to its key support line.


But its second trip to the 10-week line in March revealed serious risks of adding to one's stake.


One, the market's uptrend was under pressure since March 28. InvenSense fell in heavy trade, and the action was wild. This should give you pause when deciding whether or not to add shares.

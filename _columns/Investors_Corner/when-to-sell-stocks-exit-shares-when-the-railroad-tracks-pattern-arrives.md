Every determined growth stock investor wishes to pinpoint when to sell stocks and make a brilliant exit at or near the top. To do so, emotional control is vital. Heard the saying, "Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered" before? It means a whole lot today as it did scores ago.




To consistently sell your big profit generators at or near the end of their strong runs, use charts. Master the price-and-volume patterns that point to a major turning point in the stock. You want to be ready to sell when the market shifts from one of furious greed and soaring demand to one of stark fear and ballooning supply.


The "railroad tracks" pattern relays such a [psychological shift](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/).


When To Sell Stocks: Basics Of The Railroad Tracks
--------------------------------------------------


Bill O'Neil, [who founded Investor's Business Daily in 1984](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), named the pattern after a deep dive into the greatest stock market winners in history. He led the construction of a massive database that analyzed how each great one peaked in price.



In the railroad tracks, look for a stock, following a significant rally, to post two straight weeks in which it makes a big weekly price swing. And in that second week, eye a puny weekly gain in price. "I call this 'railroad tracks' because on a weekly chart, you'll see two parallel vertical lines," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "This is a sign of continued heavy volume distribution without real additional price progress for the week."


Why does the stock fail to stage further upside price progress? Savvy fund managers sell heavily into the rally.


Each price bar in [IBD weekly charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) delineates the weekly high, low and close. When the weekly price change is minimal, the hash marks on the weekly price bars line up in such a way that they resemble railroad ties.


As one example in "How To Make Money In Stocks," O'Neil illustrates how former big growth stock Human Genome Sciences formed railroad tracks in March 2000. During the second week of the pattern, HGSI essentially "retraces the move of the first" week.


How Chesapeake Stock Topped
---------------------------


**Chesapeake Energy** ([CHK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHK)) produced a great example in June 2008.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wIC_chk121718-300x169.jpg)The oil and gas explorer broke out of a 13-week shallow [cuplike base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 41.29 [ideal buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Feb. 11-12, 2008. Buying pressure built up fast. Volume soared above average for six days in a row. It gushed up 49% in just four months. Along the way, Chesapeake bounced firmly off the 10-week moving average at prices higher than the 41.29 [breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) **(1)**, [providing fresh entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


But in the weeks ended June 20 and 27, Chesapeake formed shiny railroad tracks **(2)**. Shares swung 13.9% from the low to high the first week, 11.4% in the second. Chesapeake edged just 0.2% higher in that second week. Volume bulged again **(3)**.


The next week, Chesapeake hit new highs but reversed, closing the week in the lower half its price range. By Oct. 3, shares dropped to 28.92, 61% off the peak of 74. By December, the stock drilled below 10.

Many sports fans know all about negative reversals.

Your team starts off the season with a bang, climbing to the top spot in its division. Then it suffers a few bad losses. Then some more. By season's end, your team wallows near the bottom of its division.

Now that's a negative reversal. You also could call it a downside reversal.

In investing, a negative reversal refers to a stock jumping up and marking new highs, then quickly retreating to close near the low of its trading range and lower for the day or week.

Or it closes up just a bit. You can have daily or weekly downside reversals.

If you notice an unusually wild reversal — or a couple in quick succession — in high volume after a big advance, that's often a sell signal. Such action occurs as savvy institutions unload their big positions just as investor optimism is riding sky-high.

By at least selling part of your position, you're locking in your gains close to the top of a leader's advance. Don't expect to sell right at the top.

**Yahoo**'s ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) action in 1998 and 1999 is a case in point.

The Internet search engine's big negative reversal in strong turnover came in the week ended Jan. 15, 1999 **1**. That signaled it was time to lock in your profit if you had bought Yahoo as it cleared bases and sprinted to new highs in either July 1997, February 1998 **2** or June 1998 **3**.

The January 1999 reversal wasn't Yahoo's first such move. The stock also staged a weekly reversal to the downside in strong volume in early July 1998 **4**, then did it again two weeks later **5**.

Wild reversals at the peak have served as a sell signal for many market leaders. Just look at **Charles Schwab**'s ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) action in April 1999, or **Taser**'s ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) behavior in April 2004 after its stunning run.

In terms of sell strategies, this is a common-sense rule and an offensive approach.

You're often selling into strength, meaning as the stock is advancing. Everything probably looks great at this point in terms of fundamentals and IBD ratings.

It can be tough to bail out on the way up, but there's nothing wrong with locking in a 40% or 50% profit. It certainly beats seeing it dwindle into a much smaller gain.

In addition, take note that this is a sell rule that requires chart-reading skills. You can't spot multiple negative reversals in high volume if you don't get stock charts.

This relates back to one of IBD's main strategies: Buy stocks mostly on fundamentals and partly on technicals (meaning chart reading), but sell mostly on technicals.

As you work on spotting negative reversals, you ought to study charts of not just individual stocks, but also charts of the major indexes.

After all, reversals by indexes can help signal when the overall market is turning from bullish to bearish.

William O'Neil wrote about reversals as a warning sign in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

A top reversal is when the market closes at the bottom of its trading range after making a new high that day.

"Top reversals are usually late signals — the last straw before a cave-in," IBD's founder and chairman wrote. "Use of individual stock selling rules ... should already have led you to sell one or two of your holdings on the way up, just before the market peak."

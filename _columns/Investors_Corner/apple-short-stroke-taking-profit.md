A short stroke is a secondary buy point that allows an investor to add shares safely.

  

It's a fairly rare formation, spotted only on a weekly chart. So don't be surprised if numerous short-stroke patterns fall flat. It takes only two weeks to build, so the short stroke is virtually impossible to see on a daily chart.

  

How does it work?

  

In the first week, the stock makes a big surge. The price gain can be as much as 50% or more, but it doesn't have to be that much. In the second week, the stock trades extremely tightly. The second week's high shouldn't be higher than the first week's.

  

The point of a short stroke is that even after a big week in which you might expect sellers to appear and take profits, they don't. Demand is overwhelmingly strong. In fact, the stock may be poised to keep rising fast.

  

Though typically a secondary buy point, like a three-weeks-tight pattern or a bounce off the 50-day moving average, sometimes a short stroke can be a place to take an initial position, provided the investor has great conviction in the stock, the market is in a strong uptrend and the company's fundamentals are rock solid.

  

Such was the case of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in November 2005.

  

Apple was still riding its success with the iPod, introduced in 2001, with the iPhone and the iPad yet to come. Its five-year annualized EPS growth rate was 153%. The last quarter's earnings were up 171% and up 311% the quarter before that. IBD ranked Apple's industry group, Computers-Manufacturers, No. 7 out of 197 groups.

  

Numbers like that cannot be ignored. Even though 2005 was a relatively flat year, the market was in a tradeable rally at the time, and Apple was a good candidate to take an initial position after a short stroke.

  

In the week ended Nov. 4, 2005, Apple gained more than 12% in above-average volume **(1)**. It was already well extended from a base it broke out of in August.

  

It finished the week near the top of its weekly range. The next week, Apple finished up less than 1%. It did not go above the 62.32 high of the previous big up week. Apple traded in that second week between 62.11 and 59.01, a move from high to low of just 5.3%.

  

The buy point was 10 cents above the high of the first week, or 62.42. Apple ran up 38% in nine weeks before topping. Apple would have been a good candidate to lock in a 25% profit.

**How To Spot A Fine Chart:** [Last In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/609681/201204301707/how-to-spot-a-fine-chart.aspx)

  

If there's anything you can count on in investing, it's that things don't always go smoothly.

  

A stock will not always carve out a quiet, controlled uptrend. But some turbulence isn't all that bad, either. A shakeout can serve stocks well. It is generally a sharp sell-off that causes scared investors to dump their positions.

  

This could involve a wild one-day swing caused by an analyst downgrade, company-specific news or economic reports. Sometimes a shakeout occurs in the absence of news. Regardless of the reason, a high-quality stock will snap right back.

  

On Dec. 6, auctioneer **Liquidity Services** ([LQDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LQDT)) slumped as much as 16% on earnings news, but it bounced back and gained 6%. It also cleared a base that day.

  

A shakeout can come in several varieties. A stock could be forming a handle, where there is a day of wild action in heavy turnover. But as long as quiet, constructive action returns, one day of bad action isn't detrimental.

  

Other times, a shakeout involves a more prolonged downturn and subsequent comeback that takes place over several days or weeks.

  

Tests of the 50-day moving average (or 10-week line on a weekly chart) can also be shakeouts. If the stock falls to the line or breaches it, but then snaps right back, that could become a buy setup, especially if it's accompanied by big volume.

  

The second low in a double-bottom base is all about the shakeout. That's why it should undercut the first low.

  

Psychologically, shakeouts can be hard to deal with. The stock just caused an investor to face a loss or see paper gains vanish.

  

It's human nature to want to back away and not go through the same pain. But at the same time, a shakeout can represent a buying opportunity.

  

On Oct. 5, 2005, **Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) tumbled as much as 11% intraday, breaching its September low of 30.26 and thus creating what would eventually become a double-bottom base **(1)**.

  

The stock cut its loss to 2% that day and broke out of the base seven days later **(2)**. After a handle formed, a second breakout on Nov. 1 offered a second entry **(3)**.

With the market in an uptrend, investors should once again look to get back into individual stocks. But don't just buy any old name and hope for the best.

  

If you want strong returns, you need to be choosy.

  

First, focus on the best stocks in top-performing sectors. You want the ones with market-dominating products and services that are posting the big increases in earnings and sales.

  

On the chart side, choose stocks that have pulled back mildly during a market correction. In some cases, the decline may be even less than that of the major indexes. Growth stocks are usually more volatile than the market averages. When they take relatively mild losses, this means they are getting support from institutional investors.

  

On a related note, zero in on stocks that are closer to their 52-week highs than the market. These are showing outperformance and their Relative Strength lines will likely be in new-high ground before the share price.

  

Don't totally dismiss V-shaped patterns. While U-shaped formations are preferred, current V-shaped ones may be just a function of the market. From late July to early August, the major averages sold off sharply before stabilizing.

  

**AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) and **Hansen Natural** ([HANS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HANS)) broke out of V-shaped patterns recently.

  

Volume on breakout day should be at least 40% above average. You won't know this until after the close, but you can estimate it. Check Stocks On The Move at Investors.com and see if your stock made it to the screen. If so, look at the volume percent change column to see the projected volume change for the day.

  

Or just look at the stock's raw volume figure and compare it to the daily average. If a stock that usually trades a million shares a day has already traded 500,000 shares an hour into the session, you know it's likely going to be a busy day.

  

Fast-growing Ugg boots maker **Deckers Outdoor**  ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) cleared a high handle Sept. 12, 2006 **1**. Volume exploded 169% above average that day, leaving no doubt that a breakout occurred **2**. Deckers surged 34% by late December before settling into a new base.

  

Sometimes big volume may not show up until a day or two after the breakout. Investors can also check for heavy volume on the stock's weekly chart.

When it comes to mastering the art of how to trade stocks, are you tired of hearing others say how they timed a buy perfectly when a stock with strong fundamentals broke out in heavy volume? Starting to think there might be something to technical analysis?




Good for you. You're on the right track because success in the market is about combining fundamental and technical analysis.


Technical analysis is nothing more than gauging supply and demand in a stock — studying price and volume trends to tell you if a stock has a better chance of going up or down due to persistent signs of institutional buying or selling.


Here's a tip: If you're just starting out, keep it simple.



Analyzing price and volume trends can tell you when big investors are accumulating (buying) a stock or when a stock is under distribution. That's why [IBD charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) aren't cluttered with a lot of confusing data. Price and volume bars, a couple of key moving averages and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), which compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500, are all you need.


How To Trade Stocks: Don't Get Overwhelmed
------------------------------------------


It's easy to get caught up in oscillators, Bollinger Bands and a myriad of trend lines as well as terms like crossover, convergence and divergence. But in the end, too much information can be a bad thing, especially when you're first starting out. Technical analysis can get very complicated very quickly, which is why most have an aversion to it in the first place.


Oscillators are widely used in technical analysis, but they're not all that helpful when a market trend is clearly discernible. During market uptrends, for example, an oscillator can flash an overbought signal, causing investors to take profits in a big winner too early. Conversely, an oversold reading during a market downtrend could get an unwitting investor into a stock too early, just before another leg down.


Once you've gotten good at recognizing institutional buying and selling in a stock and when a stock is ready to break out or break down, keep learning. Read past columns in [IBD University](http://education.investors.com/) on how to time your market entry and exit. Understand the concepts of [follow-through days](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/652274-ibd-big-picture-column-and-market-pulse.htm?Ntt=victor-reklaitis-investors-corner-market-pulse) and [distribution.](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/658035-institutional-selling-flags-stock-market-tops.htm?Ntt=ken-shreve-distribution-day-investors-corner)


Don't Get Misled By This Technical Trading Tool
-----------------------------------------------


One popular oscillator is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). It's a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of a stock's price. A stock is called "overbought" when the RSI moves above 70 and "oversold" when it goes below 30.


**Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) flashed an overbought reading of 83 when it started carving a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) in late May 1. It moved sideways for six weeks, staying in overbought territory, but perfectly acceptable price action after a nice uptrend.


The stock [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and soared 22% in the week ended July 12, clearing a 63.45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares remain under accumulation. The stock continues to trade tightly and hold on to the majority of its gains — even though the RSI oscillator still says it's "overbought."

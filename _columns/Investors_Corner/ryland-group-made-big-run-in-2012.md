[2013: A Look Back And Ahead](http://news.investors.com/special-report/638663-2013-a-look-back-and-ahead.aspx)


CAN SLIM stocks shone in the strong uptrend during 2012's first quarter. The next three quarters provided a tougher environment.


Check out how the IBD 50 index's Relative Strength line behaved over the course of the year (click [here](https://www.investors.com/search/searchresults.aspx?Ntt=IBD%2050%20Index&source=manager&in_dym=true) to see a daily chart). It tells such a story in Q4.


Still, there were big winners in 2012, as this current series in Investor's Corner is showing.


One of the year's leading stocks was **Ryland Group** ([RYL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RYL)). It's a homebuilder that was more of a turnaround play, rather than a perfect representation of IBD's CAN SLIM investing strategy.


The Westlake Village, Calif.-based builder had been enduring years of quarterly losses and declines in revenue, but its fundamentals improved markedly as 2012 progressed. The stock provided a way to bet on the housing market rebound that eventually came along.


Ryland had sketched a deeper-than-ideal, cuplike base in the second half of 2011. **(1)**


The stock tacked on a handle to that pattern in December 2011, creating a buy point at 16.32. **(2)** You also could have viewed the stock as having added an earlier handle in November 2011 — or just see that area as a period of tighter trade forming the base's right side. **(3)**


Ryland broke out past its 16.32 handle entry in the week ended Jan. 6, 2012. **(4)** This was just a couple of weeks after the follow-through day on Dec. 20, 2011, that confirmed a new market uptrend, so IBD-style investors had the green light to buy.


Note that volume wasn't that huge in the week ended Jan. 6, **(5)** but it was up from the prior week. Plus, turnover kicked in nicely during the following week. **(6)** Institutions were big buyers.


Sometimes you'll see volume pick up shortly after being light for the initial breakout. Many breakouts that show such action still end up providing nice gains — particularly if the market is strong and the sector is a leader.


Ryland has moved up well since its breakout at the start of 2012. It generally found support along its rising 10-week moving average as it advanced. The stock formed some more bases during the year and then broke out from those patterns, including its recent later-stage structure. Through Monday, it's up 130% for the year.

In the summer of 2017, a few eyebrows might have been raised when **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) gave up support at its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and longer-term support at the 200-day line.

Why would institutional investors be selling the stock amid healthy fundamentals and strong growth prospects?

Ulta offered hints that a pullback was possible after the stock hit a series of new highs in light volume when it cleared a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) in early May **(1)**. There's plenty of market precedent that shows that a pattern of new highs in light volume is a sign that a stock may be ready to take a breather — and that it's time to begin selling shares to nail down profits.

After a long run-up in price following a [good breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), new highs in low volume basically signals that buying demand is drying up.

A sequence of new highs in light volume isn't automatically a death sentence for a stock, but it is a yellow flag, especially for those investors with a nice gain.

Shares gapped up powerfully May 26 after the company reported another strong quarter, but a 5.8% intraday gain was nearly halved as shares rose 3%. It wasn't a bad day for Ulta, but the price action showed that sellers were around despite news of the company's seventh straight quarter of 20%+ sales growth.

## When To Sell Stocks: Study The Chart

Ulta rose for five straight sessions after that, in lukewarm turnover **(2)** that paled compared with the pair of high-volume sell-offs that took place a week earlier. Shares slumped 2% on June 6 in higher turnover, a negative sign. Then, over the next 12 sessions, five days of declines in higher volume vs. the prior session indicated that there had been more institutional selling. Ulta eventually gave up the 50-day moving average **(3)** and its 200-day line **(4)**.

After a low volume bounce off the 200-day moving average July 7, big sellers were in the stock again for the next two sessions.

Ulta has been a big winner since the start of bull market in March 2009. But with shares up more than 3,500%, serious questions now remain about the stock's ability to be a market leader again. Even a positive note Friday from Goldman Sachs wasn't much help for the stock. Early Friday, the stock gave back more than half of a 3.9% intraday gain.

The bull camp will point toward solid annual earnings estimates, high return on equity and an outstanding management team. The bears will argue that growth fund managers have been taking profits lately and Ulta's run as a market leader could be ending.

Part of Ulta's weakness is attributable to overall softness in the retail sector. Since June 1, the specialty retail industry group is down more than 10% compared to a mild gain of roughly 1.5% for the S&P 500.

It's impossible to keep emotions out of your trading, whether you're an individual working from a laptop in the bedroom or a steely-eyed hedge fund manager in a Manhattan skyscraper.

The reason is simple. We are emotional beings. Our hopes and dreams are tied up in our investments, be it the house we want to own someday, the secure retirement we hope to enjoy, or the college where we want to send our children. They are on our minds when we place that trade.

Emotions keep us from doing what's right. We're giddy with optimism at market tops, when we should be fearful. We're fearful at market bottoms, when courage is called for.

The road to success is paved with a set of historically validated rules that tell you what to buy and when, as well as when to sell and walk away. Follow those rules. That keeps your emotions at bay.

Hope is one emotion that can destroy a portfolio. If you buy a stock and it falls, you hope it comes back. You know it's a great company with solid fundamentals and an experienced management team.

If you think like that, you're bound to lose. It might be a good company, but that doesn't mean the stock can't go down and stay down for an extended time.

If you don't cut your loss, you're merely hoping the stock will come back. You must admit you made a mistake, sell and live to fight another day.

Inexperienced traders sometimes mask their hope by deciding they're long-term investors. Or worse, they average down, buying more shares of a falling issue.

Assume you owned shares of **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) in November 2006. The stock had been rising since late 2000. It had an IBD Composite Rating of 77 with dependable earnings growth and above-average stock performance. It had branches throughout the United States. There were no signs of trouble.

You had no way of knowing you owned BofA at the exact top. But the following year in 2007, the stock market topped.

The initial decline wasn't big. If you had bought it coming out of a cup-with-handle base in April 2006 at 47.24, you experienced a round trip. Your moderate gain was wiped out and you were back even.

If you failed to sell there, you found yourself with a small loss. No worries, you told yourself. It's a great company. Solid as a rock. Then the real decline began.

In March 2008, the investment house of Bear Stearns collapsed and was sold to **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) as mortgage-backed securities became a distressed asset class. This is something you didn't anticipate. By that time, BofA shares traded nearly 38% off their 55.08 high **(1)**.

This is where you might tell yourself: "I'm a long-term investor. I can't sell now because I'll be forced to take a big loss."

Just when you think things can't get any worse, they do. In September, another investment house, Lehman Bros., filed for bankruptcy. The federal government refused to bail it out. It triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

The failure to sell BofA would have resulted in a loss as much as 95%. The stock since then has come less than halfway back.

The initial experience with a terrific stock can sometimes feel like a boxing match.

Before the referee raises your arm in victory, you may have to take a few body blows, uppercuts and a black ego â€” oops, I meant eye.

Oh, you haven't had that happen before? Don't worry, a rough time in the ring will come someday.

Consider **EMC Corp.** ([EMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMC)), the heavyweight champion of data storage gear during the 1990s.

On June 1, 1992, the Hopkinton, Mass.-based company broke out of a textbook four-month double-bottom base in electrifying volume **1** (the accompanying chart is a weekly). Less than two years later, the stock had surged 765%.

The initial buy point was 15.98, 10 cents above the highest price within a downward-slanting three-week handle. Notice how trading became whisper-quiet as the handle drifted mildly lower **2**. It was a perfect final shakeout.

EMC broke out and made a six-day run; on the breakout day, the company had solid IBD ratings: an 82 EPS, an 88 RS and an A for Accumulation/Distribution.

However, the stock did not trigger the eight-week hold rule. It gained as much as 17%. A 20% rise in three weeks or less means you must hold it for eight weeks. So in EMC's case, you had to watch it closely and protect your profit.

The market's punches came fast. Over the next two weeks, EMC fell all the way back to as low as 15.63. It never fell more than 8% from the initial buy point, so technically you could have held. But the loss of a 17% paper gain would have made you woozy.

By late August, another fast decline might have sent some investors to the ropes. At 15.13, it was down as much as 5% below the buy point on an intraday basis **3**. Most players would have exited the stock by then, coming away with a small gain and a bruised ego.

So after you ducked once or twice, you needed to stay on your feet and keep your eyes open to land the stiff counterpunch.

That chance came in mid-September. EMC leapt out of a new double bottom with an 18.85 buy point in massive volume **4**. Although it didn't rise 20% in three weeks, it rallied 59% in just three months. Four months later, it formed another solid base and hit new highs.

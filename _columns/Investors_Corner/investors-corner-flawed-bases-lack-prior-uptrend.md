In the market, wishful thinking is a common mistake — even when it comes to analyzing bases.

It's tempting to favor a stock that has slumped for months, even years. You might feel it's going to make a terrific move one day. But such an assumption can be harmful to your portfolio health. Only stocks that have already shown they can make a big run have the true potential to make you money.

One of the critical elements of a chart pattern doesn't have to do with the pattern itself, but the action preceding it. If a stock has made a prior uptrend of 30% or higher before the start of a first-stage base, that's a good sign.

Why? Investors have shown a real liking for the stock. They believe in the company's products, quality of management and competitive position. Such a company tends to notch strong earnings and sales growth and industry-leading profit margins.

If a stock seems to have gone sideways for ages, however, forming base after base, you're probably better off parking your cash somewhere else. It's likely that earnings and sales have not grown rapidly.

It's perfectly normal for some stocks to move sideways for a long time. **Hawaiian Electric** ([HE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HE)) is a good example of how many utility stocks behave. From June to September 2008, it etched a three-month cup with handle **1**.

But rather than forming after a solid uptrend, the base took shape after Hawaiian Electric struggled for nearly a year and a half to build a base.

The stock's breakout past a 26.96 buy point lasted just three weeks. It dropped 59% from its high.

New issues are tricky investments, since they have no price history — be it uptrend or not — before going public. In most cases, it's smart to wait and watch, let the stock find its natural trading range, then produce some gains before setting up a real base pattern.

**Vanguard Health Systems** ([VHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VHS)) offers a fresh example of a stock lacking a prior uptrend. The stock went public at 18 on June 22, closing on its debut with a high of 18.58 and a close of 18.05. The sideways price action over the next four weeks seemed like a flat base in the making. But Vanguard deteriorated into a serious correction as the market tumbled into a correction.

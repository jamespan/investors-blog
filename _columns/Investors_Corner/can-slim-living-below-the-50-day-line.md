Prospecting for stocks is all about looking for strength over weakness. You want strong companies fundamentally, and you want strong stocks technically.


That's why you should look with suspicion on stocks that consistently trade below support levels and can't muster the muscle to blast through to new highs.


If a stock lives below its 50-day moving average on a daily chart or 10-week moving average on a weekly chart, that's a valid reason to sell it. Living below the line is defined as eight or nine weeks in a row.


**Prolonged Weakness Is A Warning**


A brief dip below the 50-day line is not, by itself, a sell signal. Many leading stocks will drop below the line, then recover to make a handsome advance or build a new base. It's the stock that can't recover above the line in a reasonable time that causes concern.


So living below the 10-week moving average is not only a sell signal. It's also smart to avoid a stock that has built a base where too much of the action is below the support line. The stock has demonstrated weakness when you would rather see strength.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) fell hard during the financial crisis of 2008. The maker of the iPhone, iPad and highly popular desktop and notebook computers has been one of the great winners of the past decade. But that doesn't mean that each base built over that time produces a good buy point.


That's true with all leading stocks. Besides being able to identify a potential leader with sound fundamentals, you have to be able to make sure that it is breaking out of a sound base.


Apple's return to greatness began with the introduction of the iPod in 2001. The iPod and iTunes remade the music business. Apple got a second shot in the arm from the debut of the iPhone in 2007, which remade the cell-phone business.


**Living Below The 10-Week Line**


Apple was riding high on the iPhone's success when it settled into a correction in January 2008. The general market was beginning a correction at the same time.


It dropped 10% and dipped below the 10-week line in the week ending Jan. 4 **(1)**, then fell sharply for another three weeks.


It hit bottom in the week ending Feb. 29, then began a recovery.


Yet there were already a few key flaws in the stock's base. First, it was late stage, which increases the risk that a breakout will falter.


Second, Apple corrected 43% in price from a high of 202.96. That's too much and, again, makes a high-risk base.


Finally, Apple spent 11 straight weeks below its 10-week moving average **(2)**. As the base shows, weekly volume on the upside was mostly subdued as the base's right side formed **(3)**.


Apple's cup-with-handle base lasted more than four months, but the stock never broke out. Instead, it rolled over.


When the Wall Street financial crisis hit later in the year, Apple was massacred along with everything else. The stock slid to as low as 79.14, down 61% from its peak.


After the crisis, Apple arose from the ashes and was once again a winner.


But riding it down and back up is no way to make big money in the stock market.

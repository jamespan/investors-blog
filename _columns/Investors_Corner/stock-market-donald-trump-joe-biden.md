President Joe Biden has left the White House with the S&P 500 up more than 55% and the Nasdaq composite up about 46% since he took office.


Biden's term began with the tail-end of the post-Covid bull market in 2021. It included a bear market in 2022 but also back-to-back gains of 24% and 28% in 2023-'24 in the S&P 500.




While the best-performing index during his tenure was the S&P 500 index, small-cap stocks lagged. The Russell 2000 climbed less than 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That's the worst presidential term ever for the small-cap benchmark.


All-Time Best Stock Market Performances
---------------------------------------


The S&P's increase during the Biden presidency ranks seventh among all presidents over the past seven decades.


The best-performing major index under President Biden's leadership was the S&P 500, with a 55.7% gain through the last trading session in his term on Friday. The Nasdaq composite had a 45.9% increase, followed by a 39.4% lift in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Under Trump's reign, the Nasdaq composite gained 137.6%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. (The Nasdaq was launched in 1971.) The S&P 500 rose 67.3% under Trump's watch.


Both Biden and Trump fell short of the all-time largest gain of 84.4% in the S&P 500, which occurred during President Barack Obama's first term from 2009 to 2013. Obama also produced the highest gain in the Russell 2000 during the same term, a 105.9% increase. The Russell index was started in 1984.


Obama's presidency included the post-financial crisis bull market.


Bill Clinton gets the highest index performance of any president, with a 110.8% surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during his first term from 1993 to 1997. The dot-com bubble formed during the final years of his second term. The Nasdaq roared 93.4% and 103.1% in his two terms, for a combined increase of 297.2%.


Stock Gains Between Election Days
---------------------------------


Counting the four-year periods between Election Days for the winning candidate, Biden saw the S&P 500 index rise more than 70% vs. Trump's 54.7% increase from the 2016 Election Day.


But Trump dominated in the Nasdaq, with a robust 111% boost that topped Biden's 62.9% increase. The outcome was reversed for the Dow, with Biden's election cycle lifting the blue chip index 52.1% vs. Trump's 46.9%.


During the current election cycle that began Nov. 5, and in preliminary results through Jan. 13, the Trump win initially produced lofty gains in November. But a large portion of those increases  evaporated amid weakness that began in December.

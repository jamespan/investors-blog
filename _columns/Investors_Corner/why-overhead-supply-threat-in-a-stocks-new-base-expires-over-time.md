  Why Overhead Supply Threat In A Stock's New Base Expires Over Time

Musical composition is a constantly shifting play between harmonic tension and release. In stock charts, the equivalent forces are resistance and support.


Resistance tamps stocks down and builds tension. Support buoys a stock up, often setting the stage for a release to new highs.


Support occurs as buyers step in at prescribed levels to maintain or boost a stock's price.


A stock hits resistance at levels where certain shareholders have decided to sell. An institution could be hitting its projected price target. Or the stock may be 20% to 25% above its most recent buy point, triggering some investors to take profits.


One specific form of resistance is called overhead supply. This scenario occurs when a stock has fallen well below its prior highs. Investors who bought in at the former, higher levels and who rode the stock through its downturn may now be underwater.


As shares approach their prior high, submerged investors are often ready to sell, hoping to get out while they can break even.


This makes buying breakouts from bases formed in the long, deep shade of prior highs risky.


Some leading stocks, such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) in early 2009, can muscle up from deep breakouts, pierce resistance from overhead supply and go on to winning runs.

But most stocks will stall -- or just plain crumble -- when the selling resistance sets in.


The upside: The threat of overhead supply diminishes after about 18 months. Those still holding on are probably in for the long haul, not likely to jump out at old highs.


A good example of such a lapse is Acme Packet after its February 2010 breakout. The supplier of networking gear had climbed from its October 2006 initial public offering at 9.50 to a December peak. Then it slipped into a very deep consolidation (see the monthly chart). This set the stage for an overhead supply scenario.


The stock swept through an 87% correction over the next two years. It dived 70% below the 9.50 IPO price as well.


In December 2009, Acme began the second part of a base-on-base pattern. At that point, it was well below the prior high, but also past the 18-month all-clear stage on overhead supply. When the base formed, the highest price since June 2008 was 12.25, marked in the week ended Dec. 18, 2009. So the correct entry point was 12.35, a dime higher.


Acme's average daily volume increased sharply over the course of the base, from 200,000 shares in December to 600,000 at the start of February.


At the time of the Feb. 3 breakout, Acme carried a 92 Composite Rating from IBD. It also held an A SMR grade and a C+ Accumulation/Distribution grade.


The breakaway gap past a 12.35 buy point occurred in massive volume and launched a 584% run that peaked in April last year.

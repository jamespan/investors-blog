If you're new to investing and struggling with the features, screens and unique charts of IBD, you may have wondered what a "base" is. You may have wondered why Investor's Business Daily uses the term a lot in its market-related news coverage.

Treat "base" as the most important four-letter word in your investing vocabulary.

Are you willing to learn about, then find, the good bases? Can you muster the courage to buy shares on strong breakouts to new highs amid a [general market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx)? If yes, you stand a great chance of delivering big returns to your stock portfolio.

## Why Bases Form

A base, and there are a handful of primary ones, visually represents a great stock's need to take a break. After a nice run-up in price, preferably 30% or more, such a stock will decline — in most cases, mildly. This is often the beginning of a new base. At some point, demand among mutual funds, banks, hedge funds, pension plans and the like suddenly spikes. So, too, does the stock's price. A breakout past a base's [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) begins.

Think of a base as similar to what mountaineers set up when they challenge the summit of K2 or Mount Everest. They don't go all the way up in one straight shot. Instead, they set up base camps along the way. Climb. Rest. Scale higher. Rest again. Climb again. Pause, then reach the top.

## Charts Are A Must-Have Tool

You need to use [good price-and-volume stock charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) in order to spot the most reliable bases identified by IBD. They are [the cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/); [the double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/); [the flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/); [the saucer](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/); [the base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/); [the high, tight flag](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-high-tight-flag-can-deliver-skyscraper-sized-gains/); [the ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/); and [the IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).

All of these bases have strict requirements and particular specifications. Yet all of them will show the same signs of institutional support and buying. Bases reflect the human emotions of fear and greed, interacting together.

In June and July of 2015, **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) produced a faulty cup **(1)** that did not give birth to a breakout. It formed over seven weeks, the bare minimum for any [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). Yet the V-shape was a major flaw.

The Chinese online games and internet content firm formed a much better cup base that features six weekly gains in a row ahead of the actual breakout at 150.07. Before that strong advance, NetEase fell lightly in low volume on the right side of the base **(2)**. That showed institutions were no longer selling with abandon.

A [great time to sell](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) came six weeks later **(3)**. NetEase hit as high as 186.45 and reached a profit of more than 20% from the buy point. Take gains when most of your holdings reach this threshold, and you create fresh cash in which to buy the next superb winner.

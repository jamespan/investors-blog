  Treat IBD 50 Mini Charts As Gold Mines Of Information

Great things come in small packages.


At the very least, that's the thinking behind every mini chart of stocks that make up the IBD 50.


You can't know everything about a stock before making that proverbial plunge and clicking "Buy." The chance to buy a great stock at the right price could vanish if you scrutinize it too long.


To focus on the right data, consider the information that goes into every IBD 50 chart, published in IBD every Monday and Wednesday.


Next to the company's name is the stock's industry ranking among 197 groups tracked every day by IBD. Don't forget: Up to half of a big winner's move stems from the strength of its industry group and broader sector.


Let's focus on the second line of data in the mini chart. The first number shows the stock's float, or shares freely traded. Generally, the smaller the float, the smaller supply of readily available shares. A stock with heavy demand and low supply can soar.


The next three pieces of data (Composite, EPS and RS) are all crucial — but in what way? The Composite and EPS scores tell you if a stock is truly superior in profit growth over a three- to five-year span. Combined with the RS, they indicate a stock's ability to outperform the market.


So, if you're happy with a market that rises 15% for the year, fine. Buy an index ETF and hope for the best. But a strong Composite and RS Rating can pinpoint stocks with the potential to rise 150%, often in less than a year.


Return on equity is valuable. But go beyond just the requirement of 17% ROE or better (as highlighted in [past Investor's Corner columns](https://www.investors.com/search/searchresults.aspx?source=filterSearch&Ntt=Investor%27s+Corner&Nr=OR%28Column%3aInvestor%27s+Corner%2cEducation%2fHelp+Type%3aInvestor%27s+Corner%29)). Why?


Often, the biggest market winners have ROE of 30% to 40% or higher. They simply make more money with less.


Let's look at Monday's edition of the IBD 50. **Questcor Pharmaceuticals** ([QCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOR)), **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) and **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) show an ROE higher than 30%. They've been rewarded by the market with big price runs.


Look below the two lines of text that describe what a company does. Check the second line of extra fundamental data, "Last Qtr EPS," "Prior Qtr" and "Last Qtr Sales." At a glance, you know what the company is doing in the here and now. If EPS growth is accelerating — a key trait among huge winners — then you'll see a black triangle pointing up. Circle those stocks for further study.


In the line below, see how many quarters in a row the company has posted EPS growth of more than 15%. When Lululemon was No. 20 in the then-IBD 100 on Oct. 4, 2010, it sported four quarters of greater than 15% EPS growth. The stock had just broken out of a double bottom at 43.47. It raced up 96% by February 2011.

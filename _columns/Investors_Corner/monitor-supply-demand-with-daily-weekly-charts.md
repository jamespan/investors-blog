Plenty of pundits dismiss charts when it comes to helping evaluate a stock's prospects for gains.

It's like reading tea leaves, they say, and investors are better off paying attention only to fundamentals and holding for the long term.

Cover your ears.

Charts are a visual display of supply and demand at work. Since supply and demand govern the stock market every day, it makes sense for charts to play a key role in the research process.

In recent days, this space has been devoted to following the footsteps of [institutional investors](http://education.investors.com/) in the stock market.

Knowing what they're buying is good information to have when deciding which stocks to own for your own portfolio.

After all, retail buying isn't the fuel for a stock's big gain. It's institutional buying.

Stocks with little or no fund sponsorship often have a hard time keeping up with the broad market, let alone the leaders.

If you desire the most up-to-date clues on what institutions are doing, look no further than a stock's daily and weekly charts. The ones at Investors.com make it easy to monitor institutional buying in a stock and make smart trading decisions.

Up days are in blue, and down days are in red. Big volume is a hallmark of institutional buying, so you'll want to pay attention to the volume bars at the bottom of the charts. The red line snaking through the volume bars plots the stock's average volume over the past 50 sessions.

On a daily chart, pay attention to strong closes, particularly when a stock on your watch list is building a good base.

On a weekly chart, count the number of accumulation weeks (up in above-average volume) vs. distribution weeks (weekly declines in heavy trade). Good stocks show more of the former.

There are times when a down week in heavy volume can be constructive. If a stock falls in heavy weekly volume but closes at least in the upper half of the weekly price range, it's called a support week. Count it as an accumulation week, not distribution.

**Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) cleared a couple of bases in 2013 that showed plenty of institutional buying. It first cleared a flat base during the week ended March 15, rising nearly 5% in strong volume **(1)**.

Four straight above-average volume weekly price gains in May signaled continued institutional buying **(2)**. That preceded another heavy-volume breakout from a flat base in late July **(3)**.

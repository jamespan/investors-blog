It's all good when a stock is climbing a long upward price path. But if it suddenly accelerates sharply above that path, watch out.

That's one way stock charts can tell you early on that a major price advance has ended. But to spot this subtle sell signal, several factors must be in place.

First, the stock must already have been trading within a long upward price channel. This consists of two parallel lines binding the price bars. The upper channel connects at least three highs, each progressively higher in price than the prior one; the lower channel strings together three higher lows.

The advance must be at least several months long from the moment the stock breaks out of a base until the sell signal can be taken seriously.

Only use a logarithmic weekly chart, which makes it much easier to see the true impact of percentage changes on a chart. IBD's weekly charts are based on a logarithmic scale.

The longer the upper channel line and the more peaks it touches, the better signals it can give.

## Reading The Sell Signal In Stock Charts

Once the stock surges above that upper channel line, the sell signal is triggered. This is the chart telling you the stock has become overheated, similar to a climax top.

IBD founder William O'Neil has elaborated on this sell rule, providing finer details on the most reliable cases. One, the upper channel begins as the stock makes its first pullback to the 10-week moving average after a base breakout. In other words, don't just start drawing the line at the breakout.

Two, there should ideally be at least 10 weeks between the first touch of the line and the next touch and a minimum 18 weeks in total that the line spans.

One example of a stock that flashed this sell signal was **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)).

The stock [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) at 37.09 in December 2012 and made a prolonged advance. The first pullback to the 10-week moving average occurred in February 2013, which was the time to start tracing the upper channel line.

Seventeen weeks went by before the line made its next touch. In all, the line spanned 25 weeks before a breach occurred in the week ended Aug. 2 of that year.

Lithia kept going up for a few weeks but sold off below its 10-week line in the heaviest volume since its breakout. That set off a [new sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).

Investors who want to be successful in the stock market must learn to use charts. Investing without them is like flying blind.

Actual mastery of chart patterns can take years, depending on the individual. This is not something that you can pick up over the weekend. But you can speed up your learning with many resources from IBD and its sister companies.

When looking at charts, new investors may only see squiggly lines. But seasoned chart readers will see a picture of the health of a stock. Once you learn to read charts, you can tell whether something good or bad is setting up. Charts are an investor's must-use tool. If you read a stock's action right and catch the breakout, you could be handsomely rewarded.

It's one thing just to recognize a double-bottom or a rare ascending base on a chart. But seeing the finer details that make for a strong or faulty pattern will only come after studying hundreds, maybe thousands, of charts.

First and foremost, investors have to learn the basics of each chart pattern. You've got to know that a double-bottom base needs at least seven weeks to form and that the second low should undercut the first low. Know what you're looking for before you actually go looking. See the tutorial on the basics of chart patterns at [IBD University](http://education.investors.com/) at Investors.com. Learn the patterns first and then move on to other resources.

• **IBD 50 Mini Charts**. Published every Monday and Wednesday. (IBD Leaderboard users can see the IBD 50 every day.) Study these charts of 50 of the market's top stocks. Look at what type of base each is in and then go over the week by week action.

Under each chart is a short description of the current price action. But before you look at it, cover it up and guess what's being said about the stock.

Besides the IBD 50, mini charts will appear in Tuesday's [Big Cap 20](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-big-cap-20.htm) and Friday's [Your Weekly Review](http://news.investors.com/investing/your-weekly-review.htm?page=2). You'll have plenty of practice material.

• **Daily Stock Analysis**. Available in text and video, the [DSA](http://education.investors.com/daily-stock-analysis) will help investors hone their chart skills. DSA highlights key elements of a stock that's in a base or a secondary setup. Reading the text or watching DSA videos will help you properly identify and analyze bases or secondary buying opportunities. Use DSA as your technical analysis tutor.

In late June, a DSA on chipmaker **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) noted that the stock formed a base-on-base pattern, since the breakout from a prior base resulted in a gain of less than 20% before starting another base.

• **Chart Arcade**. Learning can be tedious, but it doesn't always have to be. [MarketSmith's](http://www.marketsmith.com/) Chart Arcade (requiring a separate subscription) makes it fun to learn and practice your chart skills.

Chart Arcade is an online stock market game that lets investors buy and sell stocks, including some from the 1900s. This is a game, so no real money is on the line. This is a good way to practice what you've learned about CAN SLIM investing.

• **The Short Side column**. Most investors will generally only buy stocks and not sell short, but experienced investors should learn about short selling too. There is money to be made on both sides of the market. [The Short Side](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/071913-664479-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) highlights some of the best patterns to short from. Published each Monday, the column teaches how to short past huge market winners that have broken down.

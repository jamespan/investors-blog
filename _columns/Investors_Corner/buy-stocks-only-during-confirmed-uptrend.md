  Let Major Indexes Dictate Buy, Sell Decisions

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite serve as guideposts to the market's health. Ignore them at your own peril.

  

Every day, IBD analyzes the action of these major stock averages to determine whether the market is in an uptrend (healthy) or a correction (not so healthy or very weak).

  

Why should investors know the status of the overall market in deciding when to buy or sell a stock? The best stocks tend to break out of bases with success during a confirmed uptrend. Conversely, most stocks fall during a correction, no matter how strong their recent fundamentals.

  

Failure to heed the market's trend could make the difference between racking up a nice profit or taking a significant loss on your investments.

  

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq help distill the action of thousands of publicly traded stocks. The S&P 500 is generally broader-based than the Nasdaq in terms of industry sectors. Yet many big winners hail from the Nasdaq market. So watch both.

  

S&P 500 membership consists solely of big-cap stocks. The Nasdaq is weighted more toward technology issues and is broader in terms of market capitalization; it offers a large helping of small-cap and midcap stocks.

  

IBD readers can track the action of both the S&P and the Nasdaq each day with charts on the What's The Market Trend? page (today on B2). IBD also provides a chart of the Dow Jones industrial average, but its value as a market barometer is limited; it tracks only 30 large-cap stocks.

  

The daily Big Picture (today on B3) provides a roundup of daily market action and discusses leading stocks that moved in heavy volume. The Market Pulse box accompanying the column gives a quick snapshot of the day's action and describes the market's status.

  

The market's status changed on Oct. 21, when the Nasdaq jumped 2.4% **(1)** and the S&P 500 climbed 2% in volume that was higher than the previous day. It marked a fourth-day follow-through that changed the current outlook from "correction" to "market in confirmed uptrend."

  

Growth stocks thrive during a confirmed uptrend. The IBD 50 jumped 3.1% on Oct. 21; the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 1.6%. The action of these growth-oriented indexes supported the birth of a new uptrend.

  

Drugmakers **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)), **Lannett** ([LCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCI)) and **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), insurance firm **AmTrust Financial** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)) and auto parts retailer **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) were among the growth stocks that broke out of bases soon after the new uptrend began. Not every breakout will work. But the market's biggest winners often emerge early in an uptrend.

  

In Wednesday's paper, the Market Pulse shows one distribution day for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Distribution days occur when the major averages fall at least 0.2% in higher volume than the prior session. A high distribution count — say, five or six or more — could be a sign that the market's uptrend is getting tired or due for a pullback.

  

An excessive number of distribution days and poor action by leaders may mean that a serious correction has arrived. At that point, investors should raise cash and sell stocks, especially ones that aren't performing well or that have a small profit cushion.

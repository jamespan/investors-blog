  Volume Is Key To Gauging Health Of A Stock, Market

Volume analysis is key to evaluating a stock's base and the health of its breakout past a proper buy point.


A stock that clears its buy point in light volume is suspect. Bases that show a stock falling more in above-average volume than rising in above-average trade also indicate weakness.


Strong volume indicates that institutional investors are really engaged in the stock. These hedge funds, mutual funds and pension funds have the financial power to send stocks — and the overall market — soaring or plunging. Individual investors should follow their lead.


"Volume is a remarkable subject that is worthy of careful study," wrote IBD Chairman William J. O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


"It can help you recognize when a stock is under accumulation (institutional buying) or distribution (institutional selling). Once you acquire this skill, you won't have to rely on the personal opinions of analysts and supposed experts," he added.


It's important to analyze daily and weekly volume as the stock builds a base and crosses key junctures, such as a breakout from a base. On the breakout, volume should ideally rise at least 40% to 50% above the stock's 50-day average. At a secondary buy point, such as a rebound off the 10-week line, you'd like to see volume rise above average.


The "Stocks on the Move" table (on page B6) also shows stocks that are moving in heavy volume.


"Making buys at the wrong time or, worse, buying stocks that are not under accumulation or that have unsound or faulty price patterns is simply too costly," O'Neil wrote.


Chinese auto information website **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) cleared a seven-week cup with handle in early October 2013. The stock cleared the 17.31 buy point Oct. 1 in volume that was 188% above the 50-day average — well above the 40% jump you'd like to see on a breakout.


On the next day, BitAuto followed through with a 7% gain to new highs in nearly triple normal trade. The weekly chart also shows strong volume 1. From there, BitAuto rose 171% in five months before correcting and slicing through its 50-day line in heavy turnover in early April.


Investors can assess whether volume is heavy at the moment a stock clears its buy point by tracking intraday volume. For example, if a stock clears its buy point one hour into a session, you can divide its average daily trading volume by 6.5 hours — the length of a daily trading session — to get average volume per hour. Then compare it to the volume at the breakout to see if turnover at that point is at least 40% higher than the average hourly volume.


You can obtain intraday trading volume on a financial website so you don't have to wait until end of day. The Stocks On The Move table on the home page of Investors.com shows intraday volume changes throughout the session.

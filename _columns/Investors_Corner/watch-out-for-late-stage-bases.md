Wall Street adages survive because there's truth in them. One that has survived generations goes like this: Trees do not grow to the sky.

  

In other words, a stock won't go up forever, no matter how great the company, how brilliant its management, how irresistible its products or how stable the economic environment.

  

But generation after generation rediscovers this maxim — the hard way.

  

So, how high is too high? To the disciplined chart reader, this translates into counting bases. Experience teaches that it's fine to buy a stock that has already made a significant advance if the stock is breaking out of a sound base.

  

It's also fine to buy stocks with high P-E ratios. In fact, most fast-growing companies have high P-E ratios; research shows that buying stocks just because they are "cheap" is ultimately a loser's game.

  

Stocks breaking out of first- and second-stage bases are best, but after that, they should be considered late stage. The risk of failure is greater in late-stage bases.

  

A few great stocks can make a few more bases during a long and powerful advance, but they are usually stocks with outstanding fundamentals and are recognized as industry and sector leaders.

  

To count bases, look at a long-term weekly chart. Spot all the occasions when the stock corrected, formed a new base, broke out, advanced at least 20%, then built a new base and broke out again.

  

When a stock breaks out for the first time, it might be little known among public investors. But the smart money managers and their analysts know about it and are buying. Their actions help form the base and cause the breakout.

  

But after a big advance, everybody knows about it. The CEO has been interviewed multiple times on television. Magazines have published cover stories. Analysts are piling on with buy recommendations and breathtaking predictions.

  

**Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) broke out of a flat base Jan. 21, 2014. The fundamentals were stellar. The company had just reported the best quarterly earnings-per-share growth in more than a year, up 40% with sales up 33%. The five-year annualized EPS growth rate was 52%. Analysts were expecting hefty gains for the next two years.

  

Everyone knows about the company and its leadership in the online travel industry — as well as actor William Shatner as its spokesman.

  

The base, however, was fifth stage. It turns out it could break out — for a while. After a hiccup, Priceline retook its 1198.10 buy point in February and advanced 15% **(1)**. Then the party ended. Priceline began to underperform the market.

  

The breakout was in volume just 24% above average. That was the first tip-off something might be wrong. Volume should be at least 40% above average, although in a big-cap name like Priceline a breakout could still work even if volume was on the lighter side.

  

The stock almost immediately fell 8%, forcing an investor to sell. The stock made one more gasping advance, and from then on failed to participate in the rally.

  

In Priceline's case, the fifth-stage base was one base too many.

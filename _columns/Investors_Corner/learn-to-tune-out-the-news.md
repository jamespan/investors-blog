Corporate earnings, economic data, political developments, war, natural disasters and other news events can move the stock market each day.

But paying too much attention to the news can lead you to make poor decisions that can harm your portfolio.

"Ticker tape watching or being glued to your PC or watching the market on a TV channel all day can get dangerously emotional," wrote IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil in "How to Make Money In Stocks."

Instead, stick with a solid set of buy and sell rules. Are you new to IBD? Get on the right track by reading this column every day. Use [IBD University](http://education.investors.com/) on Investors.com, free to all readers.

To remove emotions from investment decisions, focus primarily on the market's overall trend, strong industry sectors and individual stocks' fundamentals and chart characteristics.

Economic reports are often lagging indicators, describing what happened in the past month or quarter. And news headlines tend to reflect the emotional state of the market on that day. Gains are usually accompanied by stories touting the emerging bull market. Losses get amplified by headlines fretting about a possible crash just around the corner.

That's not to say investors should just ignore GDP reports, notable news or, say, the potential impact of a natural disaster on certain companies. But it's important to prevent these events from making you too optimistic or pessimistic.

The economy and the markets are complicated, so don't react as you might think they would, or should, given the circumstances.

In late 2011, it would have been easy to have been pessimistic. Stocks were mired in a bear market as the Nasdaq sank 20% from its early July peak. Newspapers were filled with headlines about Europe's looming implosion, slowing growth in China, violence in the Middle East and the fallout from Japan's devastating earthquake earlier that year.

But on Dec. 21, 2011, IBD readers who had checked the Market Pulse box would have found that the Nasdaq, the NYSE and the S&P 500 had followed through, placing the market in a confirmed uptrend and giving the green light to buy stocks.

Those who had ignored the news and instead paid attention to the market reaped the benefits of a nice stock market rally. From its close at 2603.73 on Dec. 20, the Nasdaq rose 20% in just three months to a peak of 3134.17 on March 27, 2012.

The follow-through day was a signal to investors that it was OK to buy stocks with superior fundamentals that were hitting proper buy points in sound bases.

Top-rated stocks broke out shortly after the follow-through day. They included **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which cleared a 427.85 buy point in a cup-with-handle base in late January and ran up 51% to 644 in just three months.

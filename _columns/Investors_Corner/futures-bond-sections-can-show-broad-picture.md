**How To Profit From MAKING MONEY:** [Fifth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/603354/201203061545/how-to-profit-from-ibds-making-money-.aspx)

IBD's Making Money section offers you mountains of information every day. You never know what will come in handy.

Take the Futures and Futures & Bonds pages. Here you'll find a focus that gets less attention in the rest of the paper.

The Treasury bond column offers you loads of insights each day on the economy, both here and abroad. You'll also discover the latest moves from the Federal Reserve, as well as what some of the Street's best minds think those policymakers will do in the near future.

Read into the ebbs and flows of demand for T-bonds, a key safe haven. When demand surges, it's often because of bad news — economic slumps, war, the EU crisis. Bad events create fear which, in turn, build demand for bonds.

Why do you care? Because that fear also saps demand from stocks.

But not always. Recent events show that the EU crisis, Iran's aggressive moves and other worrisome trends have done little to hold back what has been a solid bull market.

Why else would you care? Because the stock market loves low interest rates. That lower threshold for businesses encourages investment and consumption.

Do these two factors contradict each other? Maybe. That's what makes it so interesting.

Now look at the futures column. Maybe you don't care about the corn harvest or coffee stockpiles. But a glance at the daily charts and a read of the futures column also will lend insight that may be of use.

How does the dollar look? Oil? Can higher commodity prices be important to stock investors? Yes.

Look at the infamous crude oil explosion that peaked in July 2008 at \$147 per barrel. Prices had been rising steadily since early 2002, from about \$20 per barrel.

**Southwestern Energy** ([SWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWN)), an oil producer, screamed higher with oil in the mid-2000s. Its discoveries and output soared in value. But the impact of triple-digit oil prices also was felt by, of all things, **Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)).

That's right, fertilizer. Follow the bouncing logic.

As oil prices soared, so did U.S. ethanol, the much-decried oil additive (read substitute). So far that makes sense. Remember, ethanol in the U.S. is made from corn. Naturally, corn prices exploded with oil, as the world realized that corn was not just food anymore, but energy.

Farmers diverted many acres to corn at the expense of wheat and soybean output — indeed, most other crops.

In effect, the market was screaming for expanded agricultural output, much of it due to energy and newfound wealth in emerging markets. So, farmers the world over had to put more acres to work. What did they have to buy to grow more corn? Acres, and fertilizer.

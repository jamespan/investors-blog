Mention the word "flat" in a conversation about stocks, and images of dull, laggard performance come to mind. But that's not necessarily the case with stock charts. In fact, a flat base is one of the few reliable patterns that quality stocks form before they make substantial price advances.




While it may seem like a stock is going nowhere for weeks, it may be quietly winding itself up for a big climb.


Look for these characteristics to spot a proper flat base from ordinary, meaningless sideways action in a chart:


* After a prior advance, the stock declines a modest amount — no more than 15% from its prior high to its low.
* The shallow consolidation takes place over five weeks or a bit longer.
* Often a flat base develops after a stock breaks out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) or other [sound base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), and climbs 20% or more from the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Thus, flat bases usually aren't first-stage bases. They'll usually be second- or third-stage bases.

To find the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), look for the highest price at the start of the correction and add 10 cents.


As with any other breakout, volume should be at least 40% above the stock's 50-day average when shares climb above the [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The price as well as the volume should make a decisive move to new highs.

A Bullish Flat Base In 2010
---------------------------


In the summer of 2010, Rovi traded sideways for a period of seven weeks, from August through mid-September **(1)**. That was a flat base, with the stock declining 9% from peak to bottom. The base followed an undefined pattern that spanned from late April until early July.


Price action in the base was mostly calm. When you see a chart with tight price movements, that's an indication that institutional investors are accumulating shares.


The buy point was 45.06, or 10 cents above the prior high **(2)**. Rovi — which no longer trades publicly — cleared that level on Sept. 8 **(3)**. Although volume was strong, the stock closed the day below the buy point. Prudent investors would have waited for a more convincing breakout.


Indeed, that day came on Sept. 20, when the stock gapped up, adding 9% as volume swelled more than four times its average **(4)**. Shares of the company, which makes technology for TV listings, rose more than 50% to a peak on Jan. 14.


Rovi's fundamentals were sound. Earnings had risen 41% to 56% in the three quarters before the breakout. Sales growth was mediocre, but the three-year sales growth rate was 76%.


In the past few weeks, **Atkore** ([ATKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATKR)) and **Martin Marietta Materials** ([MLM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLM)) broke out of flat bases and are making progress. **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) has been a winner from a flat base breakout in January.

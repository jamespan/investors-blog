**Your IBD Routine:** Part 1 | [Part 2](https://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/564859/201103031657/Corner-Use-Weekly-Routine-To-Spot-Emerging-Leaders.aspx)

A tightly organized, half-hour run through IBD features each morning can set you up with a firm grasp of the market's direction, top industries and a handful of leading stocks to freshen your watch list.

Try the basic routine outlined below for starters. Modify it to best suit your own learning and investing style. Load it into the My Routine function at Investors.com to facilitate the process.

**1. Read Big Picture and Market Pulse.** This is your single most important resource when it comes to timing your buys and portfolio management. The Big Picture sums up the day's action and places it in a larger context. It holds the focus on leading stocks and on institutional activity, with insight into whether it's prudent to buy stocks or raise cash. Got only 60 seconds in the morning? The Market Pulse table gives you a snapshot of the day's action.

**2. Scan Stock Spotlight (formerly called Stocks In The News).** This concise feature serves up 16 minicharts of companies with strong fundamentals and which are either in or just breaking out of base patterns. The accompanying article gives added insight into specific companies and their charts.

**3. Use Stocks On The Move at Investors.com and in IBD's B section.** This tool lists stocks with healthy fundamentals moving in heavy volume. That suggests they are being bought or sold actively by institutional investors. The "up" side of this table is a great place to find up-and-coming leaders. The "down" side gives a good read on which leaders may be suffering distribution or topping.

**4. Skim IBD Industry Themes**. This daily column offers a unique perspective on overall market activity. This column tracks the 197 industry groups defined by IBD, with an emphasis on the top 20.

It outlines the fundamentals driving group action, and sorts the stocks in rising groups in search of fresh leadership potential. This is key; research shows nearly 50% of a great stock's price move from breakout point to peak is linked to its industry group and sector.

**5. Read IBD's Market Update at Investors.com.** Is your lunch date late? Got a few minutes before the kids come home? These updates throughout the day give you a running commentary on leading stock action and provide analysis of chart patterns, including proper buy points.

When time permits, check out Research Table Review and International Leaders. Timesaver TableÂ sums up IBD's highest-rated stocks, listing their volume and price action for the day.

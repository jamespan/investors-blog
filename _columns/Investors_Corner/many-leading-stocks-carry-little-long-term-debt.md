The bigger the debt, the harder it is for borrowers to dig out of the hole. The same often holds true for companies too.


"Rule 1 for all competent investors and homeowners is never ever borrow more than you can pay back. Excessive debt hurts all people, companies and governments," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


IBD uses the long-term debt-to-equity (LTD-to-E) ratio to determine if a company is showing too much borrowing risk. The ratio is simply a company's long-term debt divided by shareholders equity, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage figure.


A ratio of 100% or more implies that a firm is borrowing at an aggressive pace to fuel its expansion. It could also indicate a company is overreaching and not growing in a disciplined manner. By the same token, if a company's LTD-to-E ratio is falling year to year, it might be worth a second look. "A corporation that's been reducing its debt as a percentage of equity over the last two or three years is worth considering," O'Neil wrote. "If nothing else, interest costs will be sharply reduced, helping to generate higher earnings for share."


So when comparing two stock candidates for purchase, assuming they are in the same industry and all else being equal, pick the company with the smaller LTD-to-E ratio.

Firms in the telecom, heavy construction, and oil and gas exploration fields tend to carry heavier debt. Yet in other industries, the best-run companies may carry zero long-term debt. So be sure not to compare stocks from different industries. Do an apples-to-apples comparison.


A company may take on debt for various uses. For instance, a business that is growing via acquisitions may need cash to fund those purchases, with the idea that the buys will help it expand going forward. Or a telecom company wants to build more towers to reach its ultimate goal of growing its subscriber base.


In a study of the greatest stock market winners, IBD found that many of them didn't have much debt.


The accompanying table shows current leaders with outstanding EPS and RS ratings, priced at least \$20 a share, and an average daily volume of at least 1 million shares. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)), **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), show zero to low single-digit debt ratios.


**Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)), **Extra Space Storage** ([EXR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXR)), **Hawaiian Holdings** ([HA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HA)) and **Verizon Communications** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) occupy the higher end. Beer and wine maker Constellation has made a number of acquisitions over the past few years and is planning to expand its Nava brewery in northeast Mexico. Verizon has been spending on wireless spectrum space to build out its wireless network.


Companies can finance future investments in new products, services or plants and equipment by issuing new shares as well. This too can dilute shareholder value in the long run.

**IBD Exclusive Series  
[Hope, Fear And Greed:  
Psychological Barriers To Successful Investing](/NewsAndAnalysis/SpecialReport.aspx?id=562114)**

---

It's great to feel convinced when you buy a stock.

You ought to have been persuaded by the issue's fundamentals, its story, its chart and broader trends.

One danger, however, is that you might stay convinced forever.

You don't want to catch yourself falling so deeply in love with a stock that you come to believe that it will always be a market leader.

But this does happen for many investors. And it becomes a key psychological barrier to success. Some might refuse to accept the fact that the only constant is change.

Instead of getting stuck on a stock, you ought to stay detached, be ready to exit your position and keep an eye out for other opportunities. What's more, you want to continue to learn about new trends and innovative new companies.

Why keep learning?

IBD's research has found that only one out of every eight market leaders in a given bull cycle will return to lead in the next broad uptrend. Moreover, the average leader in a major bull market, after peaking, falls 72%.

Fortunately, IBD has several regular features that are designed to help you keep learning.

For starters, The New America page provides daily articles about top-performing companies, including startups and turnaround stories. At the top of that page, the Aftermarket graphic highlights the action of recent IPOs.

The Internet & Technology section also puts a spotlight on innovative firms, as well as on tech industry trends like cloud computing or video on demand. Plus the Trends & Innovations section covers recent breakthroughs or new research.

You also get a sense of what industries are leading the market in the "How's The Market?" page, which ranks the 197 industry groups tracked daily by IBD. The groups get rated based on price performance over the past six months.

This lineup of 197 industry groups has changed over the years (see table). It's been updated because, as noted earlier, the only constant in the market is change.

For example, software products continue to grow in number and variety. So rather than just having one software industry group, as was the case back in 1997, IBD now has 10. After all, firms creating software for hospitals can be quite different from those producing security applications. So it's best not to lump them all together.

Energy-Solar also didn't exist back in 1997; outsourcing firms didn't have their own group either. But these sectors now have expanded, provided stock market leaders and grown large enough to justify their own industry groups.

When many companies with questionable fundamentals start launching initial public offerings, it can be a sign the market is overheating.

Yet in general, a strong IPO market is most often a good sign for the CAN SLIM investor.

IBD tracks IPO trends and runs stories on new companies ranging from blockbusters like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) to lesser-known entities such as China's **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)), which went public on Dec. 11.

**How to watch the IPO market**

IBD publishes tables on the price performance of recent IPOs along with a list of upcoming IPO filings (today on Page A6). IPO Aftermarket, on top of The New America page (also on A6), highlights the best recent performers.

The reason: IPOs are vital to a healthy stock market. Ideally, you'd like to see Goldilocks conditions â€” not too hot (as was the case during the dot-com craze) and not too cold (as was the case during the slump of 2008-09, when few companies listed.)

IBD recommends that investors zero in on stocks that have gone public in the past 15 years, as such stocks have the best chance of becoming big winners.

Before deciding to buy any stock, even IPOs, investors should check the Market Pulse that accompanies the Big Picture column (today on Page B2). It offers a gauge of the market's overall condition and highlights the performance of market-leading stocks, which are also key indicators.

The IPO market overheated during the now-infamous tech boom of the late 1990s to 2000. Hundreds of tech firms went public, often with no profits and very little in sales, raking in billions of investor cash, only to fail when the dot-com bubble burst.

No matter how hot the story, a company that lacks solid earnings and sales might not survive for long. An investor who sticks with CAN SLIM criteria is more likely to find true growth names.

**Sock puppet companies**

One famous case was Pets.com, which sold pet supplies to retailers but was losing money, and soon burned through \$300 million in investment capital. Despite gaining fame for a sock puppet in its TV ads, the company went bankrupt in November 2000, nine months after its IPO.

So far this year, a total of 221 companies have launched IPOs, raking in a total of more than \$50 billion. Both figures are the highest since 2000, according to Renaissance Capital.

Excessive price moves after a public debut can also indicate froth in the market. For example, **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) has already soared as much as 132% from its initial offering at \$26 a share since it debuted last month, even though it has yet to post a profit.

But such anecdotal evidence doesn't necessarily mean the market is now overheating. For one thing, the Nasdaq hasn't risen as sharply as it did from early 1999 to the early spring of 2000, when the tech-heavy index more than doubled to a March 10, 2000, high of 5,132.

In contrast, the Nasdaq is up nearly 34% this year and remains well below its all-time peak. Investors and venture capitalists have become more cautious and demand that companies show a better track record of sales and profits, Twitter notwithstanding.

With the overall tighter scrutiny, using IPOs as an indicator of market froth may be less useful now, but it is still a secondary gauge of the market's health.

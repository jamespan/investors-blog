Sometimes you see a stock's base yield a complete failure, but only close scrutiny would expose that pattern's singular flaw. Then you have stocks like eCollege.com, which built a base that cried out, "Escape while you can!"


Online educator eCollege.com shined brightest in 2003, soaring from its 10-week moving average in April of that year (at 4.35) and peaking seven months later at 26.71. But its action from November 2003 to February 2004 told a less optimistic story. The ship had hit an iceberg. That message appeared in the form of a base full of flaws.


Let's count how many ways that last cup-with-handle base was trying to tell you to go:


•**Wide, sloppy action.** Even after a long run-up, one can find few swings as wide as those found in this base. For instance, in the week ended Dec. 5, 2003, the stock swung 44% from its high to low **(1)**. That's excessive. If institutions want the stock, their bids will be aggressive enough to prevent such day-to-day swoons.


•**A deep cup.** This cup holds a 42% correction, deeper than the 30%-to-35% maximum you want to see in a base-building process. This is not what you'd expect from a stock that's under accumulation by the big-money funds.


•**Too much base-building below the 10-week line.** If institutions are eager to buy the stock, they'll bid above that key line.


•Downside volume spike. The week ended Dec. 5, 2003, saw eCollege sl ide 16% and slice the 10-week line in the highest volume of the run **(2)**. That's another sign that institutions were looking for an exit, not an entry.


•**Low handle.** Regular readers of this column know that a low handle means trouble. The handle is a quiet time that should appear just shy of the cup's right-side high. The handle midpoint (the average of the handle's intraday price high and low) should exceed the base's midpoint.


•**Upward-wedging handle.** This happens when the lows in a handle are rising, not sloping lower. The handle is all about shaking out weak hands in a quiet environment. When this happens, wise, patient hands are buying those shares — without chasing them higher just yet.


But if the handle is wedging higher, where's the shakeout?


So what happened to eCollege? It broke out Feb. 18 with a 2% rise on heavy volume. But it closed that day 2% below its 23.35 buy point, and in the lower 60% of the day's trading range. And from there, the school got straight F's.

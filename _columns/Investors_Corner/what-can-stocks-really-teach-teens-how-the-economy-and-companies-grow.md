Americans love to compete. Teenagers and the stock market are no different.

You may have heard about the annual [Capitol Hill Challenge](http://www.sifma.org/chc/) in which high school teams across the country try to earn the highest possible return over a 14-week period on a hypothetical \$100,000 portfolio. The Wall Street Journal's Jason Zweig wrote about it in May 2015, noting how young students are encouraged to take the biggest risks possible -- biotech firms with no earnings, extra-large-sized positions, buying stocks on margin -- if they want to win.

"If your own children are studying the stock market in school, you had better ask them what they have been learning. They might need to be deprogrammed," Zweig wrote.

If you are a teen or new to investing, what should you do?

First, accept the fact that randomness and luck will play a role in your results.

Second, know that there are multiple paths of success. You could own shares in a good mutual fund or a broadly diversified equity index ETF for decades. Or you could learn and apply a proven system of sound rules that reflect how the stock market really works, such as IBD's **[CAN SLIM approach](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749)**. IBD's rules help you maximize your gains during a bull market, which on average tends to last three to four years.

Third, once you've decided on a strategy that fits your personality and temperament, follow it 100%. Patience, preparation and discipline also count big.

The American Association of Individual Investors conducts its own independent, real-time study of various investing strategies, from deep value to income to growth. AAII found that from January 1998 to December 2014, the CAN SLIM system produced an average annual gain of 25.1%.

"After many years, I've concluded that successful stock selection is 60 to 65 percent knowing every key fundamental fact about a company and its industry and 35 to 40 percent understanding chart and market action," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in "The Successful Investor."

**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) is in the news today for the same reasons as it was in the summer of 2010: good growth, good stock action, and a breakout. A young person can appreciate how more and more people wish to travel. Priceline continues to lead a revolution in the way people plan their travel online.

In the week ended Aug. 6, 2010, the stock cleared a well-formed cup-with-handle base. It made IBD's Sector Leaders screen. The leisure sector ranked No. 9 out of 33 sectors. In the breakout week, the ratings were spectacular: 99 Composite; 99 EPS; 96 RS; three-quarter average sales growth of 29%. Investors following the CAN SLIM principles had plenty of reason to buy.

After rising 140% from a 234.10 buy point, Priceline went sideways. A nine-month snooze allowed Priceline to form a new base. It broke out again in February 2012.

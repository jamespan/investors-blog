Big-cap stocks are sometimes like the tortoise in the Aesop's fable "The Tortoise and the Hare," lumbering along while rabbit-like growth stocks speed ahead. But sometimes, as in the fable, slow-and-steady really does win the race.

Just look at the charts of **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Reynolds American** ([RAI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAI)) and **O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) in recent years.

IBD's [Big Cap 20](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-big-cap-20.htm) column, which appears in IBD every Tuesday, showcases stocks that have solid growth potential. They must also have a market capitalization of at least \$15 billion.

These behemoths often trade millions of shares a day and yet give investors a chance to reap significant capital gains with less volatility than small-cap growth stocks, which can fall much faster.

Furthermore, big-cap stocks often pay dividends, which can significantly boost returns over time.

Top big-cap stocks should still have fundamental and technical characteristics similar to the strongest growth stocks. High-quality big caps should show good profit and sales growth, rising [mutual- and hedge-fund sponsorship](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-income-investor.htm) column has featured Reynolds American more than a dozen times this year.

Both IBD Big Cap 20 and the Dividend Leaders screen have showcased Starbucks, which has given shareholders stellar returns for those patient enough to sit through a number of bases formed over the years. The coffee seller has risen nearly 600% in the five years since it broke out past a 13.34 buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) of a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Oct. 15, 2010.

At the time, Starbucks had Composite and Earnings Per Share Ratings of 87 out of 99. The annualized dividend of 64 cents a share produces a 1% yield; the long-term dividend growth rate is 24%. And with a 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of 0 (stable) to 99 (wild), investors stand a reasonable chance of continuing to reap steady stock price and dividend gains.

A number of real estate investment trusts and utility stocks have also fared well in recent years, as low interest rates reduced their borrowing costs and made it easier for them to invest in new power plants or assets such as apartments and hospitals.

**DTE Energy** ([DTE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DTE)) and **Omega Healthcare Investors** ([OHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OHI)) have been a fixture in the Dividend Leaders and REIT Leaders screens.

DTE, an electricity and natural gas supplier that also operates gas pipelines, has been a slow-but-steady gainer since it cleared a long consolidation with a 49.16 buy point in March 2011.

The stock briefly stumbled, triggering the 8% loss rule during the steep summer correction that year. However, DTE formed a new base with a 52.92 buy point and broke out again for good in December. Through a Jan. 28, 2015, high of 92.27, it gained 74%. DTE's long-term dividend growth rate is 5% and its annual dividend of \$2.92 a share currently yields 3.6%.

The accompanying table shows some big caps and dividend plays that have performed well so far this year.

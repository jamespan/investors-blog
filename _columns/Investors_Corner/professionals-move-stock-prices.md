It takes big demand to move a stock sharply higher, which is something that only professional investors can do. Individuals buying round lots are not going to have a big impact on a stock's price. It's going to take a lot more firepower than that to move a stock sharply up.



Institutional sponsorship, the "I" in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2), stands for ownership by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions and other big investors. Their activity accounts for the bulk of trading on the major exchanges. So it's good for a stock to have their backing.


Armed with millions to even billions of dollars to invest on behalf of clients, professionals tend to buy thousands of shares at a time. They don't tend to go in and buy a full position all at once, since that would run up prices too much.


It may take a fund weeks or months to build up to a full position. Mutual funds report their holdings to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) every quarter. Investors can find information on holdings in Form N-Q for the first and third quarters. Form N-CSR shows holdings for Q2 and Q4. The filings are on the SEC's EDGAR [website](http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml).


Investors should check on the number of sponsors as well as their quality. Tools in the print edition of IBD and online at Investors.com can help you find stocks with high-quality institutional sponsorship. [Your Weekly Review](http://news.investors.com/investing/your-weekly-review.htm) each Friday shows a top-rated mutual fund with a big investment for each of the stocks.


The monthly mutual fund special is another good place to see what top funds are buying. IBD's March 5, 2013, edition noted top managers buying **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)). Both stocks more than doubled that year.


**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) was another top buy. It also more than doubled in what was a solid year for the market.


In IBD [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) on Investors.com, you can find the latest quarterly percentage change in the number of mutual and hedge funds owning a stock. It also shows the number of quarters of increasing fund ownership.


IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating covers roughly 13 weeks' worth of action. It gives you a sense of the strength of institutional demand. An A or B signals solid buys.

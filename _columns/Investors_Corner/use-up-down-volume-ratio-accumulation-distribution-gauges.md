  How To Invest: Up-Down Volume Ratio Tracks Big Demand

"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain," were the famous words of the Wizard of Oz, the unremarkable-looking character in the film of the same name, who quietly orchestrated all the comings and goings in the Emerald City.


Institutional investors are the stock market's rough equivalent: They're quietly gathering large quantities of their targeted stocks, determining chart patterns and tightening floats until the imbalance of supply and demand squeezes a stock into a breakout and, if all goes well, a winning run.


IBD provides two specific tools to help glimpse behind the curtain and gauge institutional activity. These are most useful when a stock is basing and near a buy point.


The up/down volume ratio helps gauge whether or not a stock is under accumulation, a state in which the supply of shares is contracting due to rising demand. This indicates large institutions are at work buying the stock. IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is another tool to help gauge such supply and demand.


The up/down gauge covers 50 days of action. It's calculated by dividing total volume on days a stock's price ended higher by the total volume on days when it closed lower. The ratio should generally be above 1.0 in a stock that is about to break out.


You can see the up/down volume ratio at IBD Stock Checkup on investors.com and on Leaderboard.


Use the Accumulation/Distribution Rating as a corroborating indicator. You'd like to see a grade of C+ or better in a stock approaching a buy point. An A or B? Even better.


Both indicators were on target when **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) started its 525% advance in September 2009.


The stock had built a flattish cup-with-handle base. Tight weekly closes and closes high in the range through the second half of the base suggested accumulation. **1** So did the skyscrapers of buying volume across the bottom of the base. **2**


In the week just prior to Ulta's breakout, its EPS and RS Ratings were both an 86 â€” not stellar, but still solid. But its Accumulation/Distribution Grade was an A.


Its up/down volume ratio showed a potent 1.9 and had climbed above 2.0 in five of the eight previous weeks.


Ulta broke out Sept. 4 in huge volume. **3** Investors who missed that day's gap-up eruption would have needed to wait two months for another buy opportunity, until the stock pulled back to test support at its 10-week moving average. **4**

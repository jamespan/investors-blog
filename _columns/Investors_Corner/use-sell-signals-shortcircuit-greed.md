  What GoPro Stock Teaches About Greed and Sell Signals

Greed and hope are strange cousins. Smart investors work to navigate between the two emotions.


You can recognize greed by the voice that, when a stock is sending sell signals, says, "Wait, this might be the one, the one that makes your year, maybe your entire retirement."


Heeding that voice is one way to learn about hope. Hope is where you often end up when you ignore your sell rules, follow a stock cycling from gains into losses, then find yourself in the position of having to wait and pray for the injured stock to revive.


It's a bad place to be in the stock market.


One primary purpose of IBD's sell rules is to keep investors in positive territory, where they can use reason to manage their holdings. Staying there occasionally means being shaken out of some stocks you would like to have held. But more often than not, it will mean preserving capital and keeping cash free to apply to stocks clocking fresh gains rather than ones festering in indefinite corrections.


One healthy recent exercise in such discipline was **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)), which [went public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) last year on June 26. In an age obsessed with live video, the wearable digital-camera maker is clearly selling shovels during a gold rush. Recognizing this fact, investors drove the stock up out of a seven-week IPO base in August past a 50 buy point.


By the second week of October, shares were 310% above their initial offering price of 24. The hot potato then cooled, pulling back to its 10-week moving average (please see a weekly chart).


The pullback was generally mild. It did, however, include a hair-raising drop of 10% on Oct. 13 **(1)**, after media reports linked a GoPro camera with injuries suffered by Formula 1 racing legend Michael Schumacher in a skiing accident.


Shares then fell 18% in two days, Oct. 24 and 27 **(2)**, after Oppenheimer initiated coverage with an underperform rating. The rating sent the stock below its 50-day moving average. But trade was light, and most investors had big cushions in the stock, so alarm bells rang only quietly.


The stock retook and held the line of support for nearly a month, a good sign. Its next foray below support was a 9% tumble on Nov. 20 **(3)**, after the company priced a 10.4 million-share follow-on offering 5% below the prior session's closing price.


This high-volume stumble was a clear sell signal. The stock had been holding support. Institutional-grade selling helped drive it back below the line.


At the end of the week, investors who bought at the buy point still had a 41% gain. That's a pretty nice gain to cash out on.


For those who opted to hold, the next sell sign came Dec. 1 **(4)**, just after the stock tried and failed to retake its 50-day line. The line had become resistance. Shares fell 6% in light trade after the failed attempt.


It was a tough call, particularly for those who believe in the technology and the brand. The general market was in an uptrend. The holiday sales season was underway.


But holding meant hoping. And those for whom greed won out over the sell rules now find the stock a mere 1% above its initial 50 buy point.

If you are a new IBD reader, take the Relative Price Strength Rating to heart. In the rough-and-tumble stock market, the RS Rating can be your trustworthy friend. Just make sure to use it correctly. (More on that later.)

So, what is the RS Rating and how should you use it?

IBD takes every stock in its database and compares each one's price performance over the past 12 months. The lowest RS Rating is a 1, the highest 99. The RS Rating measures only price action, not volume changes.

The higher the RS Rating, the better. So if a stock's RS Rating is 80, that stock has done better than 80% of all other stocks in the IBD database. An 80 is a decent score. IBD's "20 Rules For Your Investment Success" says to look for stock with at least an 85 RS.

That said, should you simply buy stocks with 99 ratings and then take that six-week yachting vacation? Nope. You must use the RS Rating in conjunction with IBD's other ratings.

In Monday's Investor's Corner, IBD highlighted the EPS Rating. If the EPS Rating is the ribeye steak on the investor's plate, think of the RS Rating as the baked potato (or gourmet-style macaroni and cheese, for you foodies out there). You really don't have a satisfying meal without both.

That's not all. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is key to determining if the stock is seeing heavy volume as it is rising.

A stock may have a superb EPS Rating, yet the stock itself may not move higher. Maybe the stock has already peaked and has a lot more room for price downside. That's how the RS Rating can give you clarity.

The average RS Rating among stocks before they break out to new highs and make marvelous price runs is 87. Remember, that's an average. If a stock has built a base that's 10 to 12 months long, expect its RS Rating to be low â€” even down in the 50s to 70s. When **Canadian Natural Resources** ([CNQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNQ)), a member of the IBD Big Cap 20, cleared a long base at 34.02 on Feb. 6, the RS Rating was a 71.

The accompanying table offers a sample of companies, both small and large cap, that feature excellent RS Ratings and are contributing to the current market uptrend.

Don't confuse the RS Rating with the relative strength line. The latter graphs a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 only. If that RS line is rising, the stock is beating the market.

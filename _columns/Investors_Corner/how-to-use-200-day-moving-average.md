  200-Day Line Can Sometimes Offer Support

Just as a hiker on a long uphill trek needs to stop to rest occasionally, a stock needs to rest during a long advance. Savvy investors look for spots where an advancing stock can find support. The [50-day moving average](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/752650-the-50-day-line-is-a-versatile-indicator.htm) is often that spot. A stock retraces part of an advance, preferably in light volume, then bounces off the line. Not every stock obeys its 50-day line, but it often works because institutional investors see such a pullback as an opportunity to add shares. Individual investors can do the same.

  

As you watch the 50-day moving average on a daily chart, don't forget about the 200-day line.

  

This line is less frequently used as a support area for a fast-moving stock. Most stocks that are rallying sharply are well above the line. Yet the 200-day moving average can help you decide when to exit a long-term winner.

  

Let's step back and define what we mean by the moving average lines. In the 200-day line, each day you add the closing price for all of the past 200 trading sessions, then divide by 200 to get an average. Many chart services, including IBD and its sister company, [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com) , have 50-day and 200-day lines built in.

  

Some investors use other lines, such as the 10-day line, to time short-term trades.

  

One way to use the 200-day line is as a sell signal if the stock is 70% to 100% above the line. But IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil writes in "How to Make Money in Stocks" that he has seldom used that signal. You should probably use it only when other sell signals confirm it.

  

But there are instances in which you can use it as a support line. Take **Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) in its run-up to a 2006 top.

  

Brazil-based Gol was a discounter in the mold of **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)). Its fares were cheap enough to get budget travelers off buses and cars. Despite rising fuel prices, which pinched all airlines, Gol managed to grow market share from 4.7% when it started in 2001 to 45% by 2007.

  

Gol's earnings soared 148%, 58% and 80% between 2004 and 2006.

  

The stock [went public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in June 2004, built an IPO base, moved up and eventually formed another base. It cleared a double bottom with handle on Nov. 1, 2005.

  

It was a solid breakout. The stock moved up more than 20% in three weeks, which means that investors should have held it at least eight weeks to see if it should be a long-term hold.

  

Gol rose until May 2006. Before the breakout, the stock had found support at its 40-week moving average **(1)**, a weekly chart's equivalent to the 200-day line on a daily chart. After a big move up, Gol moved sideways and found support again **(2)**.

  

After Gol broke down and fell below the line **(3)** in October 2006, the 40-week moving average turned into an area of upside resistance. That's a good sell signal.

  

In 2007, Gol acquired the assets of bankrupt Varig Airlines. A year later, Gol reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, "The launch and integration of Varig's operations, however, has in 2007 and may, in the near term, result in lower profitability."

  

Profitability plummeted, and so did the stock price. It now trades below 3.

The flat base has much in common with its cousin, the square-box base. But there are differences, and a little confusion could get you in trouble.

Be assured, both patterns can portend big advances. The theme they share is tight trading. And as you may have learned by now, tight is right when it comes to buying stocks.

Narrow, tense ranges mean big funds are placing their friendly hands just beneath the market. They aren't chasing the stock higher â€” not yet, anyway.

**The Flat Base**

First, let's examine the flat base. The pattern must run for at least five weeks. The first week must show a net decline compared with the prior week.

The maximum range for the base must not exceed 15%.

The action within the flat base should be as sideways as possible. Volume should be low, as if the stock is setting up while nobody is paying any attention.

A breakout would appear when the stock moves to new highs. Like any breakout, a push from a flat base should be accompanied by a solid volume surge, at least 40% from its average pace of business.

**The Square Box**

Like the flat base, a square box must not stray more than 15%, from top to bottom. Sideways action is preferred to an upward or downward tilt. Volume should be quiet.

The big difference is the pattern's time span. Instead of five weeks, a square box needs just four. It can last up to seven weeks. This helps give the pattern a sharply angled, boxy look.

If you're looking at what you think is a flat base in the making, look closer.

Does the pattern look like your first apartment? It should look like, well, a square box. It may look as long as it is high.

If the pattern has four weeks under its belt, and you're sitting there waiting for Week 5, the stock can easily take off without you.

Software development outsourcer **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) built a square-box base in October and November 2010 **1**.

The span from top to bottom runs 12% deep. Perfect.

Volume was not as low as you'd ideally want to see, especially in Week 2 **2**. This indicates that institutional investors were selling shares at the time. But turnover did quiet down a bit later.

To some eyes, the pattern has a cuppish look; but at under six weeks, it was not long enough to qualify as a cup-without-handle base.

Cognizant broke out in the week ended Dec. 3 **3** and has moved steadily higher since rising past a 68.97 buy point.

Tighter is better.

You know it by looking at the chart. It's more attractive. If a stock's gyrations are so wide as to almost mask a breakout, it simply looks wrong.

In fact, there's more to this than just aesthetics. Tighter doesn't just look better; it really is better.

Consider the factors at work with a tightly traded stock vs. a loose, sloppy pattern.

With tight trading, you know that big-money institutions are holding out their friendly hands, palms up, just below a stock.

This can go on for days, weeks or even months. They're saying: "We want this stock. If you have some for sale, we'll buy it."

Such passive buying is often the last stage before a run-up. For the moment, those friendly hands are steady. They aren't bidding up the stock — yet.

At some point, if there's something special about that stock, it will rise. The big, friendly hands will have amassed some quantity at what will soon look like bargain prices. That's when the bidding gets aggressive.

Consider **Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)), a top maker of phosphate fertilizers. The four-month cup with handle it formed from May to September of 2006 showed plenty of areas of tight weekly action, like in June when it closed at 28.26 for two weeks in row **1** (prices reflect a 3-for-1 split in late May 2007). Potash built a firm handle that fell just 6% from its high of 33.38 to a low of 31.52 **2**.

So, what about a sloppy-looking stock? Some selling comes into play — and there are few friendly hands to support it.

The stock usually falls sharply until bargain hunters step in. The stock may turn around and lurch higher. But if it isn't ready to make a serious move, that lurch will be short-lived.

What happens? The stock falls, until it again wins the attention of bargain hunters. On a chart, this behavior appears loose and sloppy.

Consider some of the most successful chart patterns that require tight trading: the flat base and its cousin, the square box.

The maximum decline permitted in either pattern is just 15%. That's not much over a period of at least four or five weeks. But it's that hard-to-achieve narrow trading that makes these bases the powerful coils that can yield strong gains.

The three-weeks-tight add-on pattern is another case where tight trading is an omen for future gains. Each weekly close must not be more than 1% above or below the prior week. Tight trading is also the key ingredient to the high, tight flag, a rare base. The pattern starts with a fast advance, at least 100%, in just four to eight weeks. It then corrects no more than 20% to 25% over the next three to five weeks.

Remember: There's no such thing as a sound high, sloppy flag or a three-weeks-loose pattern.

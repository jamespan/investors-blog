There's no reason to take profits in an emerging leader when the stock shows accumulation and breaks out from an [early-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). But after big runs and a series of breakouts, leaders in an industry group invariably start to show signs of wear and tear, mostly due to persistent signs of institutional selling.




At some point, savvy fund managers and big investors cash out and rotate into other areas of the market. Recognizing when this happens helps you decide when to sell stocks. This is key to locking in profits in a big winner.


The homebuilder group built sturdy profits for stock pickers when a multiyear bull market kicked into gear in March 2003. Homebuilders started breaking out from early-stage bases in May — two months after the Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend on March 17, rising 4% in strong volume.


After a two-year-plus price run, a wave of institutional selling hit the homebuilder group in the summer and fall of 2005, marking the start of a lengthy downtrend for the group.

Several top performers in the group broke out from [late-stage bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) at the time. **Pulte** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) cleared a [fourth-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/) in June 2005 (monthly chart is shown below) but institutional selling started to hit the stock a few months later **(1)**.


The stock tried to form a new base but failed. By January 2008, Pulte fell 83% from its 48.22 peak.


When To Sell Stocks: The Homebuilder Case Study

![icphm_110216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ICphm_110216-1024x653.png)Ryland Group, which got acquired by CalAtlantic tried to clear a [fifth-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/) in June the same year, but it suffered the same plight as Pulte. (**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) in turn bought CalAtlantic in February 2018.)


See how the stocks began falling well ahead of signs that the housing market was headed toward a nationwide crisis?


Fast forward to 2012 and 2013, and homebuilders regrouped to hold a bona fide leadership role in the market again.


If you bought Ryland when the shares cleared a first-stage base in late April 2012 and held on for the ride, congratulations.



By May 2013, Ryland reached as high as 50.42, up 137% from the April 2012 breakout price of 21.25. Ryland soon peaked and went into hibernation for nearly two years.


*A version of this column was originally published in the May 21, 2013, edition of IBD. In October 2015, Ryland Group merged with Standard Pacific to become CalAtlantic Group. Lennar completed its buy of CalAtlantic in February 2018. Follow Shreve on Twitter at [@IBD\_KShreve](https://twitter.com/IBD_KShreve) for more commentary on stocks and financial markets.*

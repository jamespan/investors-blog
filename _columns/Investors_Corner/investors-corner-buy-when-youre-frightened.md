  Investor's Corner: Buy When You're Frightened

The stock market works much differently than the natural world does.

  

When an animal is scared, its first reaction is to freeze. Naturalists say that freezing helps animals escape the attention of predators that hunt by sensing movement.

  

Try that trick in the stock market — freezing when you should be taking action — and you'll either be knocked silly by the bears or left behind by the bulls.

  

Unfortunately, instincts that were useful in prehistoric days are counterproductive in the world of investing. The instinct to freeze also isn't much use when facing modern threats.

  

How is it then that well-trained martial artists, elite police officers and special forces soldiers will react decisively to a threat while the ordinary person freezes? Often you will hear the elite say after a crisis that their "training took over."

  

Training enables the elite performer to react properly, despite their natural instincts.

  

The well-trained investor shares this same trait. It's natural near the end of a bear market to be too afraid to buy stocks. But the well-trained investor — taking advantage of past experience and relying on self-discipline to curb harmful impulses — will act on a follow-through day.

  

A follow-through day always arrives after a significant market correction. It involves a big gain in a major index on the fourth day or later of an attempted rally. This device will get the investor back in the market when those who rely on their instincts will be too afraid to move.

  

Greed is a similar story. In nature, the continual stockpiling of nuts might create security for squirrels. But when a stock piles up too many gains, there's no security.

  

The greedy investor who tries to squeeze the last dollar out of a price run is courting trouble. The rookie, who becomes ecstatic as his or her stock notches big gains, also is headed for a wake-up call.

  

Well-trained investors know that the average, historical big market winner rarely makes any progress past a late-stage base. They also know that the third year of a bull market is seldom as generous as the first year of a bull market. Most of all, they realize that big gains should inspire caution, not optimism.

  

Reality tempers their expectations. Or as the financier Bernard Baruch said, "I made my money by selling too soon."

  

Baruch added this piece of advice: "Don't try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. It can't be done except by liars."

  

Here's the interesting thing about our natural instincts vs. experience: Over time, training will change the investor's emotional makeup. He or she will be wary under conditions that make the inexperienced investor exuberant. And he or she will be confident when the rookie is most fearful.

  

Studying your past trades and a willingness to learn from past mistakes will speed the pace of your training in emotional mastery.

*Second In A Series*

  

Everyone wants a magic indicator that perfectly spots tops and bottoms. There really is no such thing.

  

Psychological market indicators shouldn't be your main tools for timing the market. Instead, let price and volume be your guide.

  

As IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How To Make Money In Stocks," "The stock market is human nature and crowd psychology on daily display." This parade is showcased in price and volume bars on charts, which are really all you need.

  

Instead of seeking a Holy Grail indicator, focus on follow-throughs to signal possible market bottoms. For market tops, watch out for a cluster of distribution days in a short period of time, as well as topping signs by leading stocks.

  

Still, sentiment indicators can help you understand crowd psychology. These measures are contrarian indicators, meaning that when the herd is facing one way, the market is likely ready to go the opposite direction.

  

Psychological indicators can give false readings, though. Just because one gives a bullish signal doesn't mean the market is going to turn on a dime. A psychological indicator can stay in bullish territory for some time, while the market continues falling. And vice versa.

  

Some indicators work well, then fall out of favor.

  

A number of psychological market indicators can be found on the How's The Market? page, today on B2. The Investors Intelligence Bulls vs. Bears weekly survey measures sentiment among newsletter writers and advisers. The idea behind it is that the market is near a top when a large number of advisers are bullish. In recent years, it's proved more useful as a signal that a bottom is near when bearish advisers exceed bulls.

  

Two weeks before the Nasdaq topped in late October 2007 **1**, 62% of investment advisers were bullish vs. 20% for the bear camp, showing excessive optimism. By the time the Nasdaq topped Oct. 31, 2007, there were five distribution days. By March, the Nasdaq had tumbled 25% **2**.

  

Another popular sentiment gauge is the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility index, or VIX. It's widely used as a fear gauge. When the VIX is high, there's a high level of fear and the market could be near a low. A low VIX reading shows complacency, which means the market may be due for a correction.

  

The put-call volume ratio is also a well-known psychological indicator. When the ratio surged to 1.4 in early August, signifying 140 bearish puts traded for every 100 bullish calls, the market was in the thick of its slide. The high level of bearish sentiment hinted a bottom was near.

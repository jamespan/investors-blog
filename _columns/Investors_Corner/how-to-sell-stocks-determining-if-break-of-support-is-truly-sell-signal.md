In the past, Investor's Corner has discussed [using the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) to add to a winning position or to mark a sell signal. How to sell stocks is crucial too.


The stock market weakness this year has probably forced you into selling at least some of your stocks. If the 10-week line brought you into this world, it can also take you out of it.


Don't automatically set your stop orders right at the 10-week average. You want to see a decisive break below the 10-week moving average.




If it's not obvious from looking at the stock chart, try this guideline: A decisive break is when the stock [closes the week 2% or more below the 10-week line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KdkdyhYI4I). If your stock begins to dive midweek, you will want to sit tight until Friday afternoon before making a decision. 


Open a weekly chart on [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). Click and hold on any bar to bring up the price information. At the bottom of the data display, you will see the 10-week moving average as well as what percentage away from it the current price is. This will make Friday's decision to keep or sell quick and easy.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IC2c_052322-300x161.jpg)In April 2020, **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) **(1)**. The 10-week line supported the stock's run until September of that year. On Sept. 4, the stock slid as much as 10% below the 10-week line **(2)**. However if you didn't panic, stuck to the rules and held until that Friday's final hour, you could have saved yourself 7% of that loss before closing your position. The stock closed nearly 3% below the 10-week average, and at that point could be considered a clear break of the line.


How To Sell Stocks: Shopify's Later Signals
-------------------------------------------


A 60% profit from the April 2020 breakout kept Shopify on our radar during 2021 as [our market outlook](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/) oscillated between "confirmed uptrend" and "uptrend under pressure." 


There were still gains to be had, though on much smaller scales than before. Breakouts from late-stage bases in December 2020 and June 2021 ultimately failed but the 10-week line would have given you sell signals before you faced an [automatic 7%-8% stop loss](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


In the week ended Dec. 3, 2021, IBD's outlook had moved to "market in correction" — something akin to our [recommended market exposure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now) of 0%-10% — and Shopify closed 5.5% below the 10-week line with high volume. This was the beginning of the stock's dramatic plunge below 350. 


Pullbacks and shakeouts can be frustrating when you're holding a position. But in the worst-case scenario, if you get shaken out you can buy back at a safer, albeit higher, price. But ignoring this decisive 10-week rule and holding a position below the 10-week, you risk a stock wiping out your portfolio.

The start of a major uptrend may be tough to identify for folks who want to learn how to trade growth stocks with success — and especially so if you are relying solely on headlines and news. By the time the media figures out what's going on in the stock market, the best part is over.




IBD's method of determining an upturn in the market doesn't rely on personal judgment.


It relies on a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), a device identified by historical research. The follow-through day requires a set of converging factors.


How does it work?


Start With The 1st Up Day After A Significant Price Correction
--------------------------------------------------------------


The investor first looks for an attempted rally. Day 1 of an attempted rally begins when a major index closes up from the previous session. Neither volume nor the size of the gain matters. The only thing that matters is that the attempted rally stays alive.


For the attempted rally to stay alive, the low cannot be undercut.


On Day 4 or later of the attempted rally, at least one of the key market indexes must deliver a strong gain in volume up from the previous day. That big gain in rising volume is the follow-through day, which confirms that a new uptrend is underway. [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), published every day within the "Market Trend" section of Investors.com, will provide color and analysis when any follow-through day occurs.


A follow-through day can't pick the exact day that a market bottoms, but it can get you in close to the bottom.


Go back in history, and you will find a follow-through day early in every major market uptrend.


Teddy's Bear Market And Bull Market
-----------------------------------


In September 1901, Teddy Roosevelt became president after the assassination of President William McKinley.


Roosevelt's words and actions soon frightened businesses. His administration launched the first of many antitrust suits in February 1902. And in August of that year, Roosevelt gave a speech in which he asserted that corporations were "creatures of the state" and that the government has "the right to control them."

The next month, the U.S. economy fell into a recession.


The stock market had been falling for four months when the recession started. By November 1903, the Dow Jones industrial average marked a low that was 40% lower than it was the day Roosevelt took office.


Bad times always end, and the stock market often anticipates the end. The recession ended in August 1904 **(1)**. However, the follow-through day, signaling a new uptrend, came on Dec. 2, 1903 **(2)** — Day 16 of an attempted rally.


Volume grew that day and for the week. The Dow rose 59% in the next 12 months.


Big Growth Stocks In 2019 Have Benefited From This
--------------------------------------------------


The latest follow-through to occur?


On Jan. 4, 2019, the S&P 500 rallied more than 3% on the seventh day of a new uptrend attempt. [Follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/)!


Volume on the NYSE increased sharply vs. the prior session. After the close, IBD published the [Jan. 4 Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/) to detail this potential new change in market trend.



Since that day's close at 2531, the 500 has gained more than 19% before staging its latest price correction. Plus, in recent months numerous high-growth stocks in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and other lists have [broken out of bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and achieved even stronger gains.


One example: **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)), a new innovator in software and network security, which joined the [Leaders Near A Buy Point at Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on March 1. Just days before, the new IPO rallied past a 48.34 buy point in an early stage base. The stock made a superb short-term gain through its July peak at 89.54, up as much as 85% in less than five months.


Now the stock is deep in the middle of a new [base-building phase](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


In more recent months, highly rated stocks in the retail, medical, construction and REIT sectors have taken the leadership mantle.

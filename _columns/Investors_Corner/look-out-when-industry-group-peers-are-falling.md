You'd think a leading stock should be able to hold up even if others in its industry group are flailing.

But just as a stock can get a lift from big moves by others in its industry group, they can also undergo a sympathy move when peers are sinking. So keep an eye on what is going on within the group as well.

"Grouping and tracking stocks by industry group can also help get you out of weakening investments faster," IBD founder and chairman Bill O'Neil said in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "If, after a successful run, one or two important stocks in a group breaks seriously, the weakness may sooner or later 'wash over' into the remaining stocks in that field."

Add this fact to your arsenal of sell rules. Rarely will a stock keep advancing if most of its peers aren't.

Nearly half of a great stock's move is predicated on its industry group and sector's strength. Yet there can be a variety of reasons for a group's move south, including sector rotation within the market, industry-related news and a general correction.

Take the financials in 2007 and '08, when the subprime mortgage crisis and the U.S. economic recession came to a head. Once the big investment banks began to crack in late 2007, the weakness spread to the rest of the sector. By the time the slump ended, only a few major U.S. investment banks were left standing, including **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)). Both turned into commercial banks, which are subject to stricter regulation. Lehman Bros. went bankrupt. Bear Stearns was sold to **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)). **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) scooped up Merrill Lynch.

Another group, the private educators, benefited from the overall economic weakness and collapse in the financial sector as people returned to school to pursue a new career path or upgrade their skills.

**Grand Canyon Education** ([LOPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOPE)) even came public in November 2008, at 12 a share. It rose as much as 137% by mid-April 2010. But the good times didn't last long.

That month, the for-profit school group got hit after an Education Department official said more regulation was needed in the industry. It wasn't the first time the group had been scrutinized.

**Career Education** ([CECO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CECO)) went on a massive run from its 1998 debut to its April 2004 peak. But the stock headed south between 2004 and 2006 as the company faced probes and lawsuits alleging it misrepresented its programs to consumers. It spent the next few years turning itself around with new management and other changes.

The stock advanced from 2008 to 2010. But peers including **Apollo Education Group** ([APOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APOL)) and **Corinthian Colleges** ([COCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COCO)) had already begun to slide in early 2009.

Career Education hung in there, even breaking out from a base in March 2010 and rising 24% over the next month and a half **(1)** . But the peer pressure began to take its toll. After failing to break out from a series of bases **(2)** in August 2011, the stock finally caved in and entered a steep descent.

Career Education crashed through its 10-week moving average, a key sell signal, then spiraled down to its April 2013 bottom of 2.03. Today the stock is still trading in the mid-single digits. Even Grand Canyon, which remains one of the sector's better players, slid from April 2010 to May 2011.

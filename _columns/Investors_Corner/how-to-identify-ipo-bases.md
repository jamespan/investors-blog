Plenty of enthusiasm often surrounds a hot new company when it goes public. And while it's tempting to try to buy shares of such an [initial public offering](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) right out of the gate, waiting until the stock consolidates and breaks out of its first base is a prudent strategy.


Like any other stock, new issues need time to consolidate before setting up for a potential run. Few if any stocks can sustain big gains over the long term without pausing to digest them. So even if an IPO rockets higher from the get-go, it will at some point take a breather.


The key difference is length. An IPO base doesn't necessarily need to form over the five- or seven-week minimum that more mature stocks require for a flat or cup-with-handle base, respectively.


IPO bases can sometimes form quickly and as a result are easy to miss. Also, IPO bases can be volatile or otherwise lack the proper traits of a normal base.


It's a good idea to study a newly public company's stock chart to find the stock's proper buy point, because these young players have the potential to provide early shareholders with outsize gains.


The [IPO Leaders column](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), published in IBD on Tuesdays and Thursdays, aims to alert readers to promising companies that have recently gone public.


**YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) debuted in November 2012 at 10.50 a share, traded tightly for two more sessions, then surged 25% the next week. Intrigued investors keeping an eye on the new issue would have seen the stock pull back as it paused to digest the gain and form the left side of an IPO base.


The base was long enough, unlike most IPO patterns. But it did not have a conventional shape. A sharp sell-off characterized the first week, followed by more volatility as the stock recovered sharply.


YY shares settled down after that, forming a smooth bottom with much tighter price action. Shares cleared the 15.37 buy point of the 10-week consolidation on Feb. 24 in volume 72% higher than usual **(1)**, well above the 40% minimum that you'd like to see at a breakout.


At the time, the Chinese social media stock was too thinly traded to show up in IBD columns such as the IBD 50, Research Table Review or Stock Spotlight.


But investors perusing the top five sectors in IBD's stock research tables might have noted that the new issue's name showed up in boldface type the day of its breakout, which means that it marked a new high in strong volume.


The table also showed that YY had earned sound fundamentals, including the following ratings: 87 Relative Price Strength, 80 Earnings Per Share and 77 Composite. YY's Internet content industry group ranked No. 56, up from No. 111 three weeks prior.


Those who missed the IPO base would soon get another chance to buy. After advancing 36% from that first breakout, the stock pulled back again to start setting up a new pattern.


YY began appearing in IBD articles as the stock and its industry group continued to improve. It broke out past a 20.99 cup-base buy point on May 6, 2013, in the biggest volume since its IPO **(2)** .


From there, YY rallied more than 430% to its March 2014 high.

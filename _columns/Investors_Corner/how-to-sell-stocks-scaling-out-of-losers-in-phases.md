How to sell stocks is just as important as knowing how to buy them. We don't want to leave our losses up to chance. Therefore, we must have definite sell signals we can use when a trade sours and our emotions flare up.

There are three strategic places at which you may want to cut your losses. Having and sticking to your plan, especially when it comes to preventing losses, is key to successful investing. Each of these lines in the sand will help you protect your well-earned capital.

Say you made your initial purchase from a cup base, but soon shares begin to reverse lower. A small profit is now a loss. Don't panic. Instead, here are the three stages for selling a stock that's not rising from its breakout.

## **Sell Rule No. 1: Stock C**loses Below Breakout Day Low\*\*\*\*

The first is selling one-third of your position as the stock undercuts and closes below the [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) day's low. This is the first line in the sand.

If shortly after the breakout attempt the stock undercuts that low and closes below it, consider taking off 33% of your initial position.

## **Sell Rule No. 2: Stock C**loses Below Day Zero Low\*\*\*\*

The second sell signal comes if the stock closes below the low of the day before the breakout. This is something we can call Day Zero. If shares close below this low, it's a good idea to take off another third of your position.

## **Sell Rule No. 3: Stock Is 5%-8% Below The Buy Point**

The final sell signal and the one that's been discussed many times on ["IBD Live"](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/) is selling as the stock moves 5% to 8% below that initial [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-point-rule-how-teslas-34-gain-could-have-turned-to-43-profit/). Here, we must leave our emotions out of it and follow this capital-saving rule.

This is a variation of [IBD's 7% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), which is the standard loss-cutting tactic. With the new approach, circumstances may determine at what percentage-loss you sell. For example, you may cut losses earlier (5%) in a weak market.

Though it's always tough to sell for a loss and admit you were wrong, this final hard line in the sand prevents us from suffering a devastating decline that's too steep to recover from.

## Sell Rules In Action: Haliburton Stock

**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IC111323-279x300.jpg)Haliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) broke out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 42.60 buy point on June 8, 2022 **(1)**.

The next day, shares fell and closed below the low of the breakout day, triggering the first sell phase **(2)**. Here, it would have been ideal to take off one third of your initial position.

The very next day, shares closed below Day Zero (the day before shares broke out) **(3)**. This triggered the second phase, and another third of the position should be sold.

The third and final sell signal came the following day, when shares exceeded a 5%-8% decline from the 42.60 entry **(4)**. This day served as a double whammy because shares also closed below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).

On top of that, the stock declined in heavier-than-normal volume that day. This clearly marked the failure of the breakout. The stock cut right through those areas of support and didn't bottom out until September 2022 at 23.30.

Investors who finally sold at this level accrued far greater losses than those savvier players who sold at various points along the way down.

Note: Sell rules No. 1 and No. 2 were originally developed by former IBD Head Market Strategist Mike Webster.

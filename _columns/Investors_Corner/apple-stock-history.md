For many investors, the true romance with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) didn't begin until April 2003, when the stock was a split-adjusted 0.908. Anyone who invested \$6,797 at that low, and held the stock 12 years, reached \$1 million at the stock's February high this year.

Of course, no one knew to do that.

Over its entire stock history (1980 to the present), Apple took more turns than a soap opera star.

In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded the company. In 1980, Apple's [initial public offering](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) took place on the Nasdaq. The company, though, struggled and in 1985, Jobs was forced out. One tech writer predicted on Jobs' exit that he was writing his "last Steve Jobs column" and that Jobs would "go the way of the pet rock."

As old, grumpy newspapermen used to say, "Don't make predictions. That's why they play the game â€” to find out who wins." That quaint notion isn't heard anymore, except in a different form from IBD founder William O'Neil. "We don't want to give personal opinions or predictions; we carefully observe market supply and demand as it changes day by day," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

The key words are "carefully observe."

Careful observation serves investors much better than predictions do.

In 1996, Jobs returned to Apple and within a few years, new and successful products appeared.

Before the new products' afterburners kicked in, some market watchers said that Apple wouldn't survive. In 1997, Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Computer, said this to a question about Apple: "What would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders."

Apple was declared dead more often than highbrow literary critics have declared, "The novel is dead." In both cases, the joke turned out to be on the critics. (Apple and the novel are just fine, but quite a few of the critics are dead.)

All the news that surrounded Apple over the years makes people forget the early opportunities in the stock.

Individual investors made good profits during the stock's various runs before Apple became a superstar. And Apple's IPO offers a useful lesson. What can investors learn from Apple's 1980 IPO?

Apple shares began in a way that is sometimes seen among high-profile growth stocks: A quick burst up followed by a long decline. Sometimes the burst lasts only a day, or a week or two. Often the early decline occurs among stocks that perhaps received too much media hype: **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) are recent examples.

In December 1980, Apple debuted and jumped 30% in two weeks **(1)**. IBD-style investors, though, don't buy new issues before at least a small base forms.

After the two-week rally, Apple corrected 39%. The stock eventually formed a beautiful cup with handle **(2)** but never cleared the handle. (It illustrates why investors should wait for a breakout. Even if a stock forms a handle, that doesn't mean it will clear it.)

A deeper correction followed **(3)**.

Apple's first valid entry didn't develop until January 1983. The stock broke out and advanced 39% before retreating to shape a new base. An April 1983 breakout from the base led to a 30% gain.

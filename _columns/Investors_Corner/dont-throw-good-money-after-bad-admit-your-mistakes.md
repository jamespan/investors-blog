So you finally bought shares of that company you've been eyeing. It met your fundamental and technical criteria, and it cleared a base during a confirmed market uptrend.

But wait a sec. It's heading south instead of north. Well, you might think, it's barely below your buy point and will likely recover soon. In fact, if you double down, you could make a bigger profit when it turns around.

Sound familiar?

Let's face it: No one likes to admit they made a mistake. But averaging down is a form of denial â€” and a way to rationalize why you bought the stock in the first place. That can lead an investor to throw good money after bad.

All investors have a lapse in judgment from time to time. Your best course of action is to own up to your mistakes and cut your losses short. If you follow strict buy and sell rules, you should be able to avoid a catastrophic loss.

Take **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)). The yoga apparel maker's stock was seemingly unstoppable as it soared more than 3,700% from its 2009 lows to its June 2013 peak. But it had shown signs of fatigue along the way. Its base count was at five by the time it began consolidating in May 2012. Late-stage bases are much riskier than earlier ones.

Still, you may have been tempted to buy when the stock cleared a 78.06 buy point the week ended May 10, 2013. The market was still in a confirmed uptrend.

The stock displayed some red flags, however. The breakout occurred in lackluster volume **(1)**. The stock also couldn't gain traction over the next four weeks. Perhaps some were tempted to buy more as it dipped below the entry.

Shares dived 19% the week ended June 14, slicing their 10-week moving average in the heaviest-ever weekly volume **(2)**, and well below the 8% sales trigger. The culprit? Quarterly earnings were flat, hurt by a recall of too-sheer Luon workout pants. Also, then-CEO Christine Day would step down as soon as a replacement was found.

Lulu appeared to find support around 60 and began edging higher the next four weeks. But it never regained its buy point and topped out at 77.75 before reversing lower. A 15% plunge in mid-December sent it well below 60 **(3)**. Investors who tried to average down in hopes of a recovery suffered a 20% gap-down the week ended Jan. 17 **(4)**. It's now down more than 40% from 77.75.

Breakouts don’t always work the way an investor would prefer.


Ideally, you want to see steady gains after a breakout. When a stock rolls over after a breakout, it’s easy to close the position and then forget about the “loser” stock.


Yet, sometimes a loser is a winner that just needs to foul off a few of the market’s pitches before connecting for a long drive.


The individual investor needs to stay awake and alert after an apparent failure. The stock could form a base-on-base pattern.


The base on base’s story runs like this: A stock creates and breaks out of a base. After rising modestly, the stock retreats and forms a second base on top of the first base.


The overall pattern might look like two ladles with the second hung a little higher than the first.


Often the lows of the second ladle are at or near the highs of the first.


A base-on-base pattern is often the depiction of a strong stock fighting weak market conditions. IBD founder William O’Neil describes it this way in “How to Make Money in Stocks”:


“What happens is that a powerful stock breaks out of its base and advances, but is unable to increase a normal 20% to 30% because the general market begins another leg down. The stock therefore pulls back in price and builds a second back-and-forth price consolidation area just on top of its previous base while the general market averages keep making new lows.


“When the bearish phase in the overall market ends ... this stock is apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain.”


On Sept. 3, 1999, **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) broke out in heavy volume (please see a daily chart). The buy point was 39.91 (before a pair of 2-for-1 splits taking place in 2000). The Composite Rating was 97. The industry group rating was A.


The market was doing well. On the same day as Oracle’s breakout, the Nasdaq surged 4% in heavier trade. But it didn’t last, and the Nasdaq delivered four distribution days over the next three weeks.


Oracle stumbled with the market. The tech stock also delivered quarterly results that only matched views. The Street was hoping for better. Oracle slipped.


The stock then shaped a base on base. The base showed positive characteristics. Trading was tight within the base **(1)**, a sign of support.


The Nasdaq began to climb Oct. 28. Oracle broke out the next session, surpassing a 47.04 entry point in heavy volume. The stock advanced 283% in five months, while the Nasdaq jumped about 75%.

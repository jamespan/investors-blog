Most brokers give customers surprisingly sophisticated online and mobile platforms to allow them to monitor the market.

  

All provide investors with a way to track their stocks with real-time streaming charts. They're tools that only a few years ago were the exclusive purview of professionals in Manhattan skyscrapers.

  

But should an investor continuously check intraday charts or have them running on their desks during the trading day?

  

There's a downside to that. It's too easy to react emotionally to a slight hiccup, which looks on a chart with 15-minute bars like an avalanche. It's more useful to focus on a daily chart or, even better, a weekly chart to gauge the magnitude of a move.

  

And it's often better to wait until the end of the week to see if the sell-off below the 10-week line is really cause for alarm.

  

Intraday charts have some benefits.

  

For advanced traders, they can help identify an early or alternate buy point. Sometimes, a stock ready to break out forms its own little base within a handle over a period of days. But a more reliable strategy is to draw trend lines on a daily or weekly chart to identify such an early entry point. (See articles in IBD University at Investors.com and the advanced buying strategies home study [course](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/advanced-buying-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=APA1BQ8) for examples.)

  

They are also helpful before the market opens and after it closes, if news, such as an earnings report or an analyst's comment, affects your stock while the market is closed.

  

Sometimes, it's hard to gauge how good or bad a news item or earnings report is by reading a press release, an analyst report, or by studying the numbers. What really matters is the market's reaction to it. You see that in the price and volume action after the news is out.

  

Keep in mind that sometimes the initial reaction isn't the one that matters in the days and weeks that follow.

  

The same is true for the market during a day when market-moving news occurs. That's usually the case when the Federal Reserve makes a pronouncement on monetary policy.

  

Viewed on an intraday chart, the indexes sometimes go wild when the Fed changes so much as a word in its statement. But the market's initial reaction often differs from the final one. The market may jump one way in a matter of minutes, then move even more strongly in the other direction before the day is done.

  

And the market's initial reaction might not be the one that counts over days and weeks ahead as money managers gauge the effect of evolving policy on their portfolios.

  

Take the example of **Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)), a fast-growing new issue in late 2002. On April 1, 2003, the stock broke out of a five-week flat base that corrected 13%. It was the stock's first base, making it a fine time to jump into a hot new issue.

  

But on April 14, a Monday morning, the stock opened down sharply. At one point it was down 7% from the day before and below the 23.80 buy point.

  

An investor watching intraday charts would have likely been panic-stricken and sold, probably close to the bottom.

  

The stock held at its 50-day line and recovered within hours. It managed a 5% gain on the day **(1)**. A retrospective look at the charts shows the April 14 action was nothing more than a useful shakeout.

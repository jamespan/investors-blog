If you want to know the most critical factor in picking growth stocks, it has to be this: earnings per share.




Why is that? Simplicity matters in the stock market, or as physicist Albert Einstein purportedly said, "If you can't explain it to a 6-year-old, you don't understand it yourself."


The quote wasn't in reference to the stock market and some people say it is apocryphal, but the principle applies. A 6-year-old child can be made to understand that if a lemonade stand has nothing left after paying all costs and selling all the product, that business will fail for lack of profits.


This basic truth is why IBD founder William O'Neil in "The Successful Investor" wrote, "Of all the factors that affect stock price, profitability is the most important. And earnings per share (EPS) is the way profitability is measured. They're calculated by dividing a company's total after-tax profits by the number of shares outstanding."

A study of history's best stocks from 1952 to 2001 found that "three out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the latest publicly reported quarter before they began their major advances," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


O'Neil continued, "You may find that only 2% of all stocks listed on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange will show earnings gains of this size. But remember: You're looking for stocks that are exceptional, not lackluster."


Earnings Per Share: 4 Facts
---------------------------


Here are four things to consider when gauging a stock's earnings:


**Don't settle for promises.** If a company is either losing or not making much money, company management and/or stock analysts will sometimes shift the attention away from earnings. A company might report strong sales without consistently converting that to profits.



For example, **Zoe's Kitchen** ([ZOES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZOES)) increased sales 46% to 59% in 2009 through 2013 while losing money each year. The company turned a profit in 2014-16 but then lost money in 2017. Since debuting as a NYSE initial public offering in 2014, the stock price scrambled 172% in 2014, then fell 6%, 14% and 30% in the next three years. So far this year, Zoe's is down 24%.


"There is absolutely no good reason for a stock to go anywhere in a big, sustainable way if its current earnings are poor," O'Neil observed in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Embrace Earnings Per Share, Not Investing Stories
-------------------------------------------------


**Don't fall in love with a stock that lacks earnings.** The mainstream news media love all things electric, which partly explains why electric car maker **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) wins so much attention. But how realistic is that love? In the past three years, Tesla lost \$5.39 a share, \$2.87 a share and last year \$8.66 a share.


The Street expects Tesla to lose \$5.49 a share this year.



**Ignore one-time earnings gains.** If a tech company sells some of its real estate, that profit should be stripped out of the results. You want to know how profitable the company is in its regular, recurring operations.


**Look for accelerating earnings growth.** For instance, if a company is growing quarterly earnings 10% and then steps up growth 20%, 35% and 50% in subsequent quarters, that shows exceptional strength. You'll often find such companies in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and the [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) stock lists.


Earnings Per Share And Seasonality
----------------------------------


One thing to watch out for is seasonality. Some companies consistently make most of their money in one or two particular quarters. Be aware of this, so you judge earnings in a proper context. (The seasonality factor is often found in the company's 10-K report.)


Another factor to track is IBD's proprietary Earnings Per Share Rating, available with every detailed stock quote and in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


The EPS Rating measures a company's earnings growth and stability over the past five years vs. all the stocks in IBD's database. A rating of 99 means the stock is in the top 1%.


Factors used in the calculation include: earnings growth in the two recent quarters vs. the respective year ago quarters; the five year earnings growth rate; and earnings stability. Items are weighted by a proprietary calculation.

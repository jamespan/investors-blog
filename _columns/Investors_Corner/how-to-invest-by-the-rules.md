A rule can lead to different results, depending on how it's handled.

Novice IBD investors, if they don't know how to read a situation, can turn the 8% sell rule into a paper shredder â€” only the paper being shredded is green and has pictures of presidents on it. If you compound four 8% losses in a row, you're down 28%.

Standing at the other extreme are investors who seldom suffer an 8% loss. They sell modest winners before they turn negative. They sell losers before they reach the 8% loss.

What does the successful investor see that others miss?

If a stock breaks out Monday and triggers the 8% sell rule Tuesday, there's no room to avoid an 8% loss. Fortunately, that's fairly rare. More often, a stock will drop a series of hints before outright failure.

**Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) broke out Jan. 31 in heavy volume. But the stock, while up 1.7%, closed under the buy point. The next day, Toll dropped 5.7% below the buy point **1**, though volume was weaker than the previous day.

Was it time to sell? Most investors would probably have given the stock more time. It was early.

Over the next eight sessions, Toll rose back toward break even. On Feb. 14, the stock cleared the entry again but in weak trade **2**. Not ideal, but you could argue it already broke out in strong volume.

By Feb. 21, the 15-day mark, the most Toll had risen above the buy point was 2% **3**. Why do we care about the 15-day mark? Many big winners will rise 20% or more in the first three weeks after a breakout. Toll was saying, "Forget that."

Do you sell? Probably not: Toll was holding above its short term, 10-day moving average **4**. The stock held that line, rising 6% above the buy point March 4. (The 10-day line is used on [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) for fine tuning.)

The first reasonable exit came March 10, when Toll closed under the 10-day line **5**. An experienced IBD investor might've said: "I've owned this stock for five weeks and have little to show for it. Toll did stay above the 10-day line for 18 sessions in a row, but now it closed under the line and I have merely a 1.5% gain. This could easily cycle into a loss. Sell!"

Those who didn't sell there could've chosen an exit when it lost the 50-day line, 1.5% below the buy point **6**. This was the last exit before March 24, when Toll fell 7.9% below the buy point.

Top stocks have a lot of common traits, including strong fundamentals, excellent [mutual fund sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) and a top-notch management team, among other things.

Another common trait of top stocks? Strong price performance, otherwise known as [relative price strength](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/leader-laggard/).

Investors have a decision to make every day [in the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/). Some choose to focus on stocks that are far off highs â€” the ones on sale that look like they can't get any cheaper. But IBD readers know this is a risky strategy. Why? Because weak stocks often get weaker due to deteriorating fundamentals, shrinking market share, and a host of other factors.

Another common trait of weak price performers is that institutional sellers have sometimes been busy unloading shares. That begs the question: Does it really make sense to own a stock that institutional investors are selling with abandon? The answer is a resounding no. These stocks might seem inexpensive, but they're cheap for a reason.

## Top Stocks Have High RS Ratings

IBD's [Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) helps you identify the market's strongest performers. Stocks are rated on a 1-99 scale with 99 being the best. Stocks rated 99 have outperformed 99% of the stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2IC042318.jpg)But the path to outperformance isn't only about targeting stocks with the highest RS ratings. Many can be extended in price, or too late to buy, after recent base breakouts. Others might be extended after recently finding support at the 50-day moving average for the first time after a breakout.

The trick is to find the strongest performers with high RS ratings as they build new bases. The accompanying table is a select group of stocks from IBD growth screens like [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). All have healthy charts and are potentially actionable as they consolidate gains.

Keep in mind that a large-cap growth screen like the Big Cap 20 will house some stocks with lukewarm RS ratings below 80. In many cases, though, stocks like this boast healthy charts.

The reason for an RS Rating in the 60s or 70s, for example, is because large-cap stocks tend to be slower-moving than a high-octane growth stock. Recent IPOs with a limited trading history might start off with seemingly low RS ratings as well.

In a recent Big Cap 20 screen, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) offered a good example when it was [setting up in a flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 176.66 buy point. At the time, its RS Rating was 96. Group peer **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) also boasted a healthy RS Rating of 86 when it was recently forming a base with a 129.97 entry.

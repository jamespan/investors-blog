*Seventh In A Series*

  

Hey, here's a stock tip for you.

  

Ready? This is it: Don't listen much to stock tips.

  

One key psychological problem for investors is that many give too much weight to other people's views.

  

It's OK to listen a little to these opinions. But keep in mind that's all they are â€” opinions.

  

You really have to do your own research, which takes time. There's no way around it. Even IBD articles should just be viewed as starting points. Read them, and then do your homework.

  

William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, wrote: "Many people are too willing to risk their hard-earned money on the basis of what someone else says, rather than taking the time to study, learn and know for sure what they're doing."

  

He has warned against buying solely on tips, advisory-service recommendations or advice from analysts or other market experts.

  

**OpenTable** ([OPEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPEN)) provides a good example of how relying on opinions could have been hazardous to your wealth.

  

The provider of Web-based restaurant reservations has been in a steady, even steep, downtrend since early May. But before this slide in recent months, the stock staged an impressive run.

  

IBD-style investors had the chance to profit from this advance, as long as they did their homework and took all of the chatter around the stock with a grain of salt.

  

The May 2009 IPO achieved a big gain from February 2010 through late 2010. Yet even after that, it still hadn't lost steam.

  

You could have bought the stock as it cleared a base in the first week of January 2011. **1** The possible buy point was at 76.79, as noted by various IBD articles written around that time.

  

The stock ended up climbing as high as 55% beyond 76.79 before starting its downtrend in May. **2**

  

In order to take part in some of this run, you had to avoid getting psyched out by other people's opinions. In January, bloggers were writing about how OpenTable was "highly overvalued" and a short candidate. They were right eventually, but the stock continued to run up from January through April.

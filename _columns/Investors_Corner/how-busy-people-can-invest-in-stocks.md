Following the stock market can be tough if your job demands all of your time during market hours.

  

Is there a shortcut that can get you up to speed quickly?

  

While shortcuts aren't ideal, one way to find good stock ideas fast is IBD's Stocks On The Move.

  

The list (published today on this page) comprises stocks that traded with unusually high volume vs. their 50-day moving average. Bigger-than-normal volume points to institutional investors trading the stocks, and it's what often causes stocks to make their big moves.

  

Daily gainers on the list with EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings of 80 or better are put in bold type. Those are stocks that deserve a closer look.

  

Last July 11, the Nasdaq delivered a follow-through rally confirmation, which meant the odds favored buyers. Let's assume an investor read about this signal in the next day's IBD and started looking for stocks to buy.

  

NYSE and Nasdaq Stocks On The Move in the July 12 IBD edition included 10 stocks in bold that showed volume 40% or more above average. If an investor tossed the stocks that weren't near a buy point, five stocks would remain. Let's take a look.

  

Packaging Corporation of **America** ([PKG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PKG)) cleared a 50.88 buy point July 11 **(1)** in big volume. On July 12, the stock opened at 51.95 â€” within 5% of the entry, which meant the stock was in a proper buy range. In three or four months, the stock had advanced 20% to 25% **(2)**.

  

A 20% to 25% profit is often a place to take profits. Most stocks start to pull back after such a gain.

  

**Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)) was extended from the buy point July 12. However, a pullback and bounce July 16-17 put shares back in the buy range. From there, the stock took about two months to hit the 20% profit-taking zone.

  

**Advanced Energy Industries** ([AEIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEIS)) was extended from the buy zone July 12. This spared the day-late investor because the breakout failed.

  

**Santarus** broke out in strong volume July 11, clearing a 24.10 buy point. The next day, it was still in the 5% buy zone. After rising 8% from the ideal buy point, the stock reversed and triggered the 8% sell rule. (Early this year, **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) completed the acquisition of Santarus.)

  

Making Stocks On The Move didn't make these stocks ideal buys. But they did give the busy investor something to work with.

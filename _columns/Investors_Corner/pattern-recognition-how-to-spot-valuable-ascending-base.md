While fundamentals dictate which stocks to buy, the technicals help you ensure you're buying at the right time — as it crosses a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/).

Chart reading can take months, even years, of practice, and even then it can be an art as well as a science. By looking at hundreds — if not thousands — of charts every week, dedicated investors can hone their eye to easily recognize these patterns.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ICbaba091117-300x160.jpg)To help investors accelerate their mastery of this craft, [MarketSmith](http://marketsmith.investors.com/) — an IBD company — launched Pattern Recognition, a computer algorithm designed to pinpoint [seven moneymaking base patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) that occur throughout the history of the stock market.

[Stock market leader](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) member **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is forming a third-stage [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/rare-ascending-base-can-lead-to-powerful-gains/) with a 177.10 potential entry. An ascending base is characterized by three separate pullbacks — each with a higher high and a higher low — over the course of nine to 16 weeks.

Each pullback typically corrects between 10% and 20% from its recent high to low. [MarketSmith Pattern Recognition](http://marketsmith.investors.com/special/MS_PatternRecManual_1-7-5.pdf) uses a range of 6% and 25% for the depth of each pullback to account for a stock's individual behavior of volatility.

Ascending bases are rare yet powerful patterns that usually only apply to market leaders that are experiencing significant volatility during a weak general market. The stock is fighting to move higher, but is held back by a tired general market — like a basketball being held underwater.

Alibaba has certainly been a market leader, rising as much as 69% from a 104.67 [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) buy point. Not only has the stock been a leading stock, but its fundamentals are a clear step ahead of its competition.

As a China-based e-commerce play, Alibaba — and U.S.-based **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) — have avoided, if not caused, much of the turmoil within the traditional brick-and-mortar retail industry.

In the latest reported quarter, Alibaba grew earnings and sales 60% and 53%, respectively, year over year. The result? Two quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth — a [fundamental hallmark](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) of many of the best stock moves of all time.

Looking forward, analysts expect the company's earnings to rise 48% in fiscal-year 2018 and another 31% in 2019.

Now that the general market is back in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), look for Alibaba to begin to move up strongly to indicate higher stock prices may be in its future.

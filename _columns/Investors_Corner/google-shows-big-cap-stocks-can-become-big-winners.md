The goal of any investor is to spot small companies on their way to becoming the next **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) or **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). But big companies also can become big stock winners.

  

In the past, only small and midcap stocks — those with market capitalizations up to \$10 billion — offered the possibility of explosive returns. They trade a smaller number of shares, so relatively small purchases can drive the stock price up quickly. By the same token, they're risky, since a relatively small amount of selling can send the stock plunging.

  

But more money has been funneled into big-cap stocks in recent decades — especially those with strong fundamentals — as mutual funds have found themselves with more cash to spend.

  

Big cap stocks — those with market capitalizations greater than \$10 billion — often trade with a large daily volume, making it easier to enter and exit a position without causing wild gyrations. As a result, such stocks can deliver the best of both worlds: big gains and lower volatility.

  

To be sure, many big-cap stocks are old, lumbering giants with poor growth prospects. But the Big Cap 20, which appears every Tuesday in IBD, showcases stocks that sometimes lead their industry, usually boasting strong profit and sales growth.

  

As such, they have the potential to run up like their smaller counterparts, so it's a good place for risk-averse investors to look for potential winners.

  

Before buying, however, make sure the stock you're considering — big or small — has strong fundamentals and is breaking out of a proper base.

  

**Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) appeared in the Big Cap 20 in July 2005 as it was hitting a new high. As it turned out, that peak served as the left-side high of a cup-with-handle base.

  

The buy point was at the peak of the handle plus 10 cents, or 331.38. **1** Google broke out in the week of Oct. 21 in volume that was 48% above normal. **2** It rose 43% in 12 weeks, peaking at 475.11. **3**

  

On the day of its breakout, Google had a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, a 99 Earnings Per Share Rating and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 94 — all characteristic of the best growth stocks of any stripe.

  

Oddly enough, Google was a big-cap stock from day one. Its IPO in August 2004 valued the company at \$27 billion. It's now valued at \$175 billion.

  

Keep in mind that big-cap stocks are not without risk. Many plunged along with the overall market during the bear market of 2007-08. Also, some markets favor small caps over big caps.

  

"From time to time, the market will shift its emphasis from small caps to large caps and vice versa," IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in his book, "How to Make Money in Stocks."

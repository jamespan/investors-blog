There's an old saying about something being as bad as "a poke in the eye with a sharp stick."

On a stock chart, the Nasdaq's dive from a short-term high July 22 to an intraday low Aug. 9 felt like a poke in the eye with a sharp stick **1**.

In just 12 sessions, the Nasdaq lopped off 527 points, or 18%.

Insult was added to injury a few months later when the Nasdaq marked a lower intraday low Oct. 4 **2**. But that move wasn't straight down. It was more like "a slap across the face with a wet fish," which offers its own form of investing discomfort.

Forced to choose between the two pains, most investors would rather suffer a slap across the face with a wet fish than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Yet whatever damage was suffered from July to October, disciplined investors were asking this question: What stocks outperformed during this back-to-back turmoil?

The outperformers were, and in some cases still are, worth a look. A stock that outperforms the market during a negative swing is showing strength. Sometimes, though not always, that strength will persist, providing future opportunities.

Let's go back and look at the period from late July to early October. What stocks did well?

Some stocks — such as credit card provider **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), drug developer **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and risk assessment services provider **Verisk Analytics** ([VRSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRSK)) — showed strength by finishing that period only 1% down vs. the Nasdaq's 18% drop.

Now, no investor is in the game to lose less than the averages. Getting poor slowly is no virtue. But a stock that keeps its loss small during a big decline is showing extraordinary strength. Such stocks probably belong on a watch list.

Other stocks actually notched gains during the decline from July 22 through Oct. 3. They include:

•Discount retailer **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), which rose 11%. The stock shaped a cup-with-handle base and broke out past a 34.27 buy point Aug. 30.

•**Randgold Resources** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), up 9%. The stock broke out in mid-July and advanced while the market corrected.

•**Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)), up 8%. The stock cleared a resistance area in a consolidation in late August.

•**Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), up 7%. The stock broke out of a seven-week base in late August.

•**AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)), up 5%. The stock cleared a pattern in late August.

•**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), up 4%. The stock cleared a V-shaped pattern in early September.

•**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), up 3%. The stock cleared a six-week consolidation in September.

•**Advance Auto Parts** ([AAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAP)), up 1%. This stock made the list on a technicality. While it rose 1% during the July-October turbulence, it began sliding sharply in May.

  Slacker Stocks Seldom Win: Stay With Quality For Long-Haul Success

Quality matters in the stock market. While that idea might sound self-evident, it's human nature to look for a beaten-down stock that hopefully will stage a heroic rebound.


The peculiar thing is that no one would do the same in their work life. Would you hire an employee who has been fired multiple times in the hope that the slacker will turn into a go-getter? "Hire the loser, he's due!" Yet individual investors too often do exactly that with stocks.


Buying the dregs in the hope of a heroic rebound makes no sense when you could buy quality.


Too often the heroic comeback -- if it occurs at all -- comes after years of sluggish performance. When the loser stock finally returns to break even, the investor will dump it -- sometimes just as the company's fundamentals have finally turned around.


Thus the individual investor manages to be wrong twice on the same stock: A bad buy followed by a bad sell.


Have you ever done that? Probably most individual investors have at some point. The key is to quit doing that. Make a commitment now to buy only stocks with strong fundamentals and technicals.


In “How to Make Money in Stocks,” William O'Neil, the master of growth investing, explains the hazards of bargain shopping in the market.


“If you buy a stock that hasn’t moved much, or that has even fallen to a price that makes it seem like a bargain and therefore safer, chance are that you’ve picked a stock with little potential. There’s a reason, after all, that it’s at the bottom of the pile.”


The flip side of avoiding duds is buying quality.


O’Neil continued: “You should buy the really great companies — those that lead their industries and are number one in their particular fields. All of my best big winners. . . were the number one companies in their industry space at the time I purchased them.


“By number one, I don’t mean the largest company or the one with the most recognized brand name. I mean the one with the best quarterly and annual earnings growth, the highest return on equity, the widest profit margins, the strongest sales growth, and the most dynamic stock-price action. This type of company will also have a unique and superior product or service and be gaining market share from its older, less innovative competitors.”


The standard approach to buying quality stocks is a three-step process.


First, make sure the stock market is in a strong uptrend. You want a tailwind for your stock, not a headwind. Second, determine which sectors and industry groups are leading the uptrend. Third, find the leaders within the leading groups.


"The stocks within a given sector do not all perform at the same rate," O'Neil observed. "Even if a sector is outperforming other sectors, there may be segments of that sector that are performing extremely well and others that are lagging the market. It's important that you be able to recognize what industry group within the sector is acting the very best, since this knowledge can mean the difference between superior and mediocre results."


As far as the slacker stocks go, be aware that occasionally a junk stock blooms into a winner. While that makes for a good anecdote, it remains a low-odds investment strategy. Sticking with the odds will, over the long haul, give investors a much better return.

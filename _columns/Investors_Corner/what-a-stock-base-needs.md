A stock needs the right ingredients to succeed.


When a stock breaks out of a base in big volume, some people think that's enough. If the base, however, is flawed in one or more ways, the breakout will probably fail.


How can this be? Isn't the breakout in strong volume a sign of institutional activity? It is, but there's more work behind a fine bunch of hush puppies than just showing up when you hear the dinner bell.


A breakout is sort of like that dinner bell. It catches your attention, but you're in for a disappointment if the minced green onions were left out of the hush puppies.


Likewise, you want to make sure nothing is missing in a stock's base.


One key ingredient is upside volume within the base. Think of it this way: Heavy volume on the breakout certainly is evidence that at least one fund is behind a stock. But upside volume within the base points to active institutional activity over a longer period and probably from more than one source.


To increase your odds of success, you really want both ingredients.


Yet, there is an exception to strong volume within the base. The flat base often involves quiet volume. In fact, a volume dry-up within the flat base is a positive. The flat base is often a second-stage pattern. This shallow and short pattern points to a lack of sellers. Funds are gripping shares tightly, probably from the first-stage pattern, and perhaps adding lesser amounts to existing positions.


That's a different situation than what is reflected in deeper bases.


In most bases, however, upside volume is a key ingredient.


**Fresh Market** ([TFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TFM)), a chain of upscale European-style grocers, launched its initial public offering in November 2010.


The stock began forming its first base in December 2010. The base was 20% deep â€” too much for a flat base but perfect for a cup. The cup-without-handle pattern was seven weeks long by February 2011.


On Feb. 18, 2011, the stock broke out in volume 69% above average.


There were many things wrong with the stock. One was the lack of upside volume within the base. The three up weeks in the base showed timid volume. **(1)**


Without the broader support within the base, the breakout quickly failed. **(2)**

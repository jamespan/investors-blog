Learning to recognize the warnings that a stock market leader may be about to turn tail is a valuable skill.

  

But for stocks related to commodities, those warnings come with an added dimension: the price of the commodity itself.

  

A fall in oil or gold prices may or may not signal a pending top in any given stock. Each company is unique, and so is its stock. So it pays to read a stock's individual chart signals and to pay close attention to the action of the underlying commodity.

  

Let's study two oil explorers.

  

**Whiting Petroleum** ([WLL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLL)) cleared a first-stage cup base with a 50.08 buy point in July 2013. It ran up 86% in 13 months, then nosed into a six-week dive in September. **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) broke out from an [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) base in November 2012. It jumped 433% before pulling the ripcord in July.

  

Oil prices topped, then started pulling back in late June. Diamondback stock started to come apart soon afterward, undercutting its 50-day moving average in rising trade on July 31.

  

Investors with a healthy profit cushion in the stock weren't likely to exit. Diamondback's 7% drop in the week ended Aug. 1 wasn't pretty, but it came in light volume. And it was almost identical to the start of the base that launched the stock higher earlier in the year.

  

One could have assumed that oil prices could quickly bob back. However, the oil market sent some critical signals in late July that should have had investors on their toes. By July 15, oil futures had pulled back 8% from their June high to test support at the 200-day moving average. Over the next handful of sessions, oil rebounded yet failed to regain the 50-day line.

  

When that effort started to collapse on July 24, oil investors were on notice. On July 31, Diamondback cracked through the 50-day moving average in heavy volume. In August, the stock tried to rebound back above the key line, which was now slanting lower. No such luck.

  

On Sept. 4, Diamondback slumped 5% and closed sharply below the 50-day line. Volume grew 79% above average. That was like holding the exit door wide open.

  

Oil prices, meanwhile, slid below key levels of support.

  

While Diamondback tried and failed to climb as oil prices backed off, Whiting stabbed higher in heavy trade. It jumped 12% in the month of June and another 10% in July, then pulled back for a test of support at its 10-week moving average **(1)**.

  

In mid-August, Whiting made eight straight gains and reached a new high, but most of the up days came in soft trade. It was a curious divergence from late July to early August, when Whiting fell in heavy trade in seven separate sessions.

  

Oil prices were waving red flags. On Aug. 14, West Texas Intermediate futures dived 3% in heavy trade, drilling deeper below their 200-day moving average.

  

Whiting whiffed to a peak in very quiet trade — a key sell signal — on Aug. 29 (please see a daily chart). Then it began to pull back. The stock has swiftly cut below its 10- and 40-week moving averages.

  

Now 29% below its peak, Whiting could easily form a base. But oil prices, now at 18-month lows, are likely to have a say in whether or not base-forming takes place.

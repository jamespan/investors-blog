Top stocks don't go up in a vacuum. In fact, there's a specific set of traits to look for when searching for the next big stock market winner.

A consistent track record of big earnings and sales growth is mandatory, plus strong annual earnings estimates. In addition, top stocks are often leaders in their industry groups — not laggards. And top stocks often have bullish [sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) trends as mutual funds and other institutional investors build positions.

But perhaps even more important is that many tops stocks have something "[new](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/)" going on. It might be a new product or service that's driving big growth. Or the company might be adapting to new conditions in its industry, ready to capitalize on the next wave of growth.

Other times, a new forward-looking CEO might be in place, pivoting the company toward new growth opportunities.

## Top Stocks: What's New?

Over the past year or so, three stocks in the [current stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) have the "new" in spades.

When it comes to a new product or service, **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)) certainly passes muster. Demand has been strong for the company's continuous glucose monitoring systems, used by diabetics to better track their blood glucose levels.

![Top stocks like Dexcom have a new product that's driving big growth.](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ICdxcm021119.jpg)The company is on the verge of profitability and sales growth has accelerated for multiple quarters in recent years. In its latest reported quarter, sales jumped 39% to \$336 million; Dexcom also posted earnings in three of the past four quarters.

The company, along with partner Verily, also has plans to launch a less expensive and fully disposable continuous glucose monitor in 2020. Verily is **Alphabet**'s ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) research organization specializing in life sciences.

Meanwhile, a new CEO is in place at **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)). Brian Niccol took over in March 2018 and has the company focused on digital and delivery to fuel growth. And analysts certainly are optimistic about growth prospects.

[Annual earnings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/annual-earnings/) are seen rising 51% in 2019.

It's not often that a stock can recover after a 67% pullback, but that's exactly what Chipotle did from August 2015 to February 2018.

Shares have recovered impressively since then and posted new all-time highs this year.

Indeed, Wall Street seems to be growing more confident about the prospects for a turnaround. Shares gapped up powerfully early Thursday after the company reported another quarter of accelerating sales growth, better-than-expected same-store sales growth and a 66% rise in digital sales.

## Xilinx Has Led The Chip Sector

In the semiconductor space, **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) has turned into a big winner as the company capitalizes on new conditions in its industry. The company's communications chips are seeing strong demand, helped by LTE upgrades, early 5G deployment in South Korea and preparation for 5G rollout in both China and North America.

Xilinx also recently launched Alveo, a portfolio of accelerator cards that improve the performance of servers across cloud and on-premise data centers.

The big cap presented a [solid breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) past a 76.30 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in August 2018. That breakout ushered an 85% advance to a high of 141.60 in just eight months. Xilinx shares are now in a deep correction, [forming a new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).

Reversals are one crucial way in which the big funds are forced to show their hand. They may not want to, but when they absolutely need to buy or sell a few million shares of something, they can't always be polite about it.

  

Reversals, both upside and downside, reveal where the big-money players feel a stock has gone too far.

  

A downside reversal is a daunting thing to sit through, especially in a growth stock that has been leading the market for some time. You almost know there are more shares looking for a home.

  

In a similar way, an upside reversal may be a big clue that the funds think the stock is quite a bargain.

  

They are no longer sitting around with quiet, open hands waiting for more downward drift. They're stepping up to the plate in an aggressive manner.

  

A reversal may appear on a daily or weekly chart, though the latter is usually a stronger statement.

  

First, let's look at exactly what makes a reversal. A weekly upside reversal usually first dips below the prior week's low, then rallies in heavy trade to close either with a gain or with a much-reduced loss.

  

The close would have to be in the upper 60% of the week's range, but a powerful upside reversal could easily close at or near the range's high.

  

Similarly, a downside weekly reversal first pokes above the prior week's high, then sells off to log a loss or a much-reduced gain. You just know that when you see a 7% gain end up just 0.3%, the stock must have a big problem.

  

The stock's close would have to be in the lower 60% of the week's trading range.

  

Again, you might see a dreadful downside reversal that ends at the worst price of the day.

  

A look at **Dell**'s ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) three-month cup-with-handle **1** that began in January 1995 shows how upside reversals can make a base look better. That base, and the period just preceding it, were riddled with upside reversals.

  

The first appeared in the Dec. 9 week **2**. Dell sneaked below the prior week's 19.50 low by 12 cents, then moved up to end in the upper 58% of the week's range â€” near the 60% threshold. The stock fell 12 cents for the week, paring a 6% loss to 0.6%.

  

Two weeks later, Dell made a new low for the move but turned that small loss into a 9% gain **3**.

  

Another upside reversal appeared in the Jan. 6, 1995, week **4**. A small loss turned into a 9% gain.

  

Note that so far Dell has offered no buy points. These upside reversals reveal the big buyers waiting in the wings, losing patience.

  

More appear in the weeks ended Feb. 10 **5** and March 3 **6**. In the latter, a 9% loss was pared to just 4%.

  

By this time, Dell's trading has tightened up. And you could probably find a base within a base. The breakout in the April 21 week **7** was one of many entries Dell created in its storied run-up.

When your stock shows signs of a climax top, you should be on red alert. Probably you have big gains in the stock, and there's no reason you should fritter them away. First, what is a climax top? It's just like it sounds, a final thrust higher after a long, successful run-up.

  

How long a run-up? At least 18 weeks from a first- or second-stage base. If the stock launches from a later-stage base, it can begin a climax top at any time.

  

Here are the signs of a climax:

  

• **Big blast.** Near the end, the climax-topping stock may put in accelerating price gains in a short time, perhaps 25% to 50% in just two or three weeks. Also look for seven rises in eight days, or eight gains in 10 days.

  

• **Broken channel line — on the upside.** Try drawing a line touching the upper end of a rising price channel, beginning near the breakout and connecting at least three points. If the stock rises above the upper channel line spanning several months, it's a sell signal.

  

• **Exhaustion gap:** After a long climb with big gains, your stock suddenly gaps higher. This shouldn't be confused with a breakaway gap. The breakaway gap often occurs on a breakout and is a bullish sign.

  

• **Largest daily point gain.** Like the exhaustion gap, check for such a point gain appearing after a big rally. The stock's rise should bring it into the climax-top time range, 18 weeks for an early-stage base.

  

• **Record-high volume.** Or at least the heaviest volume seen in the entire run-up.

  

• **The 200-day moving average.** When a stock rises 70% to 100% above its 200-day line, it's giving you a sign of a climax.

  

**Taser** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) took America by storm in the 2002-04 market, supplying law enforcement with a valuable new tool — a stun gun.

  

The stock soared 51% in the last three weeks of its performance **1**. Four gaps appeared on the daily chart in the last two months.

  

How many of these signals could you have lived with? When Taser logged a huge downside reversal with triple-pace volume in the week ended April 23, 2004, you had no more excuses not to sell.

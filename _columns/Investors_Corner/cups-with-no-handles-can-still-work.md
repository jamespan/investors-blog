  A Cup Doesn't Always Need A Handle To Work

While it's nice to see a stock pull back and catch its breath before it makes new highs, it doesn't always happen that way. That can be the story with the cup-without-handle base, which can be the setup to big winners.

The cup is one of the most common chart patterns that investors will find. But note that cups without handles are a bit riskier. They don't allow a stock to catch its breath, as a cup-with-handle pattern would.

Like with all bases, the stock should have a prior uptrend of 20% to 30%. A cup can be as short as six weeks. Most outstanding cup patterns will last between three and six months.

**Watch Cup Depth**

The correction in a cup should generally run no deeper than 30% to 35%. "It's normal for growth stocks to create cup patterns during intermediate declines in the general market and to correct 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the market averages," wrote IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil in the investment classic, "How to Make Money in Stocks."

In bear markets, cups can run as deep as 50%. But investors should generally pick those that correct the least.

A cup base should look just like that — a cup, tracing a U shape. The buy point is 10 cents above the left-side high of the base. Investors don't always have to wait for a handle to form and that's OK. This is especially true if the stock takes out the left-side high in heavy trade. Sometimes, the stock will start to run up in the days or weeks before the new high in heavy volume.

**Look For Rounded Bottoms**

A proper cup base should have a smooth bottom; that shows the stock going through a more natural, gradual correction. V-shaped patterns are less reliable. They don't allow the weak holders to get worn out.

It is nice to see tight trading within a base, but in the less-than-perfect world of investing, this isn't always the case.

Specialty metals maker **Allegheny Technologies** ([ATI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATI)) was a monster winner years ago. The stock formed a seven-week cup base in the latter part of 2005.

Allegheny's pattern had some tight areas — a good sign **1.** It was also a U-shaped base **2.** The stock cleared the 31.48 buy point in the week ended Nov. 25. The stock more than doubled by early April 2006.

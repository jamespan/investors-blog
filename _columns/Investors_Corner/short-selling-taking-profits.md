  Take Profits Judiciously When You're Short A Stock

There's an old saying on Wall Street: You never go broke taking a profit. IBD research has found that taking a 20%-25% gain in a stock when you have it is generally sound strategy. 

  

Why? Many stocks will pull back and consolidate after a gain of that nature.

  

This rule also applies when you've sold a stock short and it's falling nicely.

  

**Cepheid** ([CPHD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPHD)) joined the Leaderboard Cut List as a short idea in late November, when it was getting resistance at its 10-week moving average after a sharp pullback. The secondary short-sale entry was around 36.40 **1**.

  

One week later, the stock fell to 30.24, yielding a tidy 20% gain **2**.

  

Whether you're long or short a stock, taking a 20%-25% gain when you have it is generally sound strategy. But in some cases, letting your winners run makes sense. It just depends on where the stock is in its move.

  

If a former huge winner is still in the early stages of potential long-term decline, it's OK to let the leash out. If it's in the later stages, keep the leash tight.

  

So before you short a stock, note how far it is trading below its 52-week high. The larger the distance from that peak, the less likely that it's going to produce another big drop.

  

In volatile, whipsawing markets, when 20% gains are harder to achieve, take profits at 10% to 15% or less.

  

The best time to short a stock is when it's in the early stages of breaking down after a multiyear run. After hitting highs in November 2014, **Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) started to trend lower. It wasn't long before its 10-week moving average turned into a resistance level for the stock.

  

In April 2015, Keurig joined the Leaderboard Cut List as a short-sale idea; the stock kept getting turned away at its 10-week line. The sluggish action created a short sale entry near 120.

  

By May 7, the short sale yielded a 20% gain. But giving the stock a little more leeway for a bigger gain, especially amid rampant signs of institutional selling, made sense at the time.

  

Three months later, Keurig was trading around 52.

  

Cepheid presented a slightly different situation; it had fallen a lot already. Plus the market was volatile at the time, with big gains one day followed by steep losses the next. Locking in the 20% gain fast made a ton of sense.

Initial public offerings can be risky for stock investors, but pick the right one at the right time, and the profits can be huge. That was the case with **Apollo Education** ([APOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APOL)), which [went public](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in late 1994. Apollo was a pioneer in for-profit higher education. Within three years of going public, it would be operating more than 100 campuses of the University of Phoenix â€” at the time the nation's largest private university, with 40,000 students.

The students were mostly working adults who needed new skills to advance their careers or launch a new career. Courses of study included business, technology, nursing and education.

Regular stock bases, such as cups with handles or double bottoms, must be at least seven weeks long. Flat bases must be at least five weeks long. But an IPO base can be much shorter. In the case of Apollo, it was just 17 days.

Apollo went public Dec. 6, 1994, with a moderate increase.

IPOs are often intentionally underpriced, and a first-day surge is common. Most shares at the offering price have been bought in advance by institutional investors who have a relationship with the underwriter. An individual should never buy an IPO on the day it goes public. There's no way to tell which way it will go. Instead, wait until it sets up in a base, even a short one.

A hot IPO can form a shorter-than-usual base because few big investors own less than they would prefer. Rather than accumulate shares cautiously, they are forced to jump in before the stock gets away from them.

Average daily volume needs to be watched closely. Volume will be high for the first few days as many new shares turn over quickly. Some early buyers will try to flip shares, getting out with a quick profit. As the volume settles down, make sure you aren't buying a stock that is going to be thinly traded.

Apollo traded in a tight range between 12.25 and 11 while shaping its IPO base, a depth of just 11%. Volume dried up. Unlike many IPO bases, this one had remarkably steady price action.

The stock broke out Jan. 3, 1995. Volume was strong, but that was just the beginning. Volume surged more as the stock gained 26% the first week after the breakout and 15% the second week.

Apollo had the good luck of going public just as a great market rally was starting in 1995.

The rally made holding the stock easier than it would have been in less buoyant times. Apollo's rapid advance in the first three weeks out of its ascent from the IPO base signaled that it was likely a long-term winner.

Any stock that gains 20% or more in the first three weeks out of a base should be held eight weeks because it could emerge as a big winner.

The market's steady rise through 1995 and the first half of 1996 made for a smooth ride.

When you buy a stock, you want to buy the very best merchandise possible. Don't go for fourth or fifth best. Buying a leader will likely give you better performance.


Many investors like to buy the laggards in an industry for a variety of reasons. First, laggards are usually priced lower than the No. 1 or 2 in a group in dollar terms.


If you have \$20,000 to invest, you could buy 400 shares of a \$50 stock. But some investors would rather own 2,000 shares of a laggard trading at \$10 a share. Well, if you're dining out, would you rather have six tasteless ground-beef patties or one tender, juicy, flavorful rib-eye?


Laggards may also entice buyers because they're cheaper on a relative basis, using price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios.


Why pay 40 times earnings for a certain stock when there's one trading at only 10 times earnings? The leader is "overvalued" and the laggard is a much better bargain, right? Not necessarily.


In stocks and most things in life, things tend to be priced at what they're worth. When you buy a car, you can't expect the performance of a Porsche if you paid the price of a Yugo.


If you want to drastically outperform the market, put only the bona fide leaders in your portfolio. This means buying the top few companies in their industries. These are the firms with the most innovative products and services that are light years ahead of their competitors.


"The top one, two, or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir," wrote IBD Chairman William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is king of the Computer-Hardware/Peripherals group. The Cupertino, Calif.-based firm has consistently delivered blockbuster products that people line up for hours to buy.


The company has the highest possible EPS Rating of 99 and has posted solid double- to triple-digit profit growth quarter after quarter. Rivals **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) and  **Hewlett-Packard** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) have much weaker EPS Ratings and both have lackluster growth.


Even today, after making strong gains since its early 2004 breakout, Apple has gained as much as 14% from an early-August breakout. Dell and HP are down from their early August levels.

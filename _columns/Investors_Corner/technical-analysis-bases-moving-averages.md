A leading stock's 50-day moving average is a key support level to watch after the stock breaks out of a base. The strongest stocks tend to ride the average higher after an early-stage breakout.


You can use the 50-day line as a vital tool to screen stocks as well.


When building your watch list of stocks using growth screens like the IBD 50 (updated every day in [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/) ), [IPO Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm) (in IBD on Tuesday and Thursday) and the Big Cap 20 (most Tuesdays), make sure that the stocks are consolidating gains above their 50-day moving averages. (Mini charts in IBD are weekly charts and therefore show a stock's 10-week moving average.) These stocks have a better chance of breaking out successfully than those basing below their 50-day or 10-week lines.


Stocks trading comfortably above their 10-week lines are showing relative strength, and that's important to see as a stock is building a base. It's common for a stock to fall below its 10-week line as it builds a base; but as it starts to regain momentum, make sure that it's above its 10-week line as it nears a breakout area. At that point, the only resistance level it has to overcome is its prior high. If it's below its 10-week line, overhead supply becomes an issue; the 10-week line can turn into a resistance level.


A buy point in a flat base should appear above the 10-week line. The same holds true for a double-bottom pattern and a cup-with-handle pattern. A handle area that forms below the 10-week line is a no-no. This is another case where the 10-week line could be a difficult price area for a stock to punch through.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has been a solid performer this year after clearing a series of bases that showed supporting action at the 10-week moving average. The first breakout occurred during the week that ended April 24; the second one was during the week ended July 17; and the third one was during the week ended Oct. 23, soon after the S&P 500's follow-through day on Oct. 2.


Today, several other top-rated growth names are building bases above their 10-week lines. They include **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)), **Alliance Data Systems** ([ADS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADS)) and **LogMeIn** ([LOGM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOGM)). **Regeneron** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) recently cleared a double-bottom buy point of 557.97, but it added a handle area that shows an alternate buy point of 588.15.


**LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) is working on the right side of a deep, jagged base. Shares soared nearly 15% in the week that ended Oct. 30. It has yet to overtake its 276.18 high.

Investor's Business Daily emphasizes ways to track and benefit from moves made by smart-money institutional investors.


But there are some things individual investors can do better than the fat cats. One of those is to more intimately surf the uptrends and downturns in the market.


Seizing that advantage requires keeping close tabs on what the market is doing. That's why the M in CAN SLIM stands for "market direction." It reminds you to jump in when the market heads higher, and to get out when things go south.


Sounds simple. But like all worthwhile pursuits, doing it well requires a solid, sustained effort and usually a few hard-earned lessons.


That doesn't mean you must predict the direction of the market. You only need to listen to what the market is telling you today, this week, this month. To do that, you follow broad indexes like the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500.


Like individual stocks, index price-and-volume charts send signals on the status of the market. The better you learn to recognize those signals, the more attuned your trading will become.


To learn to read those cues, use IBD's daily Big Picture column on the front page and the accompanying Market Pulse table.


Monitoring the market should be part of any investor's daily routine. But there are really two zones in which a kind of hypervigilance becomes critical.


One is during a correction, or a substantial market decline. A correcting market will eventually bottom and begin a new uptrend . A follow-through day confirms the new rally has legs.


You need to recognize each potential bottom as it occurs. This, along with a watch list of basing stocks and having cash staged accordingly, keeps you prepared. Otherwise, a market follow-through will catch you off-guard. Leading stocks will break out and leave you behind. You give up a piece of your fleet-footed, little-guy advantage.


While bull markets tend to last three years or so, they always bump through periods of uncertainty. Sometimes, the market will ease into a mild correction, find support, then turn to run higher.


But if the market starts to build up five or six distribution days — when an index falls in higher volume — over a few weeks, investors' ears should be perked. As a bull market ages and leading stocks become extended and build late-stage bases, each investor should be ready to lock in gains, cut losses and raise cash for the next cycle.


To expand your study of markets, read the Market Direction chapter in "How to Make Money in Stocks," by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil.

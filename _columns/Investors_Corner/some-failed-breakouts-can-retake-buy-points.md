  How To Invest: Failed Breakout Isn't Always A Failure

Since Jan. 9, Investor's Corner has detailed a number of stocks with failed breakout attempts. Each one provided clues on how to read the warning signs and steer clear of others that show the same flaws.


The failures start when a stock clears a proper buy point, then falls back more than 8% below that mark. This triggers the golden sell rule: get out no deeper than 8% below your purchase price.


But then what?


Keep in mind that a failed breakout doesn't necessarily signal a failed stock. Many stocks with solid fundamentals recover, retake buy points and make winning runs. In some cases, the stock was ready to rally, but the market was not.


**W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)), a maintenance and industrial supplies distributor, has been in an uptrend since July 2009.


The base, begun in July, was V-shaped **1** and featured heavy selling on the left side — poor characteristics.


It still managed to form a handle with a 156.95 buy point and broke out in strong trade Sept. 13 **2**. The stock climbed for three days, then hit a peak of 165.55 and reversed. Over the next several days it dove more than 8% below the buy mark.


In the process, it carved through its 50-day moving average in strong trade. But it also found firm support at its 200-day moving average **3**.


Buyers who got burned by the faulty breakout may have gone looking for other candidates into which to rotate cash. But Grainger proved it wasn't yet a goner.


Let's say you've done your homework on the stock. If it has leadership-grade fundamentals, there's no harm in keeping an eye on it.


A rebound from support at the 200-day line and a rise back through the prior base's 156.95 buy point put Grainger back in play.


In the meantime, keep tabs on signs of heavy accumulation. Up days in higher volume and closes in the top half of the trading range suggest institutions may be quietly at work, picking up shares.


Grainger closed at the top of its trading range for the first three days above 200-day support **4**. Volume rose on the first and third days, too. Good signs. It retook the buy point Oct. 12 in mild volume. Not yet a buy.


Grainger hovered for three days, then broke out Oct. 18 with a 7% gain in nearly double its average trade **5**. It has since climbed 29%.

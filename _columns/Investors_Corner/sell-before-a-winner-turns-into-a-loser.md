In order to succeed in investing, you can't just shoot from the hip. Instead, some key rules must be followed. When a breakout that had been working well suddenly starts to fizzle, don't be a deer in the headlights. You need to take action or else watch those hard-earned gains disappear.


While IBD preaches to take profits once they amount to 20% to 25%, not every stock that breaks out from a base will go on to produce gains in this ideal range. Some of them will lose steam before rising 20% to 25%. Sometimes, they will fizzle much sooner.


Also, depending on market conditions, you might end up with a stock that rises 10% to 15% before heading back down. Other stocks will get your hopes up by rising just shy of 20% from a buy point and then break down.


If you catch a stock that rises at least 10% after breaking out from a base but then erases those gains, you should close out your position. This action is called a round trip, and it is a sell signal.


Watching a stock that gives up what was a healthy gain is bad enough already. But letting it go into negative territory is even worse. So if a stock wipes out a double-digit gain, investors don't have to wait until the stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point before selling. It's still better to get out even rather than take a loss.


**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) briefly cleared a 210.55 buy point from a handle June 5 this year in soft volume. Big volume arrived in the next trading session **(1)**. Shares of the gene-sequencing firm didn't move much initially, but they picked up the pace in July. The stock climbed 15% by July 20 **(2)**.


But on July 22, the stock gapped down, tumbling nearly 13% intraday on mixed second-quarter results **(3)**. The firm posted earnings that climbed 40% to 80 cents a share, beating views, but sales grew 21% to \$539.4 million, about \$3 million short of consensus. That was also the third straight quarter of mildly decelerating sales growth.


The big drop erased the entire 15% gain from the 210.55 entry, marking a sell signal. While some stocks do bounce back after pulling a round trip, Illumina didn't. The stock tried to stabilize near its 50-day line, but that soon gave way. By early October, the stock dropped as much as 46% from its July peak **(4)**.

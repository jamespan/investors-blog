*Screening For Winners: Second In A Series*

  

When old hands say the same thing, it's wise to listen.

  

If five baseball scouts were asked to name the best shortstop available in the draft and each said, "Joe Blow's your man," the boss would be smart to check out Joe Blow.

  

The same is true of stocks. IBD has a computer-generated screen that determines the IBD 50. Another screen shapes the Big Cap 20. Yet another makes up the 85-85 index. The screen for the Research Tables identifies sector leaders. Stock Spotlight is based on a screen, as is Top 15 World Stocks. And Investors.com has several different screens.

  

This can be disconcerting.

  

Some investors get irritated by multiple screens: "How about just giving me one screen instead of all these different screens? How do I know which one is right?"

  

Life is rarely that simple. At any given time, you will not know which baseball scout is most right. That's why teams employ more than one scout.

  

Like scouts, each stock screen has its own way of looking at things. But when you see the same name or names appearing in screen after screen, you can take that as an endorsement. It means the stock shines on just about any measure you can think of.

  

Today let's look at the screens available at Investors.com ([Click here](https://www.investors.com/StockResearch/ScreenCenter/) for Screen Center). This is important, since investors who read IBD in print sometimes overlook the features online. 

  

The features include:

  

• **Screen Of The Day.** This feature changes daily. Recent topics included a list of stocks with sales-growth rates of at least 25%; top-rated new issues; top-rated stocks that beat earnings estimates; stocks with strong pretax margins; and top-rated small caps.

  

• **Sector Leaders.** Because of some differences in the proprietary screening formula, the Sector Leaders screen at Investors.com differs from the sector leaders in the Research Tables. Pay attention when the same names pop up.

  

• **Tech Leaders.** This group is divided into several different groups, such as medical tech, Internet and telecom. The choices are listed in the pull-down menu. You can also view the results by fundamentals, IBD ratings, and price and volume action.

  

• **International Leaders.** These stocks can differ from the Top 15 World Stocks listed daily in the B section of the newspaper.

  

If a stock you are thinking of buying fails to make any of the screens in the paper or at Investors.com, you'd better take another look at its fundamentals and chart.

With thousands of stocks to choose from, finding excellent trade candidates can be like finding the proverbial golden needle in a haystack.

You can save time and work by using IBD's proprietary ratings to separate promising stocks from the rest of the pack. One rating that you should always look at is the Composite Rating.

The Composite Rating is made up of the Earnings Per Share Rating, Relative Price Strength Rating, Industry Group Relative Strength Rating, SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) Rating, Accumulation/Distribution Rating and the stock's distance from its 52-week high.

The Composite Rating places more weight on EPS and RS Ratings. It can quickly tell you whether a stock has a robust combination of fundamentals and technicals.

Like other IBD ratings, the Composite Rating goes from 1 to 99, with higher numbers being better. A 90 rating means that the stock has outperformed 90% of all other stocks in its combined ratings.

The Composite Rating is everywhere in IBD. Investors can find it in the stock tables, the mini charts, Stocks On The Move, the IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and the Big Cap 20.

Use the Composite Rating to filter quickly among IBD's stock screens and features to find issues that have the potential to make big runs. Focus on stocks with Composite Ratings of 90 or higher. But use the Composite Rating only as a starting point. You shouldn't buy just because a stock has a 95 or 99 Composite Rating.

It's smart to look at recent quarterly earnings and sales-growth figures, forward profit estimates and other metrics such as return on equity. Also be sure to read up on the company itself. Reading an IBD feature to find out what's driving top-line and bottom-line growth can help build your conviction in buying or holding.

Then, consult the stock's chart and buy only when a stock clears a base or a secondary setup.

The Composite Rating can also tell you about the strength of the market. Ideally, on a strong market session, you should see many stocks with high Composite Ratings up in heavy volume.

The accompanying table highlights top-ranking stocks trading close to their 52-week and all-time highs. Use the list to fortify your watch list for potential new buys at proper entry points.

The Earnings Stability Factor is often overlooked.

  

Granted, other items are more important, including earnings and sales growth.

  

But don't make the mistake of dismissing the stability rating.

  

A recent check of the IBD 50 found three of every four stocks had a three-year rating in the top 25% of the market. Almost two of every three had no worse than a 25 in the five-year rating.

  

The stability rating can be found on the weekly charts of MarketSmith, a sister company of IBD.

  

It is calculated by plotting quarterly earnings for three to five years to establish a trend line. The gauge measures the deviation from the trend line, and the calculations are in a rating from 1 to 99, with 1 being the most stable and 99 the most wild.

  

Some turnaround companies won't have an Earnings Stability Factor because they may have gone through a significant period of losses. Companies with higher ratings tend to be more cyclical.

  

Cyclical stocks — like machinery, steel and chemicals — seldom lead early in a bullish cycle, but they can show strength later in the cycle.

  

IBD studies found that one in every four of history's greatest stocks was either a cyclical or turnaround story. So, an investor shouldn't toss candidates simply because the stability rating is less than ideal. **Cliffs Natural Resources** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) produces and sells iron ore pellets to steel companies. That business is cyclical. Cliffs' current five-year Earnings Stability Factor is 59. But in mid-2004, Cliffs had no stability rating. From Q2 2001 through 2003, the company reported losses in seven of 11 quarters.

  

After that rough patch, Cliffs ' earnings jumped 64% and 241%.

  

The stock formed a cup-with-handle base in July 2004 and broke out July 14 **1**. Six sessions later, Cliffs triggered the 8% sell rule **2**.

  

The decline became a second handle **3**. Cliffs broke out July 29 in volume 231% heftier than usual **4**.

  

The stock advanced as much as 201% in eight months **5**.

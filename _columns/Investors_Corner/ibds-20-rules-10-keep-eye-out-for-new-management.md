*Tenth in a series*

  

Current GE chief Jeffrey Immelt once said that in the 1990s, a "German shepherd could have run GE."

  

In other words, it's not always that important who's in charge, such as during those boom years more than a decade ago.

  

Talk about an iffy premise. The fact is, leadership is critical at basically all times. Immelt's quote was featured in this column a year ago, but it's worth repeating because it's so wrong-headed.

  

IBD-style investors should have the opposite idea in mind. When looking into a stock, it's always important to check out the company's management. Oftentimes, a change in management will turn a stock market loser into winner.

  

With that in mind, one of IBD's 20 rules for investment success has to do with seeing if there's been a shift in a company's leadership.

  

Rule 10 states: "Check out companies buying back 5% to 10% or more of their stock and those with new management."

  

**Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) is a good example of a company that benefited from new management.

  

The online travel company's stock was struggling in November 2002 when Jeffery Boyd became the firm's CEO. Analysts have told IBD that before Boyd took over, Priceline had strayed from its original focus on name-your-own airfare and other travel-related services. It was dabbling in gas, groceries and even mortgages.

  

Boyd had the company return to its roots, stick with travel and grow, one analyst said in an interview with IBD last year.

  

Grow, indeed. Earnings per share rebounded 83% in 2003, then jumped 118% the next year as revenue growth returned. From 2005 to 2010, earnings rose 42% or faster every year. The CEO remains at Priceline's helm, and the company's stock continues to hold not far from its all-time high near 562.

  

IBD's focus on new management stems in part from the "N" in the newspaper's CAN SLIM investing strategy. The "N" stands for newer companies, new products, new management, new industry conditions or other fresh developments. IBD-style investors should focus on firms that somehow deliver in the "N" category.

  

William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has written that a change of management can bring "new vigor, new ideas, or at least a new broom to sweep everything clean." Perhaps the most famous recent example in this area comes from **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). The story of co-founder Steve Jobs returning to the firm and engineering its turnaround is now a well-known tale.

  

New management can't always make everything OK. **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) is a good example of a company that a new CEO wasn't able to turn around. Was it now-former CEO Carol Bartz's fault? Or was the firm simply stuck too deeply in the mud? That would take more than a short column to sort out.

  

Moving on: What about the stock buybacks mentioned in Rule 10?

  

It's generally nice to see repurchases in part because they limit the number of outstanding shares.

  

"In most but not all cases, it's usually a good sign when a company, especially a small- to medium-sized growth company that meets the CAN SLIM criteria, buys its own stock in the open market consistently over a period of time," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." It "usually implies that the company expects improved sales and earnings in the future."

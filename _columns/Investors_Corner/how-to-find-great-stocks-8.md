When **EMC** ([EMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMC)) hightailed its way out of a new base in December 1986, eight months after its initial public offering, IBD put a spotlight on it â€” sort of like California Highway Patrol helicopters in a nighttime car chase.

  

Back then, the IBD features that readers used for spotting emerging leaders had different names. But the process of hunting a great breakout hasn't changed.

  

Today, if you want to score a big winner, pay attention to companies that show outstanding increases in earnings and sales, high return on equity, and beefy profit margins. Using IBD's ratings makes that easy.

  

Next, scour the stocks that make IBD's daily screens, including the Stocks On The Move tables (on this page), Stock Spotlight (Page B5), IBD 50 (Mondays and Wednesdays), Big Cap 20 (Tuesdays) and the daily Sector Leaders feature (Page B1). [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), a premium service of IBD, can also help.

  

Read the columns associated with these screens and the line of chart analysis seen below each mini-chart. They will alert you to the proper buy point.

  

EMC emerged as a king of data-storage devices as computer use swelled in the office and laboratory, and consumers began buying personal computers.

  

The stock's first two bases did not work out. In the week ended May 23, 1986, EMC rose 20% in heavy trade and popped past a 15.85 buy point in a narrow IPO base **(1)**. But five weeks later, the stock slumped 20% and matched the base's low. It was wise to cut losses, even though the market was still in a hot uptrend.

  

When EMC broke out again in early July, the Nasdaq began to roll over. This was a strike against EMC. Also, notice how in this second base, the stock gushed straight up from the bottom to a new high **(2)**. That is unsound action. The risk of a failed breakout from a narrow IPO base is pretty high.

  

EMC's big move arrived Dec. 4. It rose 2.25, or 14%, and sprinted past a 17.60 cup-with-handle buy point in eight times normal trade. In the Dec. 5 edition of then-called Investor's Daily, EMC was listed sixth on the "50 Stocks With Greatest % Rise In Volume" table.

  

On the next page in the paper, the OTC Stocks In The News (now part of Stock Spotlight) featured EMC's weekly chart, noting a long-term EPS growth rate of 146%, a 99 EPS Rating and an 82 Relative Price Strength rating. EMC went on to rally 150% in nine months.

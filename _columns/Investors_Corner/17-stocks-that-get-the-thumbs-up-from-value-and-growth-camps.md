Will Danoff, fund manager of the A+ rated Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), and Warren Buffett of **Berkshire Hathaway** ([BRKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BRKA)) wouldn't at first glance seem to have much in common as investors.

Buffett is known as the consummate value investor. Danoff operates mostly in the growth camp. Yet in another sense, Buffett and Danoff are alike. Call it value or call it growth, eventually all investing is about recognizing quality and having a standby plan in place.
"The opportunities come. You just have to prepare for them," Danoff said in a March [interview with IBD](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/fidelitys-will-danoff-talks-about-the-super-bowl-and-super-stocks/).

Sometimes opportunities overlap the value and growth camps. For example, three of the top 10 holdings in Fidelity Contrafund are stocks that Berkshire Hathaway also had a stake in, as of Q1. The three are **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) and **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)). And a fourth stock in Contrafund's portfolio has considerable ties to Buffett: Contrafund owns shares in Berkshire Hathaway!

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IC_chart_072417-300x168.png)Berkshire has 46 stocks in its lineup. Contrafund has more than six times that number. How many stocks are in both funds? Seventeen.

The 17 in both Berkshire and Contrafund are: **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)), **Charter Communications** ([CHTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHTR)), **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), **Liberty Media** ([LSXMK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSXMK)), **M&T Bank** ([MTB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTB)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Sirius XM** ([SIRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIRI)), **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), **Kraft Heinz** ([KHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KHC)), **U.S. Bancorp** ([USB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USB)), **Wal-Mart Stores** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), Apple, Visa and Wells Fargo.

On the positive side, Contrafund either opened a position or added shares to an existing position in seven of the above stocks, based on the latest filings to the SEC. Berkshire added to three of the stocks. The seven, and the percentage additions, were:

Apple: Berkshire added 125% to its position; Contrafund, about 3%.

Southwest Airlines: Berkshire added 10%; Contrafund, 4%.

American Airlines: Berkshire added 8%; Contrafund opened a new position.

Wal-Mart: Contrafund added 40%; Berkshire stood pat.

Costco: Contrafund added 4%; Berkshire stood pat.

Goldman Sachs: Contrafund added 3%; Berkshire stood pat.

U.S. Bancorp: Contrafund added 2%; Berkshire stood pat.

What should the individual investor make of this?

IBD founder William J. O'Neil uses the holdings of quality funds as a confirmation when deciding whether to buy a stock. "Look for stocks that are held by at least one or two of the more savvy portfolio managers who have the best performance records," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

If the quality funds have all passed on a stock, there is no reason the individual investor should assume the risk.

In the cases of overlap, with savvy fund managers from the value and growth camps both owning shares of the same stock, the confirmation is clear and unique. Quality fund managers, using different methodologies, arrive at the same conclusion.

For individual investors, fund support is just one piece of the puzzle. Before buying any stock, individual investors need to do their own research.

For example, in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) at Investors.com, only two of the 17 stocks have Composite Ratings above 90. They are Mastercard and Visa with ratings of 95 and 94 respectively. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 95 puts a stock in the top 5 percentile among all stocks in IBD's database.

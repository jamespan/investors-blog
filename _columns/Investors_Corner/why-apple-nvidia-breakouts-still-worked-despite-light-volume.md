Longtime readers of Investor's Business Daily (started in April 1984), IBD Weekly (which launched in May 2016) and Investors.com know that one of the keys to a rewarding breakout by the top stocks is volume, and lots of it.




But in the current equities market, how much is really necessary?


Try this yardstick. For large and megacap companies, expect volume to rise 40% to 50% above the 50-day average or higher on the breakout day. Did you grab shares in a small or mid-cap leader? If yes, don't act surprised if the share turnover doubles or triples the usual amount.


As a stock gushes up in price and hits new highs, hearty volume is the ultimate indicator that mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, corporate finance departments, college endowments and the like are racing to grab as many as shares as possible. Their sustained buying powers a stock's path to new highs and marvelous gains.

Yet today's Wall Street is not your grandfather and grandmother's Wall Street.


Market Rules Matter
-------------------


As Regulation FD ("Fair Disclosure") has created an environment in which many stocks tend to see big moves after, and not before, the reporting of quarterly results, IBD has noticed an increasing number of true market winners that don't see volume really pick up until days or weeks after surpassing the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in, say, a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) or a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), another bullish chart pattern.


Reg FD, enacted in August 2000 by the Securities & Exchange Commission, may not be the only reason for this recent phenomenon. Other factors may be in play. A stock may break out late in the afternoon. Turnover may be dull overall in the Nasdaq or on the Big Board. A stock may be moving right before or right after a three-day holiday weekend.


Yet in this age of light-speed information, one can understand why even the biggest mutual funds, hedge funds and large advisory firms hesitate to move into a stock with serious size before earnings and fresh outlooks hit the wires.


Growth Stocks And How They Break Out
------------------------------------



Take **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) as it rallied past a 118.12 buy point within a 12-week [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on Jan. 6, 2017. On those two days respectively, volume was flat and 7% higher than average.


Yet the stock made a slow but steady ascent until it flew 6% higher on Feb. 1 in huge volume, 273% above average, following better-than-expected Q1 results the prior day.


Apple eventually rallied as much as 97% past the 118.12 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) to its peak of 233 in October last year. The mega cap formed a new base and has broken out again, rushing past a new buy point of 197.79 in a extra-large [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).


How This Nvidia Breakout Began In March 2016
--------------------------------------------


![ICnvda021317](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ICnvda021317-1024x550.png)When **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) initially moved past its cup-with-handle base with a 33.16 entry on March 16, 2016, (see the accompanying weekly chart), turnover fell 6% below average. Two days later, volume picked up a decent 40% above typical levels as the stock rallied 3%.


Notice how volume for the week grew sharply vs. the prior week **(1)**. Demand among large fund managers intensified.


Then the whales really jumped into the stock almost nine weeks later after the chip firm announced accelerating EPS and revenue growth. As Nvidia soared 15% to 40.98, *volume ballooned 500% above average*.


Still, one should not ignore IBD's research on big winners in the dozens of past bull markets over the past century.


A minimum 40% jump in breakout volume vs. the stock's 50-day moving average still boosts the odds of success. And among small or midcap stocks, it's quite normal to see turnover spike 100%, 200% or more above average on the breakout day.


Don't Forget This 'Investing Tip'
---------------------------------


Breakouts also work much better in a [solid market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), less so in choppy conditions, and practically never in bear markets.



When **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), which debuted on the Nasdaq on March 17, 1986, broke out of its initial four-month base on Oct. 17 the same year, volume surged 396% above average as shares crossed a 35.60 buy point.


That day, 432,100 shares changed hands, vs. the 50-day average of 87,100. The market was near the end of a significant correction. And the king of operating-system software for the PC revolution went on to rally 345% until its Oct. 5, 1987, peak before Black Monday, on Oct. 19.

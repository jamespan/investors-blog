Suppose you're studying two stocks and can't decide which is stronger.

As you weigh the fundamentals, you discover the two stocks are about equal. You check the industry group ratings and find both stocks are in leading groups. Each has strong institutional support.

Is there anything left that can tell you which is the stronger stock? Yes, there is, and this factor is often overlooked.

The Relative Strength line is an important clue. The RS line compares a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500 index, one of the major stock benchmarks. An upward sloping line means the stock is outperforming the index.

You can find the RS line on the MarketSmith charts and on the IBD charts at Investors.com. It appears on both weekly and daily charts, below the price bars.

If the stock's RS line is rising to a 52-week high as the stock breaks out, that's a bullish sign. If the RS line reaches a new high before the stock breaks out, that's even better.

**An Unhealthy RS Line**

But if the RS line is sagging or moving sideways, that suggests weakness or mediocrity. In fact, a lagging RS line can indicate it's time to take profits, even if the stock is breaking out of a new base.

Here are two examples from September 2010. (September was a good month for breakouts, with many winners shooting up as the market turned. As the accompanying list shows, most successful breakouts came with the RS line at a high.)

On Sept. 1, the Nasdaq delivered a follow-through day, confirming an uptrend was under way. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) cleared a cup-with-handle base that same day.

The stock leapt past the 154.53 buy point in double volume.

In the two previous quarters, Chipotle grew EPS 53% and 33%. Sales growth accelerated from 12% to 16% to 20%. Margin after taxes was 9.9% in the June 2010 quarter, the best in at least 15 quarters.

The RS line began making new highs two weeks before the breakout. ([Click here](/NewsAndAnalysis/PhotoPopup.aspx?path=WEBcmg0407.jpg&docId=568322) to see the daily chart.)

After the breakout, Chipotle rose 70% in three months.

About three weeks after Chipotle's breakout, gold miner **Newmont Mining** ([NEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEM)) broke out.

Newmont had boosted EPS 89% and 77% in the previous two quarters. Revenue rose 46% and 34%. But its RS line was well off a high ([click here](/NewsAndAnalysis/PhotoPopup.aspx?path=WEBnem0407.jpg&docId=568323) to see the daily chart).

The stock rolled over. A month later Newmont triggered the 8% sell rule.

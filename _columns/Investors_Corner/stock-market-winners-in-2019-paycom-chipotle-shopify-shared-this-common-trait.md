It's been a great year for the stock market, and it's no secret what fueled the price performance of many of the year's top stocks. Whether it was enterprise software leader **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)), top restaurant stock **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) or e-commerce support play **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), many stock market winners shared a common bond: All had [the N in CAN SLIM in spades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), which stands for new.




Several stock market winners adapted successfully to new conditions in their industry. Others had a new CEO in place, engineering a turnaround. Still others had a new product or service that drove — and continues to drive — big growth and market share gains.


Stock Market Leaders
--------------------


[Software stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-cloud-stocks/) were big winners in 2019 thanks to burgeoning demand for software as a service, otherwise known as cloud computing.

Specifically, **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) benefited from new conditions in their industry — namely, burgeoning demand for workforce management software.


Paycom cleared a cup-shaped base in early February. It rallied 50% from the 164.18 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) before settling into a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) in July.


After a short-lived breakout, Paycom's latest cup-shaped base undercut the low of the flat base, serving to [reset the base the count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/).


Meanwhile, a new CEO at **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) has reinvigorated growth.


Brian Niccol, formerly the CEO of Taco Bell, took over the reins at Chipotle in March 2018. Among other things, Niccol has modernized stores and turned the company's attention to digital orders. In Q3, same-store sales increased 11%, while online sales surged 88%.



In late November, Cowen called Chipotle one of its "best ideas" in 2020, predicting that over the next five years, online sales will account for 34% of total sales. That would be up sharply from about 18% currently.


Chipotle stock is up more than 90% so far in 2019, compared to a gain of around 19% for IBD's restaurant retail group.


Shopify Stock
-------------


Stock market leader Shopify also has the "new" in spades. The company sets up e-commerce websites for small business and partners with others to handle digital payments and shipping. Earlier this month, the company said merchant customers worldwide generated \$2.9 billion in sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. That's up 60% from the year-ago period.



Of course, the outperformance of semiconductor stocks in the stock market has been well documented in 2019 as Wall Street bets on a turnaround. [Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) is well positioned for growth. It designs of high-speed data transmission chips for cloud data centers and communications systems, two fast-growing areas in the chip sector currently.

Every stock enthusiast will at some point be in the troubling position of missing out on a big market winner. But the intelligent investor will keep a close eye on the best stocks so they are in a position to pounce when an opportunity arises in the form of the flat base.




Those who admire Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) could have taken advantage of this proven pattern to net a gain of more than 20% following a breakout earlier this year.


Wall Street legend William O'Neil, the man who founded IBD, wrote in his classic tome "How to Make Money in Stocks" that the flat base is a key tool for investors looking to establish a position in top stocks.


How To Spot A Flat Base
-----------------------


There are a number of ingredients to look out for when eyeing a possible flat base. Firstly, is the consolidation happening after an advance from a previous base?


Flat bases will often appear after prior uptrends of 20% or more. A stock will digest gains following its run-up, with institutional investors supporting the stock as they accumulate shares within a certain price range.


This slow but steady process of accumulation takes place over a period of at least five weeks. It allows big money, such as mutual funds, to establish a large position without rapidly driving up the price. This process creates resistance as well as support, because professionals will seek to avoid paying out above a certain level for their target stock.


The long and steady grind that will ensue also serves as a mechanism to shake out weak holders. Unlike sharper drops in classic patterns such as the [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/), impatient traders will cash in their stock to seek faster-moving action elsewhere.


Such attritional action could be likened to slow-moving trench warfare, as opposed to the blitzkrieg-like rapid and wild action of meme stocks and IPOs. The seemingly dull action is marked by declines of 15% or less in the pattern.


Flat Base Made Gains As Easy As ABC For Alphabet
------------------------------------------------


In Alphabet's case, it started to form a flat base in late April 2021 after a quick 13% gain from a late-March breakout. No, there wasn't a 20% prior uptrend. However, this was part of a string of rapid consolidations following a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) breakout in late November 2020. The stock had run up nearly 45% from that base's buy point.

From its consolidation high of 2,431.38 **(1)** to its May 12 low of 2,193.62 **(2)**, the stock declined just 9.8%. This is comfortably within the required range for a flat base.


The buy point in a flat base is the base's peak. Alphabet broke past its buy point of 2,431.38 on June 10 **(3)**. [Volume should be at least 40% above average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) on the breakout. In this case, it was smaller. Sometimes that happens with breakouts of megacaps like Alphabet. On the weekly chart, however, volume jumped from the prior week.


The stock continued its slow but graceful ascent until Sept. 1, when it began digesting gains once again after reaching the 2,925.08 level. At this stage, Google stock had netted investors from its prior base an impressive gain of just over 20%.

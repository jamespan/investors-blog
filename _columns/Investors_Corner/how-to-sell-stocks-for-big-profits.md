As a young stockbroker trying to figure out the market in the 1950s to early 1960s, Bill O'Neil made an important observation.

He noticed that stocks tend to rise from a proper base, advance 20% to 25%, then correct, often forming a new base. So O'Neil came up with an important component of his plan for stock market success: Sell most of your stocks once they rise 20% to 25%.

O'Neil, founder and chairman of IBD, also noticed that if a stock made a big advance right out of the gate, it had the best chance of being a big winner. So he came up with another rule. If a stock advances at least 20% in the first two or three weeks after breaking out of a base, hold it at least eight weeks, then decide whether to hold it for the long term, hoping for a big gain.

This plan gave him several advantages. If he cut his losses at 8%, he could have two losses and one profit, and still make money.

His plan also allowed him to concentrate his money in his best stocks. He could sell his slower-moving stocks and have capital available to put into his best names as they reached secondary buy points.

The plan also counteracts a weakness that most investors must deal with. Fully invested when a market turns down, they give back too much or even all of their gains before they sell everything and go to cash. Markets tend to rise slowly but drop quickly. Locking in many gains along the way helps reduce the drawdown that inevitably comes at the end of a rally.

Another advantage: Use the same capital to take 20% profits three or four times in a year, and you have a solid gain in terms of the entire portfolio. Plus you make that money without having to sit through long corrections with the risk that the stocks you hold might never come back.

And there's a psychological advantage. It feels good to take a profit and gives you confidence that you can hold faster-moving names, knowing that you also have a significant sum in the realized capital gains column of your brokerage account.

Let's take the example of **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) in 2013, a time when the market was rallying and growth stocks were in favor. The casino operator was based in Las Vegas but was enjoying big growth thanks to its aggressive expansion into Chinese gambling mecca of Macau.

The stock formed a tight cup-with-handle base that showed plenty of signs of accumulation. It broke out on Sept. 4 with a 58.21 buy point. Volume was only 32% above average that day, slightly below the 40% standard that investors should expect. Large-cap stocks, like Las Vegas Sands, can be cut some slack on that account, as average daily dollar volume exceeded \$270 million at the time.

Las Vegas Sands, if properly bought, had made a 25% gain by Oct. 15 **(1)**, when it touched 72.76. It could have been sold right around there. Notice that the sell is made with the stock in an uptrend. No need to wait for weakness.

As it turned out, the stock advanced 26% by Oct. 21, then corrected 7% while it formed a flat base **(2)**, so the sell decision was a good one. You can never sell at the exact top. The stock went on to form a new flat base, broke out and advanced. But by booking profits, the investor avoided the risk of meltdown and had money available for even faster-moving names.

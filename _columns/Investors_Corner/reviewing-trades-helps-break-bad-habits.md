**Special Report:** [Personal Finance Action Plan For 2016](http://news.investors.com/special-report/787619-personal-finance-action-plan-for-2016.aspx)

The new year is a time to review old trades. And learning from your successes and failures helps you adjust trading behavior and improve results.

"When I started investing, I made most of the same mistakes you've probably made. I know how bad habits are formed and how hard it is to break them," William O'Neil wrote in "The Successful Investor." "But break them you must, so you can develop new habits based on how the market actually works."

Keeping a journal of your buys, adds and sells helps you [avoid repeating investing mistakes](http://news.investors.com/special-report/787619-personal-finance-action-plan-for-2016.aspx). Notes for each stock should incorporate key fundamental and technical criteria from IBD's CAN SLIM system. Did the stock have:

• Strong quarterly and annual profit and sales growth?

• A top position in its industry?

• Strong profit margins and return on equity?

• Strong institutional support?

• Unique or highly competitive new services or products?

Print out and mark up the stock's daily and weekly charts, noting characteristics of the base it formed. Look for evidence of accumulation and distribution, and areas of tight or loose trade. Note where you bought the stock and why, and when you sold.

You might also want to mark on the stock's chart when the market staged a follow-through, when it came under pressure, or when it started a correction.

On Aug. 3, **Fitbit** ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)) cleared a 49.08 buy point of an IPO base. It would have been easy to become enamored of the stock, given its triple-digit earnings and sales growth in the two quarters preceding its breakout.

Yet three trading days after its breakout, Fitbit erased a 6% gain past the 49.08 buy point. Volume surged to the downside 1, exceeding the heaviest trading days within the narrow base. That was the right time to sell. Today, Fitbit is more than 40% off its high.

Investors who held on should ask themselves if they'd grown emotionally attached to Fitbit.

Once you've identified a mistake, write it down. Keep it in mind when you trade with the goal of making 2016 a great year.

"You have to really blow the whole thing, then figure out exactly where you went wrong. Then you change things," O'Neil said in an [April 2004 interview](http://news.investors.com/management-leaders-and-success/041904-397358-ibd-founder-william-j-oneil-keep-learning-relentlessly-positive-he-says-errors-arent-just-for-baseball-players.htm).

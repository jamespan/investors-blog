  How To Invest: What Chart Flaws Can Show Up In A New IPO Base?

It might feel like an age-old sales ploy: "If you don't act now ... !" "Call before midnight ... !" For many investors, initial public offerings create that same sense of urgency and fear of missing out.


Sometimes IPOs live up to the hype, rocketing into the stratosphere without looking back.


But the chances are usually higher — as especially seen in years when the market is showing rocky action — that a brand-new IPO will enjoy a brief spurt, then gain little ground or even lose it. As an investor, your odds of booking a big gain are better if you wait.


You want an IPO, like any stock, to build a proper base and offer a buy point. Then you want to see a convincing breakout in strong volume.


IPOs receive some leniency when it comes to judging fundamentals. Their earnings record might be young. But on the technical side, always hold them to the same chart standards as you would more mature stocks.


There will be exceptions, such as Google operator Alphabet in 2004 or China's Home Inns in 2006. But, in general, how do you treat a flat base that's only three weeks long? That may be a key flaw. Is the cup just five weeks old? Again, the risk of a fake-out — rather than a true breakout — is higher than normal, unless the company has truly spectacular fundamentals.


Also, most IPO bases are not preceded by a 30% advance, a requirement for all proper bases.


The majority of highflying IPOs build valid entry points into their charts. Only 10 of the 151 IPOs in the past year took off within six weeks of their debuts — a period too short in which to form most bases — to post gains of 20% or more.
One of the better lessons in patience comes from **Sensata Technologies** ([ST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ST)) in the spring of 2010. The Attleboro, Mass., maker of sensors and voltage controllers went public March 11. It nailed a high of 19 on its opening day, then slipped into a consolidation that looked somewhat like a square-box base.


A square-box base must gestate for at least four weeks before breaking above the high point in the structure. The decline within the base must also be less than 15%. Technically, Sensata did just that.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IC_st_050317-300x276.png)But a base normally begins with the first down week in the pattern. Sensata didn't post a lower weekly close until the third week of its consolidation **(1)**. When it broke above the would-be buy point of 19.10 on April 14 **(2)**, the consolidation was not yet four weeks old. In other words, no proper base yet.


Investors would also have been flying blind with regard to volume. Did the breakout occur on an increase in daily trade of more than 40% above average? There is no way to know in a stock that is so young. It has not yet had time to establish a 50-day moving average for volume, the critical line of demarcation used to gauge volume changes.


Sensata's shares ran up 17% through April 23. But the false breakout revealed another trait common to new issues: They sometimes consolidate or form bases near market peaks. The general market turned lower in the last week of April 2010. Sensata rolled over right along with it.


IBD's After Market brief story and screen, at the top of the [New America page](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-new-america/) in the IBD Weekly print edition, picked up Sensata's progress shortly after it formed a bottom in its multimonth consolidation. The July 22 After Market noted that it had turned profitable after years of losses and had raised its guidance for the year. The Sept. 23 After Market spotted Sensata's 3% surge in heavy trading, adding that the stock had been forming a base since April **(3)**.


Shares moved past the 21.22 buy point in two days of heavy trading after Sensata's Q3 earnings report on Oct. 20 **(4)**. The After Market brief on Oct. 29 (at the time, it was a daily feature) noted the breakout, as well as the stock's 8% surge that day due to its acquisition of **Honeywell**'s ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) automotive sensor unit **(5)**.


By February 2011, Sensata ran up 62% from the 21.22 proper buy point to as high as 34.45, then showed a choppy rise over the next five months. In July, Sensata peaked at 39.63 before diving into a serious correction.


In the latest edition of IBD Weekly (May 1, 2017), the After Market feature also shows eight companies that have achieved a gain of 80% or more from their respective offering prices. They include **Noble Midstream Partners** ([NBLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NBLX)), **Ichor** ([ICHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICHR)), **FB Financial** ([FBK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBK)) and **Airgain** ([AIRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIRG)). (See the top of Page A6 to see the entire After Market feature.)


The After Market also compares the IBD New Issues Index against the S&P 500 via an indexed chart that currently starts in May 2016.

In recent days, this space has been devoted to ways in which leading stocks can top.

Weakness in the broad market can cause a leading stock to roll over a lengthy uptrend. That's what happened to **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) in [1987](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/721261-microsoft-fell-during-black-monday-stock-market-crash.htm). Or a stock can top after falling sharply in the heaviest volume since the breakout. **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) suffered this fate in November 2007.

Stocks top in many different ways, but a consistent element of the topping process is institutional selling. Repeated heavy-volume declines for several weeks after a long uptrend is always a sign that mutual funds and other large investors are liquidating their positions.

But sometimes, the selling isn't so obvious.

Keep an eye out for "railroad tracks" at a stock's high. Railroad tracks are ubiquitous across the country, but they're not all that common in the stock market â€” unless a stock is near a top.

The price action occurs over a two-week period. Sometimes near a top, a stock will retrace the prior week's large price spread and close the week slightly higher or mostly unchanged from the prior week. Volume is heavy, and yet the stock fails to make much price progress. On a weekly chart, it looks like two parallel vertical lines resembling railroad tracks.

**Schnitzer Steel** ([SCHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHN)) showed price action like the one seen in its chart near the end of 2003 after a big run-up. The steel producer was a beneficiary of the bull market that began in March 2003.

It cleared a cup-with-handle base in January, two months before the market's bullish follow-through day on March 17. Over the next nine months, it rallied almost 400%. During the week ended Nov. 28, the stock surged 21% **(1)** after already being very extended in price.

The following week, its range for the week was nearly identical to the prior week's **(2)**, typical of a railroad-tracks formation. Higher volume and no price progress signaled churning, showing that buying demand was drying up. Schnitzer rallied for a few more weeks before falling 46% over the next 4-1/2 months.

Fundamentals can look the best at or near a stock's top. In October, Schnitzer reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit of 84 cents a share, up 600% from a year earlier. Sales rose 53% to \$153.6 million. For the full year, earnings rose 529% from 2002 while sales rose 42% to \$496.9 million.

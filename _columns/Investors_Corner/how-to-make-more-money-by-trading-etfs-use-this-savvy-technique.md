Is there any surprise to why many people invest and trade in ETFs today? Definitely not. Exchange traded funds can be bought or sold in real time. They offer an amazing diversity of choices. The fund expenses are low.


But if you really desire to succeed in the game of making money with these speculative vehicles, there's at least one thing you must do that is no different from investors in individual growth stocks. You must use charts correctly and get your market timing right.


You must also be wise on the selling side. Know when to exit so you can lock in gains appropriately when you are right and keep losses small when you are wrong. IBD's [golden rule of selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) applies as much as to ETFs as it does to stocks.



Let's consider the WisdomTree India Earnings ([EPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPI)) ETF. According to the WisdomTree literature, EPI "seeks to track the investment results of profitable companies in the Indian equity market."  The top 10 holdings include a few companies whose American depositary receipts (ADS) trade in the U.S., including **Infosys** ([INFY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INFY)) and **Icici Bank** ([IBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBN)).


As seen in the accompanying weekly chart, EPI has thrived in 2017 so far. Despite Wednesday's 1.5% drop, to 26.18, the ETF closed Wednesday with an impressive 29.6% gain since Jan. 1. That even pounds the 17.6% advance by the leading U.S. equities benchmark, the Nasdaq composite.


Yet buying a country-sector ETF at the start of the year and hoping for a marvelous gain does not guarantee your portfolio will glitter like gold.


What if you bought \$10,000 worth of shares on the first trading day of 2016 at 19.50? In less than six weeks, your investment would have fallen to \$8,500 as the ETF fell to as low as 16.55. EPI eventually rebounded, but still finished the year only slightly ahead.


White Elephant Days
-------------------


Given the expectations that India has emerged as a long-term economic growth story, you might wonder if an ETF such as WisdomTree India Earnings would be much better as a buy-and-hold strategy. Not necessarily.


In the week ended Nov. 5, 2010, EPI peaked at 28.72, then began to fall. If you bought shares at the start of the new year in 2011, at around 25, then you certainly got a "discount" from the all-time high. But over the next three years, EPI kept sliding. By late August 2013, the ETF dropped to 12.99, down 48% from 25 and down 55% from the all-time peak of 28.72. Today, EPI is still a few points below that high water mark.


For these reasons, why not employ IBD's chart-analysis technique to time your buy into ETFs as well? You may not have learned about stock charts during your days in high school, college or grad school. Fine. That doesn't mean they cannot help improve your results.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IC_epi_080917.jpg)If you watched the action of WisdomTree India Earnings from September 2016 to January of this year, you would have spotted the ETF forming a 24-week flat base. In a [flat-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-why-the-flat-base-square-box-show-bullish-action/), the decline from head to toe must not exceed 15%. In EPI's case, it corrected just 13% to a low of 19.43. The high in the flat base was 22.38; add a dime to get the precise buy point.


On Feb. 21, EPI shot past the 22.48 buy point with a 1.9% gap up to 22.57. Volume grew 26% above its 50-day average. You could have bought shares over the next 15 sessions and your timing would still be excellent. EPI finally jumped out of buy range on March 15; the fund closed up 2.1% at 23.92, more than 5% above the proper entry.


In July, the ETF broke out again, this time clearing a 25.57 buy point in a new seven-week flat base. Because EPI didn't rally 20% from the first base before producing this new pattern, the base stage stays the same at first stage. One, in fact, could call the pair of bases a base-on-base pattern.


When's the right time to sell? One good exit point: when EPI rises 20% to 25% above either of the two entry points. Have superb conviction? You can decide to hold longer.

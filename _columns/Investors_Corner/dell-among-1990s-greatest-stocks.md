Hindsight is 20/20, as the old saying goes. So while it may be too late to buy some of the greatest stocks in history, studying their charts can be helpful.

  

After all, how else would anyone know what types of patterns stocks commonly set up before breaking out, or what constitutes positive or negative price and volume action on a chart?

  

"The first step in learning how to pick big stock market winners is to examine leaders of the past ... to learn all the characteristics of the most successful stocks," IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

"From these observations, you will be able to recognize the types of price and earnings patterns these stocks developed just before their spectacular price advances," he wrote.

  

That's why he analyzed the most successful stocks over the past 125 years and developed the CAN SLIM investment strategy, which incorporates the key fundamental and technical traits of those winners.

  

Dell, which revolutionized the PC industry with its custom-built, mail-order business model, secured its place as one of the best stocks of the 1990s. Founder Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners took it private in 2013.

  

But the stock had an amazing run during the 1990s. Shares of the Round Rock, Texas-based company staged a run-up of more than 120,000% from its February 1990 low to its peak in April 2000.

  

While the stock formed a series of bases during the massive advance, for this column, we'll take a look at the breakout that occurred in early August 1996.

  

The stock kicked off the left side of a base in November 1995. It corrected a steeper-than-normal 53% from the November peak to its January 1996 low. The base had some rather wide and loose action, but it was acceptable given the big advance it had already made.

  

Four months later, Dell broke out past the 49.48 (split-adjusted) buy point. Shares advanced just 4% before turning south again to form another base, resulting in a base-on-base pattern. This one consolidated for seven weeks, corrected 29% and displayed tighter overall action.

  

Dell showed ample signs of accumulation within the base, with three heavy-volume up weeks outpacing one down week in above-average trade. The last week of June showed strong support, as the stock fell as much as 12% but pared its losses to close with a 2% loss in fast turnover **(1)**.

  

Shares also finished above their 10-week moving average that week. That action, plus the close in the upper half of the weekly range, indicate that mutual funds and other institutional investors weren't selling off shares.

  

The stock cleared a 57.35 buy point the week ended Aug. 2, 1996. Though heavy volume didn't come in until two weeks later **(2)**, the stock was well on its way to its March 2000 peak.

  

And the big advance wasn't fueled by just strong technicals on the stock charts. A growth tailwind helped drive Dell, too.

  

As noted in Chapter 3 of "How to Make Money in Stocks," its earnings per share soared 74% and 108% in the two quarters ahead of its price run-up from November 1996.

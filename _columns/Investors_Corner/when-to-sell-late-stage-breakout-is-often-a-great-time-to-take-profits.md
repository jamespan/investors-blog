Do you know your sell rules?

If you are going to be one of [the great investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) in growth stocks, this is an absolute must.

Pundits, talking heads, your friends at the gym and your hard-to-shut-up neighbor will continually feed you ideas on what to buy and when to buy it.

But do they ever alert you to the right time to sell?

If you don't have a proper exit strategy with each stock in the market, your chances of making money consistently are likely no better than when a thrill-seeking greenhorn sits at the blackjack, baccarat or roulette tables. You can boost your profits by selling near the top of a big stock's run, but the first step is to know the signs.

That's where the use of [high-quality charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) comes in.

Crucially, a stock will often give you a sell signal so clear that you can only ignore it at your peril. Consider the failure of a late-stage base as a stock's way of saying it's done.

First things first. How do you count bases?

When a stock has risen at least 20% from a proper buy point in a base, then starts to correct, a new base is forming. But if a stock rallies, say, only 10% or 15% after breaking out, then begins work on a new base, the count does not go up. Those two bases would count as a single "base on base" pattern.

Three or four bases could be considered "late stage." And five or six? Definitely.

Imagine what you risk by extending the stock some leeway. Maybe you bought the stock as it formed that late-stage base.

Why would you do such a thing? A late pattern is itself a flaw. Well, maybe the base was especially tight, and the price-volume action looked ideal. Or the group was hot. But failure is failure. And failing from a late-stage base suggests that there's lots of room on the downside after a long run-up.

Perhaps yours was a long-held position. So you have a bigger profit cushion than recent buyers. So what? That you have "some room" when the stock starts misbehaving is no reason to surrender a substantial portion of your hard-fought gains.

The story of **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) is classic. Maybe you bought the stock at 27.47 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in February 2012) as it broke out from an early-stage flat base in January 2011. (See a long-term weekly chart; that entry point is not seen in the accompanying weekly chart.) It was the latest in a string of tight bases that proved, collectively, to be a long base-on-base pattern.

![ic_mnst_092716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IC_mnst_092716-1024x551.jpg)The next base appeared in the seven weeks through the week ended Aug. 19, 2011 **(1)**. A five-week flat base appearing a few months later **(2)** was tighter -- and, as a base on base to the August pattern, kept the base count relatively low.

From this latter pattern, the stock soared 72% to 83.96, with an ugly downside reversal in the week ended May 4, 2012 **(3)**.

That negative reversal, along with the highest volume of any session since the breakout, was itself a major sell signal.

The sideways to higher drift seen in the ensuing seven weeks was the stock's attempt to build another base. The attempt was poor, the pattern hard to define -- except that it was a late-stage structure.

The final straw appeared in late June 2012, with the stock slicing its 10-week line in monster volume **(4)**. Why might you have given Monster some room after such a show of weakness? Perhaps because the stock ended the week in the upper half of that trading range? Well, that was, strictly speaking, an upside reversal.

But you had "Monster" profits in this stock, which you started accumulating either at 19.15 or at 27.47. And it was failing from a late-stage base. Enough said.

Investing is an intense pursuit, one in which a disciplined, laserlike focus often pays off.

But a tight focus also means risking large areas of omission.

IBD's CAN SLIM investing strategy is designed to be sure that while individual investors focus, they continue to include all the vitals affecting their trades.

Ignoring any one CAN SLIM component can leave a crucial blind spot able to undercut all your other efforts.

Among those, the last element to remember is the M in CAN SLIM. It stands for market direction. Invest only when the market is in a confirmed uptrend.

The M also reminds investors not to fall into the bad habit of trying to forecast the market — not to get caught up in worrying over where the market is headed next week, next month, next year.

IBD takes a more here-and-now approach. The rules here are simple: Keep your investments to a manageable few. Pay close attention to each chart. Manage your investments according to the behavior of each individual stock.

And the M reminds you to pin the backdrop — the overall stock market. The tighter you dial in your attention to this type of stock tending, the more fascinating the lessons become.

The fastest, simplest way to follow the market is to read IBD's daily [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) articles.

These provide an overview of each day's market action, including a quick-glance status indicator, the Market Pulse.

The Big Picture doesn't try to tell you where the market will be six or 12 months from now. It counsels investors as to how aggressive or cautious they might want to be, given the market's current behavior.

A confirmed uptrend with institutional money moving into the market gives a risk-on signal. This frees investors to buy leading stocks breaking out past buy points, or to add to current holdings when stock charts provide follow-on opportunities.

The Big Picture and Market Pulse keep a tally of distribution days on the major indexes.

A distribution day occurs when an index falls at least 0.2% in higher trade. This indicates unusually strong selling by institutional investors such as hedge funds and mutual funds. During a buildup of such sessions in a short period, IBD will shift its Market Pulse status indicator to "uptrend under pressure." This suggests smart money investors should begin adopting a bearish stance.

This is not an immediate exit sign or a sell signal. But it generally cautions investors to sharply limit buying activity and to take profit where prudent.

If the status downshifts further, into market correction, the cautions noted in The Big Picture become even more bold and investors should significantly dial down their risk tolerance.

One good example was the new-wave printer maker **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) in January. Shareholders may have been tempted to buy and add to their position when the stock found strong volume support at its 50-day moving average on Jan. 14 and 15.

But heavy-volume losses by the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on Monday the 13th shifted the market's status to uptrend under pressure. That, combined with 3D Systems' late-stage status, made a follow-on buy a clear no-go.

The market dipped for just a few weeks before launching a fresh uptrend.

But it was the last call for 3D Systems, which remains 45% below its January high.

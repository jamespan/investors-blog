Growth stocks can be a double-edged sword for investors.


Leading stocks tend to outperform the major averages significantly during a market uptrend. On the other hand, they can fall 1.5 to 2.5 times faster than their peers when the market corrects.


"With greater opportunity comes significant additional risk," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


This explains why IBD gives as much attention to sell rules as it does buy rules. Knowing how to protect profits and cut losses short is crucial to becoming a successful IBD investor.


Knowing about this tendency by the leading stocks is also key when it comes to buying stocks. After all, if the market falls, say, 10%, you can expect a future leader to fall 15% to 25% or so.


Growth stocks typically fall 12% to 33% as they build cup bases, flat bases and double-bottom bases. This is a normal decline before a great stock breaks out to new highs and big gains.


Online travel broker **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) showed the perils and the opportunities inherent in leading growth stocks.


Priceline cleared a 235.90 buy point in a cup-with-handle base in early March 2010, rising 16% over the next eight weeks to a high of 273.93 on April 29.


But on May 5, the stock sliced through its 50-day in heavy volume **(1)** (weekly chart is shown), the same day that IBD's Market Pulse switched to "market in correction." That could have been taken as a sell signal.


From there, the stock continued to fall, sinking 37% from its high over the next five weeks. That was 2.2 times the S&P 500's 17% correction from late April to early July.


Nothing had changed with Priceline's fundamentals â€” they were top-notch. It's just that few stocks can survive a market slump.


Priceline's correction turned into a cup-with-handle base with a 234.55 buy point. It broke out in the week ended Aug. 6, a month after the market switched back into a confirmed uptrend. It went on to more than double, hitting a high of 561.88 in the week of May 6, 2011, before consolidating.


While buying a stock is based on fundamental and technical factors, selling is based purely on the technicals. That's because many growth stocks will correct well before weakness shows up in their fundamentals.

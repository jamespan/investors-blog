Monthly charts are probably the least used charts in an investor's toolbox. Yet making monthly charts part of your routine is a good idea.

  

A long chart can smooth out bumps and make a trend clearer.

  

A long base can last a year or more and is often not visible on a daily or weekly chart. Often, the handle of a long base will look like a flat base on weekly and daily charts.

  

If the handle of a long pattern on a monthly chart offers the same buy point as the short pattern on the weekly or daily chart, what is the point of the monthly chart? It actually has several advantages.

  

First, consolidating action that goes on for years can depress a stock's Relative Price Strength Rating. Normally, an investor should avoid a stock that has a lackluster RS. However, in the context of a longer base, the RS isn't nearly as important.

  

Second, overhead supply is less of a concern in a long base. A long consolidation wears out the weak holders. A breakout is more likely to work with strong holders.

  

Third, a long base takes a stock off most investors' radar. Either the stock is a big cap that hasn't made a splash in years, or the stock is a former leader that has skipped a cycle or two. The leaders of one market cycle seldom lead in the next market cycle. However, they can come back and lead after missing one or more cycles.

  

Biomet began consolidating in late July 2001. The company, which makes medical products, including artificial knees and hips, saw its stock rise more than 800% in 1993-2001. It was due for a rest.

  

The consolidation lasted more than two years, culminating in a breakout on Sept. 18, 2003. The stock cleared a 33.60 buy point in volume 240% above average. On the daily chart, the breakout appeared to come from a six-month cup. The RS line was rising but was well off its high. This fact could've been seen as a negative.

  

On the monthly chart, however, the RS line told a different story. The monthly chart showed a 26-month cup with handle **(1)**. While the S&P 500 had been declining in a choppy fashion as Biomet based **(2)**, Biomet's RS line was rising **(3)**. It pointed to outperformance.

  

Biomet gained 48% in the 10 months after the breakout. In September 2007, a private equity firm took Biomet private.

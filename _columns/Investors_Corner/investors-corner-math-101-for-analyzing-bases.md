If you write computer programs or have a Ph.D. in math, read no further.

Today's column is for newer readers of IBD who may feel a bit intimidated by charts and the liberal use of calculations and numbers found in our market columns.

Truth is, the arithmetic used to diagnose the soundness of a stock's chart is not hard. Once you get used to doing a few of them, it's a breeze. Mastering these simple skills will make you a sharper chart reader.

The most important mathematical task involved in analyzing a base pattern is figuring out the stock's drop from high to low.

Favor stocks that show smaller percentage declines. They indicate that shareholders won't let the stock fall much in value. They treasure the stock. At some point, such a stock will stop dropping and begin to rebound. That's the time to keep the stock on your radar.

You should use the intraday (or intraweek) high and low, not the closing high and closing low, to calculate percentage changes.

Consider recent IPO hot rod **IntraLinks** ([IL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IL)) . Its first long base, built from November 2010 to February this year, worked well for the bulls.

The intraday high within the 11-week base was 22.94 **1**, and the intraday low was 18.42 **2**, marked on Dec. 14. So what was the size of the drop?

First, subtract the low from the high; 22.94 minus 18.42 gives you 4.52 points. Second, divide 4.52 by 22.94, the highest price point, and you get 0.197, which is simply a ratio of how much the stock lost its maximum value.

Next, multiply by 100 to get a percentage, or 19.7%. Such a decline from IntraLinks' high is a superb show of strength. Why?

Before the correction, the software stock jumped to new highs and cleared an initial-base buy point of 13.60. From there it reached 22.94, a gain of 9.34 points. Divide that number by 13.60 — the price in which it began its strong run — and you get 0.687, or a percentage gain of 68.7%.

After such a big increase, a 19.7% pullback is mild.

Keep in mind that the decline in a cup base can be as shallow as 12%. Top stocks generally never fall more than 33%-35% in a base.

What about the narrow four-week consolidation that fizzled when IntraLinks tried to break out Nov. 22 **3**? With a high of 22.43 and a low of 18.42, the 4.01-point, 18% drop exceeded the maximum 15% drop allowed for a square box.

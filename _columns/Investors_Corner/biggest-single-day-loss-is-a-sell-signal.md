Stocks unfortunately do not go straight up. While down days are inevitable, they aren't all bad.

  

After a strong rally, it's good to see a stock pull back, catch its breath and set the stage for the next leg up. But watch out for unusually big price drops.

  

How big? Take a cautious stance when a stock has its biggest one-day point loss since the start of the move. This could be the end of the run â€” and time to lock in profits.

  

When a stock has its biggest one-day drop since the beginning of its advance, take that as a sell signal. After a run of many weeks or months, with single-session point losses of no more than, say, three or four points, watch out when a stock starts sliding five, six, seven points or more.

  

This action marks a change in character. Basically, it's telling you that sellers have taken control. The biggest one-day point loss is especially bad if it takes place in heavy volume, as that tells you the big guns such as hedge funds and mutual funds are unloading shares.

  

A boxer can take a few jabs here and there and not suffer too much damage. But a huge right hook to the chin or temple will take him out. That's kind of like the stock's biggest one-day point loss.

  

It is easy to check whether the day's drop was indeed the biggest single-day point drop since the beginning of the big advance. You can use the free IBD Charts on Investors.com or [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com) .

**Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) cleared a 46.02 buy point from a cup with handle on Sept. 15, 2010, in huge volume. The stock carved out a nice uptrend and more than doubled by February 2011 before pulling back to its 50-day moving average. For months, down days following its breakout had been under three points each time. Although it slumped nearly six points in heavy trading Jan. 19, it soon bounced back.

  

But on April 21, Sina plunged nearly 10 points in more than double its average trade for its biggest one-day point loss since the initial breakout **1**.

  

Sina held near its 50-day line in May. But the rebound effort failed, as the stock sliced its 50-day line in hefty volume June 3, down 13.54 points **2**. By the end of the year, Sina tumbled 68% from its April 19 peak of 147.12 to a low of 46.86.

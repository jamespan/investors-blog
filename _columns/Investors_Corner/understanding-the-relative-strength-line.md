Stock charts are a collection of facts and tools: price, volume, moving averages. All of them help you understand how a stock and its investors are responding to market input and supply and demand.

One very helpful but often lesser-used tool is the Relative Strength line. The line is not available on many mapping services, but it is central to IBD charts.

The RS line compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500, the proxy for the broad market. When the line is sloping higher, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 market benchmark. When it's moving sideways, the stock is more or less in line with the S&P 500. When it's sloping downward, the stock is underperforming.

Don't confuse the RS line with the Relative Price Strength Rating. The line weighs a stock against the S&P 500. The rating gauges a stock's 12-month price action vs. the broader collection of stocks in the William O'Neil & Co. database.

RS lines are supplemental tools. They corroborate and confirm; they do not say, "Buy." But at critical moments, what the RS line says about a stock can be revealing.

In an ideal situation, the RS line will rise just ahead of a stock's breakout. This movement showcases a stock's strength ahead of a breakout.

In practice, it doesn't happen very often.

But RS lines do regularly run higher and approach highs ahead of a breakout. When a stock does stab past a buy point, RS lines quite often will snap to new high ground. This action confirms the breakout's strength and suggests that the stock is set to upshift to new high ground.

Israel's **Taro Pharmaceuticals** ([TARO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TARO)) had invested \$60 million during the 1990s to develop new drugs. By 2000, the investment was beginning to pay off. Revenue growth accelerated; earnings jumped 114% in 1999 and 87% in 2000, when the end of the tech bubble was about to crash the market.

The stock had been a little slow to catch on. It climbed out of a two-year consolidation, briefly hitting a high in October 1999. Then, as the Nasdaq powered to its peak and collapsed, Taro burrowed in for a seven-month nap.

But the S&P 500 kept rising. Taro woke up, snapping up to form a flat-base pattern for six weeks, starting in mid-June 2000. Taro's RS line was rising — hitting new short-term highs but still below highs notched in January and the prior October — as the stock broke out of the base in huge trade on July 20. The RS line received a boost from the S&P 500, which slumped for two weeks as Taro broke out. The Nasdaq was rolling over even harder.

A few months later, in October, Taro set up another base, a six-week cup. When it cracked the buy point with an 11% gain in better than double its average trade on Oct. 20, the RS line was already taking out new highs — partly because the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell early in the week, then rallied Thursday and Friday.

The brief rally did not mark the start of a new uptrend. But it may have given risk-tolerant investors enough intestinal fortitude to jump into Taro.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 corrected for another two years. Taro, on the other hand, rose nearly 400% over the next eight months.

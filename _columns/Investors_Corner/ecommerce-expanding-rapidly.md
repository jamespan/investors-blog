Growth stock investors, take note: The future of some market winners may be driven by China's rapidly growing middle class. This section of the most populous country in the world is expected to offer big opportunities to companies able to tap into rising demand for a wide range of goods, from clothes to food to electronic gadgets.


Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), said in the company's annual report in October that China's middle-class population — now close to 300 million, or nearly the size of the entire U.S. — will grow to 500 million in the next decade.


"China has an awesome consumer story," according to a post in May on the website of consulting firm [McKinsey & Co](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/strategy/why_chinas_consumers_will_continue_to_surprise_the_world). "The reality is that Chinese consumers are going to continue to increase in wealth and complexity," said the report's authors, Jeffrey Towson, managing partner of investment firm Towson Capital, and Jonathan Woetzel, a director in McKinsey's Shanghai office.


They added that Chinese consumers "dwarf" developing economies in nations such as Brazil, Russia and India in terms of household income.


All of these countries get coverage in IBD's "Global Leaders," today on Page B10.


**Retail Sales Rising**


Here's another fact to keep in mind: Ma says the level of consumption among the middle class is "still well below their income level."


Chinese people tend to save much of what they earn because they lack retirement and health care safety nets.


Nevertheless, retail sales jumped 11% in October from a year earlier to \$445 billion, the biggest increase this year, according to the latest official data. Sales so far this year are running nearly 11% above last year's pace, led by a 35% jump in online sales.


Ma has urged small and midsize Western companies to set up shop in China as the nation shifts from being an exporter to an importer that relies more on domestic consumption to fuel growth.


Much of that consumption will be conducted online, which stands to benefit Alibaba and other online malls, such as **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **58.com** ([WUBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WUBA)).


EMarketer, which tracks online commerce, says China is the world's biggest retail e-commerce market, estimating that it will account for just over 40% of global retail e-commerce sales this year.


On Nov. 11 alone, Alibaba raked in \$14.3 billion in the online shopping frenzy known as Singles' Day, an Alibaba creation that has far surpassed Cyber Monday as the world's biggest online shopping event.


**Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) and **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) are among U.S. companies already selling to Chinese consumers through Alibaba. Other goods — such as apples from Washington state, seafood from Alaska and Ben & Jerry's ice cream — have also fared well in trials on Alibaba's TMall.com, according to news reports.


**Big Opportunities**


Goldman Sachs, in a 2015 report entitled "The Rise of China's New Consumer Class," said only 11% of China's population has reached the middle class.


"As their ranks swell, so will their effect on the global economy," Goldman said, adding, "There will be huge opportunities for the entertainment, food service, technology and other industries" able to understand Chinese consumer tastes and align pricing and product offerings accordingly.


Cross-border purchases by China's online shoppers rose from less than \$2 billion in 2010 to more than \$20 billion in 2014, with the U.S. the destination of choice for clothing, personal care items and baby products, Bloomberg said April 21, citing eMarketer.


Most Chinese consumers who engaged in cross-border shopping did so because they thought foreign merchants could assure better quality amid concerns about counterfeit goods on Chinese websites, eMarketer said on Sept. 22, citing the China Internet Network and Information Center.


Alibaba itself has been hit by accusations that it hosts merchants selling fake goods, which prompted Ma to promise to eliminate counterfeits from the site.

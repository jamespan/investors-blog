  Sector Rotation In 2016: Why Gold, Steel, Oil, Coal Played Leading Roles

The term "sector rotation" has cropped up a great deal over the past five weeks.


And with good reason. The combination of the surprise election of Donald Trump as president and the looming certainty of an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve launched a passel of rallies ranging from coal to savings and loans.


But sector rotation was already well underway before the election.


Sector rotation is a byproduct of institutional investors altering their focus within the market. This most often occurs gradually, over the span of weeks or months, as cyclical industries begin to turn up or down and as opportunities arise in a changing economic landscape.

By the end of the third quarter, a number of long-mending industries were beginning to show strength.


Steel stocks were cycling up in [a year that has seen profit return](https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/steel-stocks-surge-on-trump-but-will-idle-plants-reboot/) across much of the industry, asserting its influential effect on coal miners, ore miners and transportation. U.S. chemical producers built on a vast boom fueled by cheap gas prices. And energy plays had been climbing since January, as that industry moves toward what forecasters expect to be a balancing of supply and demand heading into 2017.


As an industry group, steel makers rallied 43% through Nov. 7. The rally gained added life after the election, sending the group up 114% through Wednesday.


The pre-election action had pushed aside some, but not all, of the sectors that had started the year in leading roles.  At the end of 2015, Internet, Office Supplies, Software and Building stocks all ranked in the top five among [33 sectors tracked by IBD](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-dec-14-2016/).


At the end of the third quarter, Chips, Electronics, Internet and Computer were four of the five top sectors.


Mining, which ranked dead last at the end of 2015, was No. 1.


A rally in gold prices beginning in early January sent gold mining stocks soaring. Mining crept to the No. 31 slot among industries by the end of January. By the end of February, the gold-miners industry group had rallied 28% since Dec. 31. Ore miners — the other mining-sector industry — were down 4.7%.


At the end of March, Mining had seized the top slot among sectors.


The Nov. 8 elections stirred the pot by reversing many expectations and pointing to opportunities where, a day earlier, there appeared to be none. That, combined with expectations of a Fed rate hike, quickly shifted Banks and Savings and Loans into the current top sector slots.


Coal producers, part of IBD's Energy sector, had tumbled 27% in the first two months of the year. Coal stocks as a group would turn to rally 55% by Nov. 7, and 88% through Dec. 15 — aided by the election of the aggressively pro-coal Donald Trump.


The domestic oil and gas producers industry group rallied 39% for the year to Nov. 7, and 46% to Dec. 15. Despite those advances, energy remained the year's least active sector — ranking No. 32 at the start of the year and No. 29 at the end of Q3. By Thursday, it had climbed only to No. 25.


Many investors and analysts mistakenly use the terms "sector" and "industry" interchangeably. But this year's action within the energy group shows how there can, at times, be significant industry rotation without driving full-on sector rotation.


Sectors are portions of the economy made up of multiple, related industry groups. Industry groups are groups of stocks that tend to have similar operations, products and markets. You can find out how IBD's 197 industries are divided among 33 sectors by using the [Find Your Group's Sector](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/find-your-groups-sector/) page.


The current breadth of leadership paints a positive picture heading into 2017. But it is also telling that, although there is much optimism toward opportunities tied to the presidential election, IBD's Sector Leaders — the most demanding screen at Investors.com for leading stocks — has revealed only two leaders since the start of December. At the end of 2015, six stocks ranked as Sector Leaders.


The big money is still moving. New opportunities are being forged.

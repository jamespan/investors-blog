Most stocks will form bases during market declines, and the way the market corrects has a lot to do with how those bases will end up shaping.

Take a modest market correction, and most bases from that period will be flat bases. Take a full-fledged bear market, and expect to find a lot of deep, cup-like bases.

Indeed, the severity of each market decline acts as the mold for the bases that emerge from the decline. That's a factor that investors must take into account as they study chart patterns. A base that may seem flawed could be acceptable when it is put in the context of the broad market.

In 2013 and 2014, the market had several modest corrections. The Nasdaq never declined more than 11% in those two years.

So, it was no surprise that the flat base and the base-on-base — two patterns known for their shallow shapes — were so common in the past two years.

In a flat base, the stock declines no more than 15%. In a base-on-base, the second pattern is often a flat base.

Bear markets can produce deep bases with declines of 40%, 50% or even more. Yet that can be normal when the main indexes have plunged more than 20%, the standard definition of a bear market.

Remember, growth stocks tend to correct 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times more than the indexes. Thus, a 20% market drop could easily produce bases of 40% to 50%.

The 2008-09 bear market saw plenty of examples of absurdly deep bases that still generated successful breakouts.

For example, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) suffered a decline of nearly 60% as it plummeted to a January 2009 low **(1)**.

That year's recovery helped the personal technology company build the right side of its base in about a half-year's time. The stock formed a handle and broke out the week ending July 17 at 146.50. Volume picked up sharply the next week **(2)**.

The stock's handle also could have been interpreted as a flat base, since it fit the profile of that base as well.

Shares climbed with little difficulty until September 2012, when Apple's next major correction began.

Online retailer **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Chinese Internet search engine **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and chipmaker **Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)) were other leading stocks that formed excessively deep bases but still went on to make substantial gains from their breakouts.

In 1998, a double-dip in the market gave rise to a few bases that formed deeper-than-normal handles.

In a seven-week skid from July to early September, the Nasdaq was gashed for a 27% loss. The composite recovered not even half that loss when it started sinking 23% in just two weeks. But after that wave of selling subsided, the Nasdaq went on a prolific advance through the end of 1999.

During this upheaval, **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) formed a cup pattern with a decline of almost 40% from July to September, and the next month formed a handle that drooped 27%.

That was more than double what a proper handle's decline should be. Yet compared with the Nasdaq's action in that period, the handle wasn't so out of line.

The discount brokerage soared more than 400% until it went into a climax run and topped in April 1999.

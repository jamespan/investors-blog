The L-shape pattern features a sharp fall, a feeble rebound attempt, and a clear entry point for those courageous enough to act on the speculation that a former winner has more room to drop in price.

In other words, if you have an interest in short selling to win extra profits during market corrections, you might want to get to know this "construction" of investing fear and greed.

IBD's research on this relatively new discovery of investor behavior, first noted by Scott O'Neil, CEO of IBD's holding company Data Analysis, is still scant. But we will continue to assemble and analyze enough examples that hopefully will shed more light on the characteristics of this important pattern for short sellers.

For now, let's analyze how former medical stock leader Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which later acquired **Bausch Health** ([BHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BHC)) in 2013, formed one after its August 2015 peak near 263.

## Short Selling To Win: The L-Shape Pattern Set-Up

As the accompanying daily chart shows, notice how Valeant had risen briefly above the key 50-day moving average **(1)**, but on Sept. 21 the stock closed sharply lower and below the support line. Such action usually means that after a big price run, a stock has topped and is prone to showing more price weakness.

The L-shape took little time to form. From Sept. 21 to 29, Valeant plunged 38% in the space of seven sessions from an Sept. 21 high of 245.82 to a low of 152.94. Mathematically speaking, Valeant needed to rally 61% just to return to that recent high of 245.82.

It never came close.

Instead, the stock gained sharply for three days, rising 18% to as high as 182.64. But that was it. Valeant then swam within a relatively narrow price channel of 160 to 180 over the next couple weeks. An L-shape was born. The horizontal part formed in 15 days. Heavy selling resumed.

If you had sold shares short as Valeant rumbled past the 152.94 low of its four-week L-shape pattern in the week ended Oct. 23, 2015, you could have taken a 20% to 25% gain in the same week. Shares plunged more than 34% that week in monster volume **(2)**. On Oct. 19, the company reported strong growth in third-quarter earnings and sales, but management noted it would reduce its focus on older drugs that depend more on price increases amid public furor over high drug prices.

The next day, Valeant slid 10% to 146.74 in huge turnover, triggering the short sale at 152.84, a dime below the L-shape's low.

## Short Selling To Win: When To Cover The Position

Wait a few more days after the news, and you could have covered the short near 80 on Nov. 5 **(3)** for a 91% profit in 13 days' work.

In IBD's Oct. 20 edition, the ethical drug firm's Composite Rating was a flailing 67, despite a golden 98 EPS Rating. The RS was 33, Accumulation/Distribution a D.

## More L-Shape Pattern Examples

**Dillard's** ([DDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDS)) formed an L-shape pattern that was hardly as deep as the one by Valeant. Yet the look of the chart was similar. From April 24 to May 15, 2015, the department store chain dropped 19% from 138.26 to as low as 112.30. To recover those losses, Dillard's had to rally 23%. Instead, it just gained 6.1% over a 12-day span.

On June 5, Dillard's fell 2% in heavy volume and triggered a short sale. By August, shares slipped below 90, a gain of nearly 25%.

**First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) sank 16% (from 70.29 to 59) in 14 days from March 30 to April 18, 2016.

Over the next seven days, it rebounded only 6%. The stock triggered a short-sale entry at 58.90, and slid 21% to 46.67 in less than four weeks.

**Papa John's** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)) needed 10 weeks to make an L-shape pattern in late 2015. The stock dropped 28% from 74.52 to 53.65, rebounded no more than 10%, then smashed the bottom of the L with a hearty sell-off that began on Jan. 6, 2016.

Former tech star Lucent Technologies formed an L in July-August of 2000. Lucent plunged 41% from 62.91 to 37.10, rebounded just 14%, then broke down again. By year's end, it hit a low of 12.19.

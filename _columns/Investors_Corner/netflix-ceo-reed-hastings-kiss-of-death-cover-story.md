_Third In A Series_

Suppose you saw **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) CEO Reed Hastings on the cover of Fortune in its Dec. 6, 2010, edition and you owned shares in this big winner during the 2009-2010 run-up.

The radiant red cover showed Hastings sitting comfortably in jeans on a tan leather chair and grinning like a high school senior on prom night. After all, the biweekly magazine chose him "The 2010 Business Person of the Year."

Would it have been smart to sell your shares that same day?

With 20-20 hindsight, well, yes. And partly no.

At the end of November — around the time the magazine hit the newsstands and got zapped into tablet PCs, the pioneering movie rental firm traded at 205.90. On Wednesday, the stock was licking its wounds near 80.

The Netflix example reaffirmed how magazine covers often reflect the state of investor psychology after a stock has already made outsized gains. It can serve as a valuable contrarian indicator, helping you to grow cautious and begin looking for clear topping signals in the stock as media attention hits a frothy peak.

Magazine cover stories tend to be sensational. That's the nature of the business. To sell lots of copies, publishers need a big story.

So when a company like Netflix has grown many times in revenue, profits and stock price, and has effectively turned an industry upside down, it grabs magazine editors by the ears. A reporter spends weeks, maybe months, getting quotes, details, anecdotes — anything to scribe a fabulous piece.

But by that time, the stock is already saturated with investors. The best fund managers, keenly aware of the hype, are positioning to lock in their gains even as demand for shares remains strong.

Netflix continued to rally another seven months after the cover story. That's why knowing to spot topping signals is so beneficial. In 12 days from June 23 to July 11, the stock soared from 250 to 300 **1**. Such climax runs are a key sell signal. On July 13, the stock hit a high of 304.79 but reversed in heavy volume. Two weeks later, it dived below the 10-week moving average near 270 and never recovered **2**.

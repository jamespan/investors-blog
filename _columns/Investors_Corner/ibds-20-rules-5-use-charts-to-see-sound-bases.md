_Fifth in a series_

In just about every task, you're going to need the right tool to get the job done correctly.

Just as doctors and contractors have specific tools for their respective fields, investors have a wide array of tools with which to make key decisions. One of the most important tools: stock charts.

Poring over financial statements, or trade journals can tell you what to buy, but they won't tell you when. Timing and precision can make all the difference. Only charts help you time buys and sells.

A stock chart is a vital picture of a stock's trading history. The price bars in the upper panel show a stock's high, low and closing prices. The bottom panel shows a stock's volume â€” the number of shares traded. The most useful time frames for a chart are daily, weekly, monthly and intraday.

A company can have good fundamentals, but its stock may already be extended or is just not ready to move. Remember, it's what the market thinks of it that counts.

IBD research has found at least seven price patterns or bases that, when cleared in heavy volume, can be the launching pad to big gains. They include the cup with handle, double bottom, flat base, high tight flag and ascending base.

Each pattern must conform to specific criteria. A flat base must be at least five weeks long and the correction must be less than 15%.

Sound patterns are generally early stage, have prior uptrends of at least 20% or 30% and have overall tight action. The chart should show more evidence of accumulation than distribution.

Turnover should be at least 40% to 50% above average when the stock breaks out from a base. Also, investors should not buy once a stock gets more than 5% past its proper buy point. Buying extended stocks is a bad idea as you can easily get shaken out on any pullback.

**Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)) broke out from an 11-week flat base Feb. 2, 2005 **1**. The steelmaker met the five-week minimum and the correction was 13%. Volume swelled 364% above average that day **2**, leaving no doubt that a breakout occurred. Tenaris surged 34% by early March before making a sharp yet brief pullback **3**. It went on to rally 180% through October that year.

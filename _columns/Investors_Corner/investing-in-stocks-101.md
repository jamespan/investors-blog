Let's get started.


Investing In Stocks 101: Getting Started
----------------------------------------


Based on your investment objectives, you'll have to make some decisions about your potential investments.


Active investors may seek to trade stocks. Stocks are short or long-term investments in individual companies. Compared with bonds and options, stocks hold the greatest potential returns. Yet they also carry a significant amount of risk. Just like bonds and options, the price of a stock can go to zero.


For a more passive investor, [exchange traded funds](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/) (ETFs) may be the best fit. ETFs track a specific index. For example, the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies in the Nasdaq composite.


Meanwhile, other passive investors may decide mutual funds are optimal. Mutual funds pool money from investors and use that money to buy holdings for its portfolio. As an investor, you own shares in the mutual fund. The fund's portfolio managers take care of all the investment decisions. For that privilege, the fund company charges an annual management fee to fund shareholders.


Financial advisors who sell mutual funds also may add a sales charge or commission, often called a load. However, brokerages are increasingly selling mutual funds that have no load. They are called no-load funds.


An example of a top growth mutual fund is the [Fidelity Contrafund](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/investment-strategies-fidelity-will-danoff-2018-stock-market-trends/) (FCNTX). The Boston-based mutual fund is a large-cap growth fund that focuses on stocks with strong fundamental metrics.


Once you have determined your ideal investment choice, the next step is to select a brokerage firm.


How To Select A Brokerage Firm
------------------------------


Every year, Investor's Business Daily surveys investors to discern the [Best Online Brokers](https://www.investors.com/best-online-brokers/). The survey uses the brokerage firm's own customers to see which firms are performing best.


In the beginning of 2018, Fidelity Investments earned IBD's award of top overall brokerage firm by scoring the highest Customer Experience Index rating. Other high-quality brokers were **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)), TradeStation, **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) and **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)).


Be sure to research the brokers for characteristics most pertinent to you. Active, self-guided investors might focus on the best stock-trading tools. Other investors may seek the lowest fees. Or they may want to get the best investment and retirement planning tools.


More tech-savvy investors may check out zero-fee [stock trading app](https://www.investors.com/news/robinhood-stock-trading-app-user-growth-clearing/) Robinhood. Its user growth continues to accelerate with 5 million users in July. The privately-held firm is [considering an IPO](https://www.investors.com/news/robinhood-app-ipo-free-stock-crypto-trading/) and is valued at \$5.6 billion.


How To Find Stocks To Buy And Watch
-----------------------------------


[IBD's Stock Lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) serve as a great launching off point for investors. The stock lists cover a broad array of potential stock ideas, from initial public offerings (IPOs) to large-cap growth stocks.


The [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) showcases a list of 50 leading growth stocks with strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals.


The [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) focuses on top-rated big-cap growth stocks that look to deliver strong returns without the volatility of smaller growth stocks.


The [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) highlights the stock market's newest companies. The IPO Leaders has special screening criteria to find up-and-coming stocks with strong fundamental and technical traits.


How To Invest In Stocks
-----------------------


Investor's Business Daily recommends [buying stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) when they are "[breaking out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/)" above a [risk-optimal buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But not all stocks are created equal. [Investors should focus](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) on companies with strong quarterly and annual earnings growth.



Meanwhile, many stock market winners have something new. For example, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL))'s game-changing iPod, iPhone and iPad led to a big advance from 2004 to 2012. Apple broke out again in January 2017, this time clearing a 118.12 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [perfect cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).


But the work isn't over once you buy a stock, you'll need to have an exit plan for when things go right — and wrong.


How To Sell Stocks
------------------


It's critical to always have a plan to get in and out of a stock investment. Before you place a stock trade, you should have an idea when you will sell a stock. Plan your trade and trade your plan.


From IBD's perspective, most upside gains should be taken around the [20%-25% profit-taking range](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/). Typically, growth stocks tend to advance 20% to 25% after breaking out of a proper base, then decline and set up a new base. Rather than sitting through the decline, it is often better to take profits and wait for a new base formation.


On the downside, if a stock [falls more than 7%-8%](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) from your initial purchase, [you should cut your losses](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) to avoid more significant losses. At that point, the stock is clearly not performing as expected and should be removed from the portfolio.

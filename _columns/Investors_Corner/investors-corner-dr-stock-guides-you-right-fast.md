Anything that can save you some time and make your day a bit easier is a welcomed relief. Nowhere is this more true than in your relentless search for great stocks.

  

IBD can help. The Stock Checkup feature at Investors.com will speed your research.

  

From the home page, click on Stock Research, then Stock Checkup. You will be prompted to enter a stock ticker. Plug in CPX for **Complete Production Services** ([CPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPX)), an oilfield services provider.

  

The first thing you'll see is the Stock Doctor, pointing to this stock's Composite Rating, 83. Is that good? Let's see.

  

Just below the good doctor lies the heading "Performance Within Group (CPX)." Now you'll see a series of color-coded bars. Treat these as you would a traffic signal. Green means good to go. Yellow means caution, slow down. Red means stop.

  

Complete Production Services' Composite Rating warrants a yellow light; an 83 is OK, just not great. True, this stock ranks third within this group by this all-encompassing gauge. Within the bar you'll see 94%. This means Complete Production Services beats out 94% of its group mates.

  

There are four more bars in this section, one each for EPS Rating, RS Rating, SMR Rating and Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

  

So what do you see so far? Colors. What better way to quickly give you a picture of this stock?

  

Are you curious which other stocks in the group may be better than Complete Production? Better how? Perhaps by Composite Rating. Move your mouse so your cursor sits upon the Composite Rating bar. To the right you'll see that group's five best stocks by Composite Rating.

  

To check which stocks in this group have the highest EPS Rating, move your mouse to the colored bar and look to the right. Voila.

  

You can do this with each of these five IBD ratings.

  

Now scroll even lower. Do not miss IBD Stock Checklist. Using the same color codes, the most crucial elements that influence Complete Production Services are staring you in the face.

  

This is a huge timesaver for you.

  

Complete Production has several flaws that show up in this feature. See the red dot next to Industry Group Rank? Oilfield services is a weak group, and that's a serious problem.

  

Red Dot No. 2: number of quarters of accelerating earnings. You want to see at least one. Complete Production has none. Red Dot No. 3: consecutive years of annual EPS growth. One is not enough.

  

Red Dots No. 4, 5 and 6 all have to do with annual sales growth, margin and return on equity.

  

The doctor says Complete Production has some work to do.

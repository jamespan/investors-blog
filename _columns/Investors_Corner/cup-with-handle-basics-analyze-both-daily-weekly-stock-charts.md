If you are an experienced, mindful driver, you simply don't just look at what's right ahead. You probably also make a habit of glancing at what may emerge 10 to 15 seconds down the road. In other words, you also try to take in the overall scene.


In [successful growth stock investing](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), you can get similar up-close and big-picture views through [daily and weekly stock charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY). It's best to study both types of charts, because what one shows, the other may not.


Ignoring one or the other is a bad idea. That's a bit like staring only at what's right in front of your car — or taking in only the big picture while driving and missing key details.


For rookie investors, stock charts initially might look intimidating. They don't have to be. The more you use them, the more value you will get in terms of market intelligence. The more you will discover the current level of demand vs. supply in a given stock. This knowledge gives the individual investor and the professional trader a clear advantage.


Here are a few quick basics on using charts. In daily charts, each bar represents one day of trading activity. The top of the bar marks the day's high, while the bottom marks that day's low.


In weekly charts, each bar typically represents five days' worth of trading. If the market is closed for a holiday, the weekly price and volume bars simply mark four days' of trading action.


Each bar's top marks that week's high; the bottom, that week's low. In both types, the hash mark across each bar signals the closing price.


The weekly chart is the one that provides the broader view. It tends to smooth out the price action, cutting out much of the noise that you find in a daily chart.


It also gives you more history so you can see a stock's longer-term trends. On a weekly chart you're likelier to spot a base that's several months to more than a year long.


With weekly charts, you can perhaps more quickly see if a consolidation is shorter than ideal. Most bases need a full seven weeks to form, such as a [proper cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) or a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/). Remember to start counting with the first down week after a high.


Moreover, you'll be able to tell if a stock is forming a late-stage base, which is a riskier pattern, when you study a weekly chart. It could be impossible to see that a stock's doing this if you look at just its daily chart.


So what are daily charts good for?


Use them to see when a stock has gapped up or down. A gap up in price is a bullish sign; the intraday low is higher than the intraday high of the previous session, thus generating a positive price gap. A gap down is a negative sign.


In addition, use daily charts to identify precise buy points.


Some handles might not show up on a weekly chart, so you could miss out on seeing some handle buy points.


![ic_clr_013117](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IC_clr_013117.png)Remember that the minimum length for any handle is five days. If a handle takes shape over five sessions that span two different weeks, it might not show up on a weekly chart.


Check the five-day handle formed by May 2007 IPO **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)) in September 2007 **(1)**.


Notice how this handle and thus its 18.30 buy point weren't apparent if you were studying only a weekly chart **(2)**.


From Sept. 20 to 26, Continental drifted lower for five sessions. The heavy volume during each day is unusual for a good handle. On the other hand, the decline of 7% from the highest point to the lowest point fell within the normal range, and the handle itself showed a downward slant along its lows. It was a proper final shakeout ahead of the Sept. 27 breakout in which the stock surged 8% to 18.38, rising past the proper entry in volume that jumped 136% above its average.


Average turnover at the time was only 259,000 shares over the prior 50 sessions. Certainly, that added some risk to the investor. However, some fantastic new IPOs start their big price runs while trading less than the ideal minimum of 400,000 or 500,000 shares a day.


Plus, Continental scored a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- on a scale of A (indicating heavy accumulation by funds) to E (heavy distribution, or selling). The rating takes 13 weeks' worth of daily price-and-volume action into account. The 83 Composite Rating offset a mediocre 66 EPS Rating and was not bad for a new issue; keep in mind that many new public companies have a younger history of profit growth.


The Enid., Okla., firm emerged as one of the finest energy growth stocks during the tail end of the 2003-to-2007 bull market. The oil and gas exploration and production firm stock rallied to a peak of 83.81 by July 2008, a 358% gain from the proper 18.30 buy point, forming a base-on-base pattern along the way.

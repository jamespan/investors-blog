IBD's chief goal is to help investors identify and buy top-notch growth stocks just as they begin their big advances.


Stocks typically enjoy their biggest gains within the first several years after their initial public offerings. That's why IBD launched the [IPO Leaders screen](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) in January 2014, which focuses on stocks that have listed their shares in the past three years. Published on Tuesday and Thursday, IPO Leaders features up to 16 minicharts and a column highlighting stocks showing the most promise. Be sure to read the market analysis at the bottom of each chart.


**WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)),  a maker of plant-based beverages and dairy products under brands such as Silk, Horizon Organic and Land O Lakes, was among the big winners flagged in the screen before its breakout. Others included **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) and **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)).


These stocks have all offered innovative products or services that have either created new niches or taken market share away from competitors.


WhiteWave went public at 17 on Oct. 26, 2012, as a spinoff from **Dean Foods** ([DF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DF)). It has benefited from acquisitions that have helped it meet growing demand for healthier food.


The stock was featured several times as it shaped a long base from November 2014 to January last year.  In fact, it appeared in the IPO Leaders screen on Feb. 10, 2015, just two days before WhiteWave cleared a 36.67 double bottom buy point, gapping up 7% in volume that jumped 159% above average. At the time, the chart analysis noted that the stock had just retaken its 10-week line. The stock's Composite Rating was decent at 88, and its 91 Earnings Per Share Rating reflected strong earnings growth.


Over the next six months, WhiteWave ran up 43% to a peak of 52.53 on Aug. 5.


Investing in IPO stocks can be tricky, especially with those that have little price or volume history. IPO bases can be shorter than a typical flat base or cup-shaped base, which must form over a minimum period of at least five weeks and six weeks, respectively.


Because they're short, IPO bases can also be hard to notice, and they also carry more risk than conventional bases because many have little or no history of price and volume action. Some also have little earnings history on which to evaluate their fundamentals and determine fair value for the shares.


Examining SEC filings such as the 424(b) document submitted ahead of a company’s IPO provides a description of the company’s business, earnings data, risk factors and other key information. Also, by scrutinizing both the daily and weekly charts of stocks that have shaped IPO bases, investors can get a sense of price and volume trends.


"The safest time to buy an IPO is on the breakout from its first correction and base-building area," IBD founder William J. O'Neil said in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "Once a new issue has been trading in the market for one, two, or three months or more, you have valuable price and volume data that you can use to better judge the situation.”

IBD's [New Highs List](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) can provide individual investors with a pool of buy candidates. Stocks often reach a new high as they break out of a consolidation.


There's another way, though, to use the new highs/new lows data. Treat it as a secondary stock market indicator. Sometimes it can serve as a kind of a canary in the coal mine, either [foretelling or confirming a correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-read-signs-stock-market-bear/).


"Sometimes" is the keyword here. Secondary indicators are called secondary because they don't always work.


Let's look at several stock-market uptrends that ran for 50 or more consecutive sessions.


**September to October 2010**: The market was in an uptrend. New highs were running sometimes as high as 350 and never dipping under 100 for more than two consecutive sessions.


But Nov. 16, the indexes delivered fewer than 100 combined new highs (NYSE plus Nasdaq) a third day in a row. This had not happened during the entire 51-session run. The Market Pulse shifted to correction.


The new-highs tally had signaled a change in character.


New Highs: What's That Canary Doing?
------------------------------------


**December 2011 to February 2012**: An [uptrend that was confirmed Dec. 20, 2011](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-random-walk-time-the-stock-market-bottom/), ran for 67 sessions. But the new highs/new lows data wasn't particularly useful. The new highs tally stayed fairly low throughout the rally.


If the canary doesn't normally chirp much, it's hard to spot the change in character.


**July to September 2012**: The uptrend confirmed July 26, 2012, ran for 52 days. Once again, the new-high tally was too restrained to be useful.


**December 2016 to February 2017**: The uptrend confirmed Dec. 7, 2016, lasted 70 days. This rally had many days of huge new-high tallies and strayed into two digits only on isolated occasions. Yet, the new highs tally wasn't useful in the canary role. There were times the market came under pressure, but the situation never degraded into a correction.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IC043018-300x161.jpg)August 2017 to February 2018**: On Aug. 22, 2017, a new uptrend was confirmed. The run lasted 112 sessions. The new-highs tally was in three digits throughout the run, dropping to two digits never more than two days in a row.


That changed beginning Feb. 2, when new highs in two digits became common. On Feb. 8, the fifth consecutive session in two digits, the Market Pulse changed to correction.


The key is to pay attention to new highs. Sometimes they will signal a change in character.


What About Now?
---------------


In August 2019, new highs have swung back and forth indecisively.  On Aug. 1, new highs rolled in at 289 but failed to match that total every subsequent day in August through Aug. 23.


Watch to see if the market can deliver a new highs total in the coming weeks. A surge above the Aug. 1 tally could signal that bullishness either has or will return to the stock market.

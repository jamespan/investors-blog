IPO bases sometimes form quickly and are easy to miss.

  

But those who failed to latch on to **YY's** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) breakout from its initial cup-like base didn't have to wait long for a second chance to buy a stock that became one of last year's biggest winners.

  

IBD has recently launched an IPO Leaders column (today on Page B7) to alert readers to promising new stocks as early as possible after they've gone public.

  

YY operates a social networking platform that lets users communicate through voice, text and video. Users can also play games, watch shows and even participate in meetings.

  

The stock went public in November 2012 at 10.50 a share. It cleared its IPO base — a 10-week consolidation with a 15.37 buy point — on Feb. 14, 2013. Volume was 72% above normal, higher than the 40% jump you'd like to see on a breakout.

  

But the Chinese social media stock was thinly traded and hadn't attracted much attention. It hadn't yet appeared in columns such as Stock Spotlight, the Research Table Review or IBD 50.

  

But investors who had been looking through the top five sectors in IBD's stock research tables may have noticed that YY appeared in bold on the day of its breakout, indicating that it had hit a new high in strong volume.

  

That was a clue that something was afoot.

  

The table showed that YY's fundamentals were respectable and included a 77 Composite Rating, an 80 Earnings Per Share Rating and an 87 Relative Price Strength rank. YY's Internet-Content industry group was rising quickly, going to No. 56 from No. 111 in just three weeks.

  

YY quickly rose 36% from its IPO base **(1)**. It began getting more attention in IBD features as the stock and its industry group showed steady improvement.

  

YY got covered in IBD articles on March 12, 2013, following a better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings report. Then the April 3 International Leaders column featured the stock when it found support at its 50-day moving average. The story cited the company's fast earnings and sales growth.

  

In fact, YY was in the midst of building a new base at the time.

  

The stock broke out above a 20.99 buy point of an eight-week cup-without-handle base on May 6, 2013, in volume that was among the highest since the stock went public **(2)**.

  

On that day, YY appeared in the Nasdaq Stocks On The Move table, which flags stocks that are rising or falling in unusually high volume. Meanwhile, its Composite Rating had risen to 90; the RS had climbed to 94. Also, the Internet sector jumped to No. 2 out of 33, and the Internet-Content subgroup had climbed to No. 8 out of 197 IBD industry groups.

  

From its breakout, YY soared 433% to a record high of 90.93 on March 6 of this year. The stock is now fashioning a new base.

Here's a short list of short lists of leading stocks.


In May 2003, Investor's Business Daily launched the IBD 100. The feature each week zeroed in on 100 leading stocks — the best of the best among leaders, aimed at saving investors time by culling stocks with healthy fundamentals and chart action from the daily NYSE and Nasdaq listings.


After much careful study, IBD tightened the list to the IBD 50 in January 2011. This more-refined offering had carefully explored which stocks among the eight years of IBD 100 lists tended to show the best performance.


Keeping the strong, discarding the weak, IBD has concentrated its list down to even more fine-tuned leadership. The list is now published twice a week, on Monday and on Wednesday.


The list continues to offer IBD's proprietary minicharts, jammed with critical fundamental and technical information on each stock, not the least of which are chart descriptions, including buy points and critical sell signals.


As with any stock offering, readers should never buy a stock simply because it appears on the IBD 50. Remember, the IBD 50 is not a buy list. Treat it as a key watch list. You should always analyze the chart pattern, dig deeper into the fundamentals and read articles about the company to understand fully what sets it apart from the thousands of also-rans that populate the stock market.


Here are a few of the list's current offerings, and when they first appeared on the list.


**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) showed up on the IBD 50 list in February last year, as it carved through its first real base. The cup showed a 33% decline, the deepest allowed for a good cup base. The designer of chips that go into wearable cameras broke out at 13.52 in massive volume in March and ran up 170% to a Jan. 7, 2014, high of 36.49.


**Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) was an IBD 50 play the week that it cleared a cup-with-handle base on May 22, 2013. A nine-month advance, up to just before its current modest consolidation, carried it 193% above that buy point.


**FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) joined the IBD 50 crew as it was basing in early August 2012. It broke out from that base two weeks later, launching a run that would drive shares up 199% over the next 15 months.


**Generac Holdings** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) was in the IBD 50 in July 2012 while forming the first tenable base amid a volatile advance. The portable and backup power generator manufacturer snapped out of the nine-week base in October, receiving an added boost from the heavens as Superstorm Sandy slammed into the East Coast — knocking out power and driving up demand for generators.


The stock tore out of a cup-with-handle base with a 24.44 buy point Oct. 1. By Nov. 5 it had climbed 60%. More recently, Generac notched a new high Monday, 144% above the initial entry.

Let's say you've mastered the art of spotting the cup and [cup-with-handle patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/broadening-the-focus-long-term-cup-with-handle-bases/), and you're getting comfortable with the [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-flat-base-power-waiting-to-erupt/) and [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/).

Way to go. Those [common base patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), seen among the biggest stock market winners, are likely to come in handy.

But there are other chart patterns that investors should familiarize themselves with.

Today we'll focus on the ascending base, a rare pattern that can lead to big gains if you learn to spot it correctly and buy at the right time.

## What An Ascending Base Looks Like

The ascending base may be tougher to spot because it has more moving parts. The pattern often takes shape as a stock tries to rise during a choppy or tired market. But once a strong uptrend takes hold in the broader market, the stock has the potential to break out to new highs.

An ascending base typically starts forming after a stock has already staged a prior breakout and gained at least 20% -- so it's usually not a first-stage pattern. As with other bases, you'd ideally see a strong prior advance on the stock's chart.

So what does an ascending base look like? It consists of a series of three pullbacks, each ranging from about 10% to 20% from the most recent high to low. Each of the pullbacks must mark a higher high and a higher low — thus, the ascending base.

Because the pattern is created by three distinct pullbacks, it can take longer to form than most other bases, roughly nine to 16 weeks.

To get the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an ascending base, add 10 cents to the high of the third pullback, like you would with other IBD patterns.

Likewise, don't buy if it's [extended more than 5% past the proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/).

**Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) went on a tear in the late 1990s. It soared nearly 300% after clearing a cup base in January 1999 to the week ended May 14, then pulled back to its 10-week moving average over the next two weeks.

The stock found support at the line and continued higher before pausing in mid-July.

It then staged a series of three pullbacks, in August, September and October, to shape an ascending base.

Shares broke out past a 224.79 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in the week ended Nov. 5 in heavy volume, before taking off on a more-than-250% run to an early January 2000 peak.

Ahead of the breakout, the chip designer carried high ratings: 99 [Earnings Per Share](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/), 99 Relative Price Strength, and B Accumulation/Distribution.

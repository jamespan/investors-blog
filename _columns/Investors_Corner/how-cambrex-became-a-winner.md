When an industry gets hot, its success can spill over to other industries that provide it with raw materials, technology or services. For example, when commercial air travel started to take off in the 1950s, hotels also saw a big jump in business. These are known as cousin stocks: companies that might remain in obscurity had it not been for being the supplier of key components or technology for blockbuster products.


In 2015, **Cambrex** ([CBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBM)) took that role as a partner for pharmaceutical companies at a time when biotechs and other drugmakers won key regulatory approvals and their product pipelines swelled. That helped explain why this little-known small-cap company became one of the most successful stocks of the year, up nearly 150%.


At the beginning of the year, investors saw a sleepy Cambrex chart that had not gone anywhere for about a year. But everything changed on Feb. 6 **(1)**.


That day, the company reported a blowout fourth quarter in which sales jumped 26% vs. a year earlier to a record \$129.3 million. Earnings per share roared 78% higher. The news sparked a breakout past the 24.55 buy point of a flat base.


The breakaway gap meant that since demand was so strong, it was still acceptable to buy shares, even if they closed that day 22% above the buy point. This was an extraordinary display of institutional demand that could not be ignored. So in such a case, try to buy as close as possible to the opening price, which in this case was 28.


The stock cruised higher with little difficulty until it started its second base in mid-April **(2).** The seven-week cup with handle gave investors another chance to buy.


Cambrex broke out June 3. It reported a 383% surge in EPS five weeks earlier. Volume was merely average on the breakout. Proper breakouts draw sharply higher volume, at least 40% to 50% above normal. Yet, Cambrex and several other winners of 2015 managed to make sizeable gains despite lackluster breakout volume initially.


Shares rose more than 30% from the 41.80 buy point. Pullbacks to the 10-week moving average in late June and late July merely got the stock settled down for a continued advance **(3).**


On Aug. 6, just a few days after another strong quarterly report, the stock started its most recent consolidation. But this base was deeper and choppier than the first two. There was a lot more activity below the 10-week line. It was, after all, the third base in the advance, and those tend to be less polished than earlier patterns.


The price consolidation started about the same time that the drug industry began to come under fire from politicians for some exorbitant drug prices. The biotech and ethical drug industry groups topped in July and early August.


By the time Cambrex reported Q3 results on Nov. 3, the stock was acting better. It was trending higher and spent much of November forming a smooth-shaped handle.


Shares topped the 52.68 buy point Nov. 25. Volume again was lackluster. Trading surged two sessions later on Nov. 30, but on that day the stock reversed after hitting new highs. Today, the stock is trading below the entry. There have been no sell signals, but the flaws of the third-stage base appear to be working against it. A struggling market is not helping either.

Before buying a stock, it's important to first check the underlying company's vitals. For instance, how are its earnings and sales? Are the year-over-year growth rates among the best in the industry? Are profit margins healthy? What about ROE?

Technical analysis also is a key component of successful investing. (This will be covered in detail in Thursday's column.) Clearly, it can take many hours to research all of the above, from poring over a company's financial statements to digging into its industry group to consulting the daily and weekly stock charts.

IBD's [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) can help save a lot of time. The proprietary tool at Investors.com provides key fundamental and technical data, charts and related articles. Of course, it should be used to supplement your own research.

To find out how a stock that you're interested in rates, go to the Investors.com home page and select "IBD Stock Checkup" by hovering your mouse on the Research tab. Enter a ticker symbol and click on the arrow.

**Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)) earns mostly top-notch ratings in its checkup. In fact, the electronic mortgage services provider earns the "Best in Group" designation for four of the five key ratings.

It scores a perfect 100% in the following ratings: Composite; Earnings per Share; Relative Strength; and Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity (SMR).

Ellie's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is also solid at 89%, good for 3rd place in the group, as seen on a list to the right as you hover over each ranking.

Scroll down for the general market outlook and industry group rank. On Tuesday, the market uptrend was still under pressure, and the Computer Software-Financial group was No. 9 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.

The next section provides detailed fundamental performance, including: the date of the company's next earnings report; EPS percentage change in the last quarter; number of quarters of EPS growth acceleration; and the earnings surprise percentage for the last quarter.

Ellie Mae checked out, as indicated by a green dot, on the seven points under current earnings, except in its estimated EPS percent change for the current quarter, which is flat. Its annual earnings are also a red flag, which means that investors should dig deeper.

Also in the fundamental performance section, see details about its SMR Rating. Ellie checks out in five of the six gauges.

Have a look at your trades over the past 12 months.

  

How many of those, if you hadn't sold, would still be gaining value?

  

If the answer is none or just one or two, you are right in the sweet spot. But if the answer is more than that, you might want to reassess how you apply your sell rules.

  

To be sure, most stocks, when sold correctly, will continue to gain ground for at least a short while. That is exactly what you want. It is a nearly impossible feat to sell precisely at the top of a stock run, so you'd rather sell into strength on the way up. This allows you a bit more control than trying to sell while a stock is coming apart as it tops and collapses.

  

But if you find yourself selling stocks during what turn out to be relatively brief pullbacks, or ones that reverse and continue their uptrends, then it's a good idea to look more closely at the stocks you sold and the sell signals on which you acted.

  

One stock sending sell signs, and which would have been hard to hold without already owning a serious profit cushion, was **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) in January 2010.

  

Baidu broke out of a flat base in heavy trade Jan. 14, 2010, two days after **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) announced it might pull operations from China due to censorship issues.

  

That would have left Baidu atop China's search engine market. But the stock gave back gains over the coming sessions, as the market came under pressure and as it became clear that Google was only contemplating an exit.

  

The market shifted from its confirmed uptrend status to "Uptrend under pressure" on Jan. 21, then to "Market in correction" status Jan. 25. Matters were complicated by the Hong Kong market, which has an impact on China-based stocks trading on U.S. markets. The Hang Seng index had already fallen into a steep decline that began Jan. 4.

  

Neither situation was, in itself, a sell signal. But they may have urged some investors to narrow their tolerances, to sell at 3% to 4%, rather than waiting for the standard 7%-to-8% automatic sell trigger.

  

Even so, Baidu fell almost 8% below its 44.42 buy point on Jan. 26. That may have been more than enough to coax investors to sell. Then it fell even further, cutting below the 8% automatic sell trigger point, on Jan. 29.

  

There was a difference here for investors who had bought during breakouts in July or September 2009, and those who had set up an initial position during the January 2010 breakout. January entrants really had no alternative other than to sell.

  

For those who had a cushion, an 8% slip below the buy point may be cause for trimming the most recent purchases, but not for selling the remainder of the position. The stock sent only one sell signal, related to its most recent base, and a 3% to 4% dip below 10-week support, with mild losses coming in light trade, was no cause for alarm.

  

Baidu retook its buy point Feb. 3 **(1)**, just as the Hong Kong market turned up into a two-month rally. But the U.S. market remained under the correction rubric until March 2, preventing most investors who exited at the 8% sell signal from repurchasing the stock.

  

Baidu climbed 253% from its January 2010 breakout to the beginning of a long-term correction in April the next year.

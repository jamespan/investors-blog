Owning well-established blue chips that generate slow but steady gains and dividends is one way to play the stock market.

But investors looking for a little more sizzle should be on the lookout for newer names with the potential for fast growth. Think of the N in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/), which stands for new products, new management, new companies — and even new highs.

Big caps such as **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)), **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)), all components of the Dow Jones industrial average, have a long history and tend to provide fairly stable profits as well as an income stream. They also have market caps near \$200 billion or higher, and have more than 2 billion shares outstanding.

What they don't usually offer, however, is a big run-up in stock price over a relatively short period. And most are cyclical — more subject to what's going on in the economy. The price performance this year for the three Dow stocks mentioned above ranges from -4% to a 9% gain. The overall Dow is up 7%.

By comparison, the Nasdaq composite, which tends to house newer, younger companies, has risen 13%. The S&P 500 is up 11%. So adding some newer stocks to your portfolio could help boost performance.

What's considered young?

IBD research has found that companies tend to make their biggest advance during the first several years after coming public. As a rule of thumb, a newer company is one that has been publicly traded for less than 15 years.

That's not to say an older company won't make a second big run. Most don't — but one exception is **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), 37 years old as a public company. The iPhone and iPad maker has had its share of ups and downs over the years, but has had a yet another revitalization: It's rallied over 40% this year.

New companies can create new markets, and those leaders can post enormous gains. Look at action camera maker **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)), up 200% from its June 26 debut. **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), which makes chips for GoPro cameras, has surged more than 730% since its October 2012 IPO.

More recently, a flurry of Chinese Internet stocks have surged amid the growth of the middle class in the Middle Kingdom. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)), which range from two months to nine years in age, have generated big gains for shareholders.

That's not to say you can pick any young stock and expect a big gain. Due diligence is necessary, as are the usual factors — the overall stock market, the economy, company fundamentals, and price and volume action. Also key: buying at the right time.

**Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) formed an IPO base soon after its Aug. 1 debut. Investors who got in at the 41.60 buy point would have enjoyed a 41% gain in two weeks **(1)** — triggering the eight-week hold rule for fast movers.

The stock has now pulled back into a new base. Those who bought at the entry still hold a high single-digit percentage gain, but anyone chasing the stock on its way up would now have a smaller gain, if not a loss.

Mobileye's technology goes into camera-based advanced driver assistance systems. Its technology is used in cars by most major automakers, and is thought to be in some new **Tesla Motors** ' ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) vehicles.

What makes a stock work or not work after it breaks out?


Factors we might consider include thin trade, a reversal below the buy point on the breakout, big volume, a retreat to the buy point, and accumulation or distribution in the base.


A case study might help weigh their impact.


IBD took a look at the breakouts that occurred in the first four weeks after the Sept. 1, 2010, follow-through day. The first four weeks are when many leaders emerge. And the autumn 2010 uptrend was a strong rally with many leaders breaking out.


For this review, we looked at stocks with a Composite Rating of 90 or better. We counted 49 breakouts, which involved several stocks that broke out more than once.


•Did being thinly traded (with average daily share volume less than 400,000) matter?


Yes. Fifteen breakouts were among thinly traded stocks. Four failed outright, and three others rose 14% or less above the buy point. A 14% run isn't as good as it sounds because a pyramid entry trims part of the gain, and no one can count on selling exactly at the top. Bottom line: Almost half of the thin stocks either failed or delivered hard-to-capture gains.


Among the non-thin breakouts, weak action was about half the rate (24% vs. 47%) found in thin stocks.


•Did closing below the buy point on the breakout day matter?


Yes, but not as much as some might guess. Nine of the 49 stocks closed under the entry on the breakout day. Three of the nine triggered the 8% sell rule after meager gains. Four rose 17% to 37%. Two were super gainers — 50% and 107%.


Compare that to the 40 breakouts that closed above the buy point. Nine triggered the 8% sell rule — a 23% failure rate vs. 33% for those with a weak first-day close.


Fourteen of the 40 were super gainers (up 50% or more). That's 35% vs. 22% for the weak starters.


So a weak start sometimes hurts, but it's not a reason to sell.


•Did big volume matter?


Yes, especially for stocks that did exceptionally well. Eighteen breakouts led to gains of 50% or more. Volume for those super gainers showed an average 152% spike on the breakout day.


•How many of the super gainers returned to or below the buy point after breaking out?


Nearly half, or eight, including one that triggered the 8% sell rule and then rebounded to big gains.


•How many super gainers showed accumulation or distribution in the base?


Only one of the 18 super gainers showed net weekly distribution in the base. Five showed neither distribution nor accumulation, and 12 showed net accumulation.


Only two stocks of the 49 breakouts had every factor right. They were **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), which rose 70% in three months, and **Amerigroup** ([AGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGP)), which gained 68% in six months.

**How To Spot A Fine Chart:** [Seventh In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/609681/201204301707/how-to-spot-a-fine-chart.aspx)

  

Not every base has a handle, yet many do.

  

This isn't a problem, it's a blessing. But first you must know what a proper handle looks like, and respect the risks raised with an improper handle.

  

A handle should reflect a stock's quiet time. It begins near the highest price within the base. Almost surely, the stock drew good volume and lots of attention as it neared some prior peak, but couldn't quite push through.

  

As impatient smaller investors unload, disappointed their stock didn't make new highs, the funds sit just below the market, their hands outstretched, palms facing up. They're catching the shares shaken loose by the weak hands.

  

So how does this story manifest itself on a chart? First you see a valid base, usually a cup or a double bottom. Somewhere on the right side, the incline stalls. Shares are sold, but with no panic. The movement ratchets lower over at least five days (or even months) without volume surges. That's the quiet shakeout.

  

The handle should appear in the base's upper half. To determine this, find the mathematical midpoint of the base (high plus low, then divided by 2) and the midpoint of the handle. The latter should be higher.

  

The handle's lows should slope lower, not higher. An up-wedging handle shows no shakeout, just more investors plowing in. You want to see weak hands exiting the stock, with fund support at successively lower levels.

  

Generally, the handle shouldn't sag more than 12%. While you're looking for a shakeout, the stock shouldn't be able to fall too hard. If the funds aren't there, why would you be interested?

  

**Xerox** ([XRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XRX)) was a youngster in 1963 when it formed a cup-with-handle from Jan. 7 through April 3. The stock was climbing the right side of a cup in the first half of March, but stalled at 164.13 **(1)**, 37 cents shy of the cup's peak.

  

Impatient longs sold out over the ensuing 14 sessions. Volume only picked up on the handle's first day, then quickly dried up.

  

Note how high the handle sits in the base. A high-volume breakout April 3 signaled Xerox was on its way. It rose 144% over the next seven months.

Want to do something with your cash but nervous about buying stocks in a choppy market? IBD's Big Cap 20 list, which appears every Tuesday, contains stocks that have minimum market capitalizations of \$15 billion. These stocks are less volatile than high-growth stocks like **Taser** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)), which can soar 10% one day and fall sharply the next.

  

The behemoths in the [Big Cap 20](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-big-cap-20.htm) are capable of producing steady — if not large — gains.

  

As with any IBD screen, there's an emphasis on stocks that have decent and stable profit growth over a three- to five-year period.

  

They also show price appreciation and sound chart patterns, and many of these stocks pay dividends.

  

Stocks that appear in the Big Cap 20 list week after week are the most promising. Check the stock analysis at the bottom of the weekly minicharts accompanying each stock to see which are forming bases or are in secondary buy areas. As with all stocks, avoid those that have risen more than 5% beyond their buy points in order to minimize risk.

  

And buy only when the Market Pulse, located on Page B8 in today's paper, shows that the market is in a confirmed uptrend.

  

Previous Big Cap 20 winners include **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)).

  

Another example is online travel stock **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), which appeared in the Big Cap 20 on April 15, 2013, as it was trying to clear a 727.10 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.

  

It also cleared an alternate entry at 745.10 in heavy volume during the week ended May 10.

  

The weekly minichart that accompanied Priceline's entry in the Big Cap 20 showed that the stock enjoyed a 96 Composite Rating and a 98 Earnings Per Share Rating, in line with the best growth stocks.

  

Profit growth was accelerating leading up to the breakout, climbing 25%, 26% and 35% in the three quarters through March 2013. Sales growth rose 17%, 20% and 26% during that span.

  

Priceline climbed to a high of 1,378 in the week ended March 7, 2014, a gain of about 90% in just 11 months.

  

The Big Cap 20 column offers more analysis, which may include commentary about the overall market and which industry sectors are showing strength.

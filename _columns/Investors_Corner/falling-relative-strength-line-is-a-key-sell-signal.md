**How To Sell Winners Like A Pro II:** [Seventh In A Series](http://news.investors.com/special-report/623411-sell-like-a-pro-ii-defense.aspx)

Let's say you're holding onto a big winner that's finally showing signs of breaking down.

You still like the stock and want to see if it can come back, but you wonder: When is it absolutely, positively time to sell?

This is the time to look at two key measures of a stock's health: the Relative Strength line and the Relative Price Strength Rating.

Consider these two signals the last exits on the highway â€” they may not help you get out at the top, but they can help you preserve a big chunk of your profits.

Sometimes, you might have ignored some sell signals in a great stock that's topped. Maybe the stock sank below its 10-week line in huge volume a few times. Or maybe it made a climax run, or new highs in thin trade.

In other cases, the stock may trade under its support line for several weeks, and on the weekly chart it looks like it may even test its 40-week moving average. You're still sitting on a big gain, so you can afford to hang on a bit longer. But, in the back of your mind, you know that high-growth stocks can crash as quickly as they soared.What to do?

Check the RS line. It compares a stock's price performance against the S&P 500. An upward-sloping line means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. The RS Rating rates a stock on a scale of 1 to 99, with 99 being best, relative to all other publicly traded companies.

When the RS line breaks down badly or the RS Rating dips below 70, it's typically time to sell.

**Rovi** ([ROVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROVI)) cleared an 18.72 buy point in a deep cup in April 2009. Investors who endured a few high-volume pullbacks through or below the 10-week moving average saw the stock almost quadruple by early 2011. But in February that year, Rovi fell below the 10-week line in heavy volume and finished more than 6% below that support level. **1**

Rovi's RS line, meanwhile, began to turn down decisively. **2** Its RS Rating fell below 70 on March 30, 2011. **3** This combination was a clear sell signal.

Those who had gotten out on that date would have still nearly tripled their initial investment. Those who had followed a buy-and-hold strategy would have seen their gains evaporate on July 6 of this year.

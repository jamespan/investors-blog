When Facebook was highlighted in this [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-sector-leaders-review/111615-780971-when-to-sell-stocks.htm) in the Nov. 17 IBD, the daily price action was an example of whipsawing, and sell signals were stacking up like flapjacks during a late-morning Sunday breakfast.


Since that point, however, stock price action in the world's top social network has settled down. The stock is rising comfortably above the 50-day moving average, a sign of strength. And Facebook may be close to completing a new base, which would render a new buy point.


A quick study of the fundamentals helps explain why institutional investor support for **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) appears to continue in strong fashion.


![Sector-Leaders_120815_800](http://ibdcmsprod10/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Sector-Leaders_120815_800.png)Facebook is, by a country mile, the largest company in Sector Leaders on numerous fronts, including market capitalization (\$297 billion), annual revenue (\$15.9 billion in the past four quarters) and share float (2.18 billion; No. 2 in Monday's list is **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) at 114 million). Yet Facebook's growth is nothing short of awesome.


Take the most important yardstick, profits: From 2010 to 2014, Facebook has grown earnings per share from 28 cents to \$1.76. That's a compounded annual increase of 58.3%.


Revenue has bulged from \$1.97 billion to \$12.5 billion over the same time frame, up 535%.


Return on equity has improved, to 18.3% last year from 15.8% in 2012. ROE, a key metric of profitability, in the range of 17% or higher is desirable among [CAN SLIM-quality](http://education.investors.com/) growth companies.


Finally, Wall Street analysts feel bullish about 2016. They see earnings on consensus rising 32% to \$2.86 atop the \$2.16 expected this year. Sales should climb 38% to \$24.03 billion, based on a survey of 48 analysts by Thomson Reuters.


A Nov. 12 [article](http://news.investors.com/technology/111215-780532-facebook-alphabet-positioned-for-advertising-shift.htm) published on Investors.com noted that Facebook is hungry to gain more name-brand advertisers with the posting of 30-second commercials.


The Menlo Park, Calif., firm also has high hopes for generating a fresh revenue stream with its Oculus unit, a specialist in virtual reality technology.

A key tenet of IBD's investing strategy is to focus on leading stocks in leading industry groups.


When stocks move, they tend to move in groups. If a high-quality Internet name reports strong earnings, it tends to lift other Internet stocks. IBD research has shown that close to half of a stock's price movement is directly tied to the performance of its industry group.


Top-rated stocks with solid fundamentals can be found throughout the pages of IBD. It's also not hard to keep tabs on leading industry groups in the market.

IBD's Industry Themes column spotlights strong performing groups in the market with potential for further upside. Each day, IBD market writers scan the database, looking for groups acting well with broad leadership. A group has potential if its leadership is broad. Groups with just one bona fide leader should generally be avoided.


While it's still an overall defensive market, some nondefensive groups are holding their own. In February 2016, IBD's Industry Themes column featured chip stocks. As of Feb. 29's close, all three chip-related groups ranked within the top 25.


Among chip designers, fast-growing Mellanox Technologies recently cleared a base with a 48.24 early buy point. In the chipmaker group, Taiwan Semiconductor has cleared a 23.76 cup-with-handle entry. In the chip-equipment group, KLA-Tencor is approaching a 70.38 buy point from a long cup-with-handle base.

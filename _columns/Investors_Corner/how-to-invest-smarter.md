If you're like most individual investors, you know how to celebrate after cashing in a big gain in a stock. Maybe you take your spouse out to dinner at a previously unaffordable place. Maybe you upgrade your vacation from Paris, Texas, to Paris, France.

But however you celebrate success, do you ever stop to study what you did right?

You might revel at the thought: "Study? Can't I just enjoy the moment? Now you want to tack on more homework?"

Yet identifying the elements that led to your success is essential. Coach Vince Lombardi made the Green Bay Packers' sweep play famous. Every team that faced the Packers knew it was coming but they couldn't consistently stop it.

Lombardi analyzed what made the play work and then drilled the team in repeating those positive details until perfection was a habit.

How do you make perfection a habit in your investing?

Avoiding mistakes alone can't get you there.

Some investors spend a lot of time on the flip side — analyzing errors. That's fine and it should be done. But mistakes can only tell you what not to do. They can't always tell you what to do.

One way to build a better approach to investing is to create a chart scrapbook of your best trades. You particularly want to become aware of elements that show up repeatedly in your different winning stocks.

You might divide your best-stocks scrapbook into three sections: stocks handled well in a strong, smooth market uptrend; stocks handled well in a sideways or choppy market; and stocks handled well in a correction, which could involve short sales.

The sort of things that make you successful will probably differ by the kind of market you are operating in.

The definition of success also may differ. A 15% gain in a choppy market might be a greater accomplishment than a 25% gain in a red-hot market.

Your scrapbook might include these items:

•A chart that shows the buy and sell points.

•A chart of the Nasdaq or S&P 500.

•The small-caps funds vs. large-cap funds charts at the entry and exit of your trade.

•The IBD screen where you found the stock.

•The top-industry-group list at the entry and exit.

•A note on the company's new products or new services.

These things are important because an investment always has a context, and if you don't know the context, you really don't know much of anything.

A proper scrapbook and analysis can tell you what kind of markets you do best in. (It can vary for different people.) The analysis can tell you what kind of sectors often lead to your success. (Some investors do great with retail stocks but can't wrap their brains around tech stocks — or vice versa.) You might consider whether you do better with big caps or small caps.

A warning: Knowing the intricacies of a positive trade isn't at all like the self-help visualization movement that promises success just by imagining the outcome. (There's some social psychology research that suggests that kind of [visualization is counterproductive](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100031X) It hurts motivation.)

Visualize anything you wish, but make sure you do your homework.

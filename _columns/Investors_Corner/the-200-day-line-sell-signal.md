**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

A break of support at a stock's 50-day moving average can be a sell signal. A rupture of support at the 200-day line sends an even stronger message â€” especially if it is the stock's first punch through that line in some time.

These lines are important. They act as reference points for institutional investors. Stocks will rise away from their 50- or 200-day moving averages, then fall back to "test support." Large shareholders use these pullbacks as opportunities to add to positions.

As a result, the stock finds buying support at the line, rebounds and continues its advance. In a healthy uptrend, a leading stock generally pulls back and rebounds from its 50-day line several times between bases. But a base may dip down far enough to test the lower moving average such as the 200-day line, or the 40-week line on a weekly chart.

**Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) sent just such a signal in August 2008. It broke out in late September 2006 over a 33.42 buy point (adjusted for splits) in a 20-week cup-with-handle base. The fertilizer giant ran up 623% in 24 months. Along the way, it stuck close to its 10-week moving average, pulling back regularly to test support.

Potash broke its 10-week line significantly twice, once on a 12% weekly loss in August 2007 **(1)**, then again with a bigger dive in January 2008 **(2)**. In both cases, Potash recovered back above its 10-week line within days. The January dive corrected by 31% from high to low. But the pullback stopped 11% short of the stock's 40-week moving average.

Throughout the two-year run, the stock never touched that line.

That changed in August 2008.

The stock eased gradually from its June high to touch its 40-week line on Aug. 5 **(3)**. Four days later it stabbed through the key support level in strong trade.

Potash clambered back above the line and held support for two more weeks. Then the gig was up.

It cut below the 200-day average in rising trade Sept. 2 and 3. This was a sell signal. The stock only briefly retook support, before posting weekly drops of 16% and 35%. Over the next three months Potash fell 80% from its June 2008 peak.

If you had a big profit cushion, you might have pared your position and waited to see whether the stock was simply basing. But if the stock fails to finish the new base, the run is likely over.

  Acacia, Bats Global Stand Out In Soft IPO Market

The IPO market remains in the doldrums, but it's still an important area to monitor, especially with the major averages back in a confirmed uptrend.


If market health continues to improve, the IPO market could shift out of neutral and into overdrive.


Through mid-May, 22 IPOs raised about \$3.5 billion, down 63% by deal count from the year-ago period, according to Renaissance Capital.


It's no surprise, really. After a horrendous start to the year that saw the Nasdaq plunge nearly 8% in January, the market has recovered some, but uncertainty over the Fed and the health of the economy remains a focal point.


Yet some compelling names deserve attention, such as recent new breakout stock **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)), **Bats Global Markets** ([BATS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BATS)) and **AveXis** ([AVXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVXS)), just to name a few. There's a track of record of growth for Acacia and Bats, but biotech AveXis isn't profitable yet and won't be for a while.


IBD has long stressed the importance of "new" in the stock market. New highs, new products and services, and new economic and industry conditions should always be a focal point for growth investors on the prowl for the next big stock market winner.


But IPOs must be looked at differently than a typical growth stock. Due to a short trading history, some breakouts can occur from short bases. An IPO base can be as short as two weeks. In 2004, Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) cleared a three-week base just after its IPO and never looked back.


Other IPOs might have lukewarm ratings due to a limited track record of earnings. As a general rule of thumb, look for higher-priced IPOs, not those priced in the single digits. Look for a large price increase on the day it goes public. A highly-regarded underwriter also helps. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are regarded as top-tier underwriters with a long-term track record of successful IPOs.


An IPO might not measure up when it comes to all seven [CAN SLIM traits](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749), but if the earnings and sales growth is there and the chart is sound, that's usually good enough.

In the Stock Lists tab at the top of the home page, click on [IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) for a list of top-rated new issues. In the IBD Weekly weekend edition, check the top of the New America page (today on A6) to see what's being talked about in the AfterMarket graphic. In the latest week, **U.S. Foods** ([USFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USFD)) was featured. It went public Thursday at 23, near the high end of a proposed range of 21-24. It closed at 24.91 on its first day of trading.


The accompanying table highlights some recent IPOs with positive traits. Acacia has been a standout performer since its May 13 debut. It's a provider of high-speed optical-networking products that could potentially be an industry disrupter. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) has more than tripled from its IPO price of 42 because it emerged as a disrupter in the security software space. It made an outstanding breakout past a 72.60 buy point in August 2014. Shortly before the breakout, it was added to [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) and went on to rally 176% to a peak of 200.55.


Exchange operator Bats Global also has potential. It's trading comfortably above its offering price as it tries to clear an IPO base with a 27.60 entry.

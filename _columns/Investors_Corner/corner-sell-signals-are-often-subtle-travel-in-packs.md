In 2007, **Research In Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)), the maker of BlackBerry smart phones, flashed a flurry of sell signals as it neared its top in November of that year.


The stock's initial breakout came in mid-September 2006. It cleared a second-stage base in May the next year.


In July 2007, it settled into what looked like a potential base **1**. The stock stumbled below its 50-day moving average, but heavy volume kicked in to support and lift it back above the line. That was a good sign.


It was the second successful pullback to the 10-week moving average since Research In Motion broke out in May.


A key cause for caution: A 3-for-1 stock split occurred just as the stock was climbing to new highs after finding support at the 10-week line **2**. Major stock splits often occur at or near the tops of winning runs.


Research In Motion advanced for six of the next seven weeks as the stock started to look like it was overextending itself **3**. A gap-up on Oct. 5 appeared to be an exhaustion gap, given that it occurred after RIM's long advance.


Research In Motion formed a three-weeks-tight pattern that began on Oct. 5, 2007 **4**. It broke above the buy point on Oct. 23 in huge volume. It tried to advance, but slipped a fraction the following day in heavy trade. This marked a stalling action **5**.


You want to sell into strength, but you hate to leave potential winnings on the table.


But given the buildup of sell signals over the prior two months, shareholders should have been on high alert.


Shares drifted to new highs in light volume: another unhealthy straw placed on the camel's back.


Research In Motion collapsed in heavy volume on Nov. 8 **6** — the largest point loss since the stock's advance from May 2007. Thus, it was another sell signal.


This marked the end of the visit — time to pack your bags and go.


Shares fell in heavy volume for three days, through their 10-week line of support. They never recovered above the closing level of the Nov. 8 session.

In his classic "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William J. O'Neil writes that as much as "37% of a stock's price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group the stock is in."


IBD's Your Weekly Review, a unique screen of highly rated stocks published each Friday, is built with the fruits of that research in mind.


Your Weekly Review lists up to 120 minicharts of stocks, and all of those stocks are graded in descending order by the relative strength of the industry group to which they belong.


Thus, studying Your Weekly Review (starting on page A5 of Friday's print edition) enables any serious investor to isolate quickly those stocks that appear in the very top performing groups, out of the total 197 such groups that IBD identifies and ranks based on six-month price action every trading day. Use the accompanying column written by IBD's market writers and editors as a map to navigate through the list and find promising candidates to buy in a healthy [market uptrend](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735746&sourceid=735749).


No matter how weak or strong a stock’s industry group fares, the screen includes only stocks having EPS and Relative Strength ratings of at least 85 out of a possible 99. That's why the screen is sometimes referred to as the 85-85 Index.


In a roaring bull market, you will see 120 stocks appearing week after week in Your Weekly Review, with perhaps dozens more waiting in the wings that didn't qualify only because of space limitations. Alternatively in a bear market, the list will shrink considerably.


In fact, to determine the overall health of the market, make a habit of counting how many stocks appear in Your Weekly Review. During rough markets, you might notice a sharp drop in little time. For instance, in the Dec. 4, 2015, edition, the section contained four full pages' worth of minicharts and 177 stocks in the tables. By the end of January this year, the list shriveled to 56 names. Since then, the list has recovered mildly.


To make the screen, all stocks must sell for at least \$10 a share, trade within 15% of their 52-week highs, and show a minimum average volume of 10,000 shares a day. Investors should be wary of such thin traders. Focus on more liquid stocks with an average daily volume of about half a million. As an adjunct to the charts, the table in Your Weekly Review features the name of one A-rated mutual fund with a large position in these stocks. This supplies evidence of the I in IBD’s [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) investment acronym, which stands for institutional sponsorship.


Your Weekly Review's accompanying table gives readers a sense of the market's defensive mood. **Performance Food Group** ([PFGC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFGC)), **Hormel Foods** ([HRL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRL)) and **Chesapeake Utilities** ([CPK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPK)) are the third highest-ranked in the Feb. 19 edition of Your Weekly Review. In other words, the market is prizing businesses in food distribution, pork supply and natural gas utility above more high-growth sectors.


Dividend-rich real estate investment trusts such as **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)), **Agree Realty** ([ADC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADC)) and **Kimco Realty** ([KIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KIM)), all of which sport a Composite Rating of 98 or 99.

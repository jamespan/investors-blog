If you're brand new to stock investing, sometimes you might wonder, in private or aloud: "As for research, where should I start?"


It's not an easy question. After all, there's the market itself, which is essentially an ocean of stocks. Plus, all of those 8,000-plus stocks get diced and sliced into 197 separate industry groups in IBD. (See the entire list of industries in Monday's "Making Money" section.)


As you do more research and make a few trades, you eventually come to realize that mastering multiple fields is vital to making money in stocks. Those fields include the market trend; economic trends; psychological trends; your own self-psychology; portfolio management; and summoning the self-discipline to follow sound rules, both in buying and selling.


Here's another field to master: how to get a strong feel for corporate earnings trends.


Serious financial publications focus on earnings. Why?


More than any other single factor, earnings -- or profits after taxes -- drive investor decisions in equity markets across the world. In IBD's [CAN SLIM investment approach](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749), both the "C" and "A" in the acronym point to a company's earnings results. When a company's earnings per share thrive, its stock also thrives. When earnings dive, or there is a perception on Wall Street that they will fall, so does the stock.


How can you use IBD's features and Investors.com to be in the know about earnings? Take these three tips.


**1)** Read the corporate stories on pages A1 and A2 in the newspaper or on the home page of Investors.com. The majority of corporations follow the typical calendar year ending in December in reporting financial results. So, expect a wave of earnings stories two to fours weeks after March 31 (the end of the first quarter), June 30 (end of Q2), Sept. 30 (Q3) and Dec. 31 (Q4).


Let's take a peek at IBD's Jan. 22 edition. On Page A1, reporter James DeTar noted that railroad giants **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)), **Canadian Pacific Railway** ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)) and **CSX** ([CSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSX)) reported "downbeat quarter earnings" and that analysts say "the rail sector is clearly in recession."


How to interpret the news? First, railroad stocks have likely sold off due to profit disappointments. Secondly, these stocks may provide a valuable future opportunity in the stock market when their earnings turn higher.


On the same Page A1, fellow reporter Gillian Rich covered the airlines, also in the transportation sector. While railroads have suffered from the plunge in crude oil prices and withering demand for shipping "black gold," airlines have gotten a mighty EPS boost thanks to lower fuel costs. Rich's article notes that, despite the cut in fuel costs, airlines in January "were able to raise fares by \$3 for a one-way domestic ticket."


**2)** Check out the Company Earnings Reports tables, featured practically each day in the paper. The list bulges during the meat of earnings season. To save time in your research, note the boldfaced figures of those companies where EPS grew at least 25% on a year-over-year basis. If a company also shows an EPS Rating of 85 or higher, and it exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimate, the entire line of data for that company is boldfaced.


In the Jan. 22 IBD, telecom giant **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) (scoring a 92 EPS Rating and beating Wall Street views by 1%), **Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) (98 EPS, 4.3% beat) and thinly traded **Insteel Industries** ([IIIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IIIN)) (98 EPS, 3% beat) all got the boldface treatment.


**3)** Concentrate on the content regarding earnings and earnings estimates for IBD's stories in The New America and Internet & Technology sections, as well as the various minicharts found in market features such as the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/top10/default.aspx), Big Cap 20, [IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and The Income Investor.

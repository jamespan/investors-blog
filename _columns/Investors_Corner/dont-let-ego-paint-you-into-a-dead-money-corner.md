_12th In A Series_

The need to be right can paint investors into a corner.

When that happens, you can pretend you're a long-term investor who intended all along to sit on the floor and wait for the paint to dry. But saving face wastes time and money.

How we get ourselves in such messes is a question for philosophers and psychiatrists to answer.

Smart investors should not be much interested in why bad things happen. Human nature is human nature, and none of us is perfect. The better question to focus on is this: What steps can you take to avoid those messes?

The messes can include ignoring the 7%-8% sell rule because you're convinced you're right about the stock; buying a stock with faulty fundamentals because your gut feeling tells you it will be a big winner; and averaging down because the market is "mispricing the stock."

Now, we could say, "Don't do that!" But you knew the rules and didn't follow them, didn't you? What's needed are steps that make bad judgment less likely to happen.

Here are three preventive steps to consider:

• **Construct a fence of silence around your trades**. Our ego often needs a big mouth and an audience if it is to grow strong enough to distort our reactions.

If you talk to others about what you are buying or have bought, then you will be tempted to defend the stock should it start to go wrong. It's much easier to unwind a mistake if you haven't publicly attached your ego to the decision. Silence is the fence that makes it hard for your ego to grow.

• **Trim your sources.** Catholic nuns used to tell children to avoid "bad companions." Bad companions can draw you into mischief you wouldn't ordinarily consider.

If you read too many financial pundits and watch too many stock guessers on TV, you're opening the door to some bad companions. Many will self-confidently tell you what's going to happen next. But no one knows the future.

Most of your time should be focused on the price and volume action of the market itself. That's your best guide.

• **Use automatic stops to eliminate excuses for not selling a loser.** It's all too easy for the 7%-8% sell rule to become a good intention that you never act on.

So, attach stops when you buy a stock. This way you won't be tempted to slide into a bad situation in stages. "Yes, it's down 8%, but I think it will turn around before it gets to 10%... Oh, it's down 10%, but it won't hurt to give it just a little more room. .. It's down 15% but isn't this like being early on the next climb up the right side of a new base?"

You can paint pretty lies until you get to "Oh, no, it's down 35%! I can't sell now, it's way too late!"

At that point, you've painted yourself into a buy-and-hold corner.

The growth investor who buys growth stocks and then lets his mistakes change the strategy is combining the worst of both worlds. Growth stocks, especially the leaders, are known for correcting more than the market.

The true buy-and-hold investor chooses steadier stocks. The investor who chooses fast growers must find ways to reduce the influence of ego and cut losses quickly.

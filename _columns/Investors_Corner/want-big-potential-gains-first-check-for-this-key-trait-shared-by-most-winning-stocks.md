Now that earnings season is upon us again, what better time to take a refresher course on the importance of a solid earnings track record?

Buying stocks during this time can be especially tricky, since an upside or downside surprise in a company's earnings report can send its stock sharply higher or lower. So too can a notable acceleration or slowdown in growth vs. the same year-ago period.Â It's no coincidence that two of the letters in the [CAN SLIM investing system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) represent earnings: C for current earnings, and A for annual earnings.

There are many other fundamental and technical criteria to consider before buying any stock, but the year-over-year percentage gain in earnings per share _is still the most important factor_ to potential success in investing, on both a quarterly and annual basis.

"A standout stock needs both a sound growth record in recent years and a strong current earnings record in the last several quarters," IBD founder and Chairman Bill O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "It's the powerful combination of these two critical factors, rather than one or the other, that creates a super stock, or at least one that has a higher chance for true success."

That's where the [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) comes into play. IBD's proprietary metric studies the two most recent quarters of earnings growth and the three-year growth rate. The result is compared with all other stocks and assigned a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) rating. A 99 EPS Rating means the company outperformed 99% of all others.

Take **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), for example. The Illinois-based beauty store operator owns a streak of quarterly double-digit earnings gains spanning more than four years. Growth has held at 22% or better the past 11 quarters, with analysts expecting a 24% increase in both the current and next quarter.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IC_ulta_042417-1024x550.png)Now let's take a look at its annual profits. Ulta's three-year earnings growth rate is 27%. Consensus estimates call for a 24% gain for the January-ending fiscal year and 21% in fiscal 2019.

The beauty chain's annual EPS has risen 20% or more each year for the past eight years. It has a 98 EPS Rating.

The stock's overall performance has been stellar too. It's hit some bumps along the way, but has ramped up more than 67 times from its March 2009 low.

When Ulta broke out of a cup pattern at 188.58 with a 17% gap up in quadruple-normal volume on March 11, 2016, earnings per share jumped 22%, 22% and 27% in the prior three quarters. The breakout, in fact, came the day after Ulta reported that 27% EPS gain.

Ulta remains in buy range from a recent 274.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/). It's up 133% from an October 2014 breakout from a cup with handle. That includes a 38% advance last year vs. a 7.5% gain for the Nasdaq composite.

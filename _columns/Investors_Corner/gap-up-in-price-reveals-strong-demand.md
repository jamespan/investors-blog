Some things just don't feel right in the stock market. It's not easy cutting a loss when a trade doesn't go right, taking profits when a gain reaches 20% or averaging up in price with a top performer in your portfolio.

You know what else doesn't feel right? Buying a stock when it gaps up in price.

Few have the courage to do it, but market precedents show that it can be a profitable endeavor.

When a high-quality stock gaps up more than 5% past a buy point, it's easy to say that it's extended in price and too late to buy. But if the stock has the look of an emerging leader, with outstanding fundamentals and a bullish chart, it's OK to buy. Just try to buy as close to the opening price as possible.

The forces of supply and demand govern a stock's price movement every day. Buyers and sellers are always matched, but when a stock gaps up in price, buyers overwhelm sellers. Buying on a gap-up might seem counterintuitive, but all you're doing is swimming with the market's current, riding the coattails of institutional investors and others.

**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) gapped up powerfully on Aug. 4, 2010, just a few weeks ahead of a follow-through day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 that marked the start of a market uptrend. Strong earnings and a raised outlook were the catalyst. The online travel firm opened at 281.30, well above a cup-with-handle buy point of 234.55. Volume was at 6.8 million shares, well above an average daily volume of 1.5 million. Clearly, big investors were buying.

The monster gain triggered IBD's eight-week-hold rule for handling fast movers because it rallied 20% within three weeks after the breakout.

Plenty of other stocks show how a gap-up in price can be a good time to buy. **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) did it on July 22, 2009, also on strong earnings. **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) did it on July 25, 2013, and **J2 Global** ([JCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JCOM)) did it on Feb. 14, 2013. The moves marked the start of lengthy uptrends for all.

A common myth on Wall Street is "all gaps must be filled." When a stock gaps up powerfully in price, the thinking is that the stock must trade down to the pre-gap level before resuming its advance. The above three examples show that this is not always the case. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.

Investors shouldn't buy gap-ups when a stock has already made a major run and is well extended in price. Such price action can often flag a stock's top.

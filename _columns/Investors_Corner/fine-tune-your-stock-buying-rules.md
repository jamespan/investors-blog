Lots of things that are tempting aren't good for you.

  

One of those is the temptation to buy a stock on a late pullback, even if it has consistently rebounded after prior retreats.

  

There are lots of logical reasons investors would want to make such a move.

  

If the stock makes a sound advance following a proper breakout, a first or second pullback to a key support level is a valid entry point. Get in early in the run-up, the thinking goes, to capitalize on the big rally.

  

But winning stocks eventually will peak when institutional investors are on the way out. Sometimes other fund managers step in at key levels to take advantage of the pullback. Sometimes not.

  

When they do with real force, this is what traders call support. Stocks often find positive support at their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, as well as at other key price levels.

  

But a falling stock gives no assurances. If you hold and buy only when a stock is rising from support or through a buy point in strong volume, you are buying at the most advantageous point â€” just as institutional investors are piling into it. That positive momentum leaves you with a cushion. That cushion keeps you from being shaken out if the stock makes a normal pullback.

  

When you buy a leading stock rising through a buy point or rebounding from support, you are reducing your risk by taking advantage of research showing these are opportune places at which to buy.

  

Consider **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) in June 2012. The fast-growing energy drink maker had run up 280% following an August 2010 breakout. The stock had found support right at its 10-week moving average, with a few brief exceptions, across the entire length of that run.

  

That may have made it a tempting buy to many investors as the stock retreated toward its 10-week line in June. Shares had already staged numerous pullbacks since clearing another base the prior August. That meant a new base was overdue, another reason to hold off on a decision to buy.

  

The stock stabbed below its 10-week line in massive trade June 28 **(1)**, then recovered. When it dropped through the line again, this time in light trade, in mid-July, it was on its way to a 45% decline over the next four months. Those who bought near 72 were forced to cut losses at 7% to 8%.

  

Even talented investors can still get hurt if they break the rules and buy on the way down. These are generally investors who have put their time in learning the ropes, and who fit T.S. Eliot's old line about tampering with the rules of poetry and grammar, "It's not wise to violate the rules until you know how to observe them."

  

Investors who buy on the pullback also tend already to have a big cushion in the stock, and they are well versed in how to shave their holdings quickly if no support arrives.

  

Another temptation is to buy a deeply eroded stock speculating that, at some point, it will recover to its former highs. This is the realm of the deep value investor, and it requires significant research and expertise to determine whether a battered stock really has intrinsic value and what kind of stock price that value may or may not make it worth.

  

It doesn't pay to mix investing strategies.

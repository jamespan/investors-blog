The stock market is now back in a confirmed uptrend, and you know exactly what to do as an investor.

  

You have mastered how to quickly build a stock watch list. You recognize bullish chart patterns with ease. You know how to spot telltale signs that institutional investors are accumulating a stock. And you know when is the right time to buy a leading stock.

  

But what if the market spins its wheels again like it did in January 2015?

  

The Nasdaq composite finished last year at 4736. After a set of rapid sell-offs and rebounds, the index ended Feb. 6 at 4744, up slightly. Meanwhile, the Jan. 8 follow-through certainly has not yet revealed the same sort of strength that was seen in follow-through rallies in March 2009, September 2010 or late November 2012.

  

Last week's price gains were a welcome change for the bulls. But over the past year, stocks have shown their vulnerability to numerous corrections of 5% to 10%. A decline of that magnitude quickly erases solid gains even in the top dogs in your investment portfolio.

  

Do you have a game plan when the next rocky phase arrives?

  

The daily [Investor's Corner column](http://education.investors.com/), in Wednesday's newspaper on B10, is the final part of a seven-story series to help you adjust your trading rules so that you avoid getting whipsawed.

  

The first story in this series, which ran in the Feb. 6 newspaper, [defines a choppy stock market](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/738333-how-to-play-choppy-market.htm). All the stories note special rules and techniques to help you reduce your losses and nail down decent gains.

  

The stories give historical examples of how one could have bought and sold a leading stock effectively during a tough market. They include the case studies of **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) in 2014 and **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)). The [Under Armour stock analysis](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/738531-it-pays-to-tighten-sell-rules-in-choppy-markets.htm) was printed in the Feb. 10 newspaper and the [Foot Locker stock performance review](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/738736-when-to-sell-stocks.htm).

  

It never hurts to re-read a story that beefs up your stock trading skill and expands your knowledge of IBD buy and sell rules. You can always revisit them in the [Investor's Corner archives](http://education.investors.com/). Go there by clicking on the IBD University tab on the home page of Investors.com.

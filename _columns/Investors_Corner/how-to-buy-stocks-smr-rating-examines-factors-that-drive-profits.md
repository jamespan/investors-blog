IBD's SMR Rating is a set of three financial gauges that help investors understand a company's future performance based on past metrics, namely the ones that influence profitability.


Earnings are a powerful indicator, but what drives earnings growth? The answer does not lie in profits or sales alone but rather in a combination of several indicators. The SMR Rating tries to look at what the company has done, is doing, and will probably continue to do.




IBD's SMR Rating is a combination of three gauges: sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity (ROE). The rating goes from A to E, with A being the best and E the lowest.


Three Key Indicators Of Profit Quality
--------------------------------------


The S stands for sales growth. Sales increases of at least 25% in the most recent quarters and for the current year set apart leading stocks, based on studies of market winners.


The M stands for profit margins. Investors should look at both pretax annual margins and after-tax quarterly margins when assessing a company's profitability. Ideally, both should be near the top of the recent quarters and for their industry.

Return on equity is a simple division of net income by shareholders' equity. ROE of 17% or higher is a good indication of a company's ability to profitably use shareholders' money.


The SMR Rating has helped identify many winning stocks.Â  Take [IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full) stock **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)).


The renewable energy company's sales grew 46% to 97% in the four quarters ending in Q2 of 2022, according to [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge). Enphase's return on equity had been higher than other stocks in the renewable energy sector, an outstanding 74% in the 2021 fiscal year.


Pretax profit margin was 25.1% in the 2021 fiscal year, a figure that can be found in the [stock quote for Enphase](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-enphase-energy-inc-enph.htm).


Enphase broke out of a double-bottom base June 2, 2022. At the time, its SMR Rating was an A. After its [earnings report on July 26](https://www.investors.com/news/enphase-energy-stock-a-solar-company-poised-for-an-earnings-breakout/), the stock rose nearly 40% to new highs. This month, the SMR Rating is a still-proper B.


You can find the SMR Rating on [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-enphase-energy-inc-enph.aspx) and on the proprietary chart analysis tool [IBD MarketSurge.](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge)


Exceptions, Other Factors To Consider
-------------------------------------


The SMR Rating should be used in tandem with other factors such as the sector outlook, macroeconomic outlook and other factors that may affect corporate profits during a quarter or a year.


Exceptions to the rule should also be kept in mind. There is not enough data to judge a company that has just gone public. So a company with a poor SMR Rating may turn around and become very successful, and vice versa.

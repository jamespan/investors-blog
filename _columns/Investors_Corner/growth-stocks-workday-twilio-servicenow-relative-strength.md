  Growth Stocks Workday, Twilio, ServiceNow Share This In Common: Relative Strength

Top growth stocks often share similar traits. Top software developers **Workday** ([WDAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WDAY)), **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) and **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) share one very specific trait important to [CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).




One thing you'll run across when using IBD and Investors.com is the [Industry Group Rankings](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/stock-market-tech-stocks/). IBD divides all the stocks in its database among 197 industry groups. It tracks the performance of these groups through a number of key metrics. Most important among those is the group-based Relative Strength Ranking of all the stocks in a particularly group vs. the S&P 500 over the prior six months.


This tends to weed out incidental accelerations or declines that occur over shorter six- or eight-week periods. The [industry with the best performance ranks No. 1](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-29-2019/). The weakest industry ranks No. 197.


Top Growth Stocks Come From Top Industries
------------------------------------------


Why bother?


[IBD founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) noticed in his early trading days that capital tended to move into particularly robust industry groups at particular times. In addition, leading stocks often emerged from these groups – rising to [form bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) and [break out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) as money flowed in.



Subsequent research from IBD bore out O'Neil's observations, showing that almost 50% of a leading stock's strength following a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) can be tied to the strength of its industry group and sector (a larger designation, made up of multiple industry groups) at the time of its breakout.


Time and again this approach has provided investors who follow the [CAN SLIM strategy](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) a leg up in pinpointing leading growth stocks ahead of breakouts.


In an established uptrend, or following a brief market consolidation, investors would normally want to focus on groups ranked in the top 20. These are detailed in the B section of IBD Weekly. All of the groups are tracked on Investors.com's [Industry Group Rankings page](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-31-2019/).


The current market is more upended than is typical. Many stocks have sought more serious price drops to consolidate gains following a multiyear bull market advance. That helped drive both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell briefly into [bear market status](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/could-you-have-spotted-the-1987-stock-market-top-yes-heres-how/) at the end of December.


A Top 10 Industry Group: Workday, ServiceNow, Twilio
----------------------------------------------------



As is normal during such a correction, [leadership began to shift among stocks and industry groups](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/current-stock-market-continues-rotation-ibd-lists/). This occurs as institutional investors reposition capital, adapting to changing outlooks for the period ahead. As they sell out of certain industries and market sectors and into others, those shifts reflect in IBD's industry rankings. They also reflect in [changes in leadership among ETFs](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/best-etfs-new-leaders-small-cap-oil/).


Currently, smart-money investors are poised for a broad range of possibilities. U.S. tariffs on China could increase March 2, or some sort of agreement could be reached between the two countries. Another federal government shutdown could be on the way. The U.K.'s Brexit from the European Union is currently set for March 29, and no trade agreement has yet been achieved.


The impact of sanctions on Venezuela, the slowing of China's economy over and above the impact of U.S. sanctions, and the possible impact from Federal Reserve policy moves are among the many other factors smart-money investors are taking into account.


This broader-than-usual palette of concerns, combined with a correction that is digesting years of market gains, means leading growth stocks are spread across a wider array of industry than might otherwise be typical.


This is one reason why as of Feb. 1  the average industry group ranking among [IBD's current Leaderboard lineup](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) of elite stocks is 34. All of the stocks come from groups ranked in the top 50 among IBD's 197 groups.



But still, the strongest redoubt within the Leaderboard lineup comes from one industry group: Computer Software – Enterprise. The group is the source of four leaders in the current Leaderboard list: Workday, ServiceNow, Twilio and **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)).


The group ranked No. 5 in IBD's Industry Group Rankings as of Friday's market close, up from No. 73 in early February.


Finding Industry Rankings
-------------------------


In IBD Weekly, Industry Group Rankings appear on stock mini-charts, as well as in the [IBD Smart NYSE & Nasdaq Tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-jan-29-2019/) and other stock lists. At Investors.com, the basic Stock Quote provides a stock's industry group, as well as an A-through-D letter grade for a stock's industry group relative strength. [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) gives the specific industry group ranking, as well as an RS grade and the top-ranked stocks within the group.


Another option is to go to the [Stock Lists pulldown menu](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), then click on [Industry Group Rankings](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-29-2019/). This gives a control-panel view of all of the 197 Industry Group Rankings. It also provides changes in those rankings over the prior eight weeks, as well as the year-to-date change and the group Composite Rating.

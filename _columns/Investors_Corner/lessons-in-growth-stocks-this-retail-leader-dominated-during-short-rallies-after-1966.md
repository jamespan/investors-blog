Levitz specialized as the early pioneer in the warehouse furniture discount sales business.

It was incorporated in 1965 and had its IPO in late 1968, the beginning of a bear market that dropped 36% over 18 months. It was a trying period for the country and the market.

From 1966 to 1982 the Dow Jones industrials made it to the 1,000 area five times and rapidly fell into new bear markets, down between 25% and 45% over 18 months or so.

## Growth Stocks And Market Turbulence In The 1960s

It was the Vietnam era that began when President Kennedy sent military advisers to Vietnam in the early 1960s and continued under Presidents Johnson and Nixon until the Vietnam 1973 peace accords.

But then came Nixon's Watergate, resignation and the Ford and Carter years.

Under Carter, the prime interest rate set a record high of 21% and inflation was 12%.

We lost numerous countries to Soviet Union expansionism and Iran to the Ayatollah Khomeini, whose radicals seized our U.S. Embassy, taking hostages in 1979. Finally this prolonged back and forth period ended in 1982 with Reagan's largest tax cuts in U.S. history — 25% over three years — to set off a 17-year advance from 1,000 in the Dow to 11,750 in 2000. Inflation dropped to 1% from 12%.

## Before The Levitz Stock Breakout, This Occurred

While the Dow seemed to have its limits, the many two-year rallies that happened after 1966 found stocks just like Levitz that had huge increases that all started with a [market follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) ending the market decline.

Digital Equipment, **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)), Sea Containers, Flight Safety, Pic 'N' Save (now **Big Lots** ([BIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIG))), Humana, **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) were examples that ultimately advanced 5, 10, or 50 times or more.

Every cycle was led by America's innovators. So get prepared for the future leaders.

## The Breakout And The Big Run

Levitz built a classic [40-week cup-with-handle weekly chart base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and gave you many points to add to your position on the way up when the stock bounced off its 10-week moving average line — all the way up until the upside channel line told you it was time to sell.

You must learn all the individual stock buy and sell rules in order to capture the best growth stocks. Also, pay attention to the general market buy and sell rules, not personal opinions.

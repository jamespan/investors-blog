A stock's chart tells a story that investors shouldn't ignore, especially when it comes to deciding whether to buy, sell or avoid a stock.

  

One danger sign that investors should heed is wide-and-loose price action, or swings of 10% to 15% or even more from peak to trough during a given week.

  

Healthy stocks typically form smooth, rounded bases. They feature tight weekly closes, often in quiet volume. This means mutual funds and other deep-pocketed institutional investors are supporting the stock by buying shares when other investors sell.

  

These funds typically build positions over time to minimize risk and prevent the wild swings that would occur if they started buying or selling large blocks of shares at one time.

  

By contrast, stocks whose weekly swings are wild and frequent are flashing warning signals. Such volatile action suggests that some big investors have lost conviction and have started to sell.

  

A few weeks of wide swings aren't necessarily bad, especially if they occur as the stock corrects to form a new base. In this case, look to see if the stock has closed in the upper half of its weekly trading range, as big funds have likely stepped in to support the stock. This is also true of stocks that get support at their 50-day and 10-week moving averages.

  

High volatility throughout the pattern signals trouble, especially in bases that form after a stock has already enjoyed a strong run-up. Let's look at **Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)). The developer of touchpad and touchscreen interfaces for computers and mobile devices began shaping a fourth-stage cup-without-handle base in the week ended Dec. 3, 2004.

  

Late-stage bases are risky, and Synaptics had already quadrupled after breaking out of a first-stage base in May 2003. Furthermore, Synaptics' price swings ranged from 10% to 32% in seven of the base's nine weeks â€” a clear warning sign.

  

To calculate the percentage swing, subtract the weekly low from the weekly high. Then divide the difference by the weekly low and multiply by 100.

  

Another red flag was that the stock closed in the lower 40% of its price range in two of the three weeks that it climbed the right side of the base. You'd prefer to see trading tighten up as the stock nears its buy point.

  

Even the week in which the stock spiked 28% in heavy volume could be viewed with suspicion. That's because it gave the base a V-shaped look, another typical flaw in a late-stage base.

  

Synaptics broke out above the 39.27 buy point in strong volume during the week ended Feb. 4, 2005 as the market rallied.

  

But in the very next week, the stock crashed 43% in massive volume **(1)**, slicing through its 10-week and 40-week moving averages, setting off sell signals along the way. It took 2-1/2 years for Synaptics to retake its February 2005 high of 41.19.

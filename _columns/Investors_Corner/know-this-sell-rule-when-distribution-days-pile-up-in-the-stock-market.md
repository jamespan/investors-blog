The adage of "everything in moderation" has merit. This especially applies to deciding when to take profits in your stocks.


Over the past few weeks, IBD's [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/) has armed readers with more than a dozen of the most important sell rules to help you lock in gains when a stock is showing topping signs. These sell rules are not the product of one person's opinion. IBD developed these sell rules through an exhaustive study of the best stock market winners over the past 50 years and how each of these winners behaved when they peaked in price.


The point is not to be perfect in one's sells, but to take solid gains and not let them fritter away.


Certainly, too much of anything can have undesired consequences. In investing, a few distribution days here and there in the stock market isn't a cause for concern.


But watch out when they pile up in a short time frame.


Today's column focuses on one of the most important sell signals an investor can learn, which is when to spot a major top in the market itself. This is the principle of M, or "Market," in IBD's [CAN SLIM seven-point investment system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


A distribution day occurs when one of the major stock indexes, namely the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500, falls at least 0.2% or more in higher volume than the prior day. For the S&P 500, IBD uses total turnover on the New York Stock Exchange.


As IBD Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How To Make Money In Stocks," "After four or five days of definite distribution over any span of four or five weeks, the general market will almost always turn down." When this happens, carefully assess each stock in your portfolio and reduce your exposure accordingly. And in some cases, it's wise to get out completely.


Market rallies do not go on forever. At some point, they will end. This usually happens when the market gets smacked with a heavy load of distribution days.


The buildup of distribution days is a sign that professionals are taking a lot of money off the table. Only institutions have the power to run stocks significantly higher or lower. So a large amount of distribution can shift the market into correction mode.


When this happens, the news headlines and investor optimism may still be bright and sunny. Don't sit idle and watch your hard-earned gains disappear when a steep sell-off starts.


![ic_dist_110816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IC_dist_110816.jpg)To track the distribution count and the market trend, use The Big Picture column and the accompanying Market Pulse table every day.


In IBD Weekly, the story runs in the second section of the paper; to read the story online, go to "Market Trend" in the main navigation bar at Investors.com and click on "[The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/)."


No system will get you out of the market right at the very top. But using IBD's distribution-day model will help get you out before the big wave of selling hits.


In September 2012, the S&P 500 reached its best levels in nearly five years, but distribution days began to bunch up. By Oct. 9, the index had six distribution days.


The S&P 500 added a seventh distribution day Oct. 10, shifting the market outlook to correction. The 500 weakened the next couple of days, before bouncing off its 50-day line.


Over the next few weeks, the S&P 500 fell 6%. Ex-leaders were hard-hit. Apple extended its slide. **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) and Tibco Software have sunk 62% and 48%, respectively.


The IBD Big Picture has in the past also studied distribution-day trends in other popular indexes, including the Dow Jones industrial average, the NYSE composite and the Russell 2000. However, studies have shown that in some cases these indexes can show a rush of distribution, but the overall market trend remains up. So for now focus your attention on what the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are doing each day.


Readers of The Big Picture will benefit by viewing the "General Market Indicators" page, which is attached as a link at the bottom of the column, and analyzing the price-and-volume interaction on large daily charts of the Nasdaq and the 500. The page also highlights the breadth of the market in terms of rising stocks vs. falling ones. The put-call volume ratio gives readers a sense of the current psychology of market players.

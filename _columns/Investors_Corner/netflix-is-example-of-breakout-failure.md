Even the greatest market leaders succumb to the laws of gravity.


For the advanced IBD reader who has a daredevil streak, this fact can create profit opportunities on the short-selling side.


Thursday's column highlighted the head-and-shoulders pattern that many former winners build before falling flat on their faces.


You might also want to keep an eye out for the late-stage base breakout that flops fast.


A late-stage base is fraught with risk. The stock has already made tons of profits for early shareholders. Intense media attention has made the stock too obvious as a "proven" winner.


When such a stock finishes that third, fourth or even fifth base, it may stretch to new highs. Volume may be energetic. But soon after the breakout, a tired stock will stall, reverse in price and drop quickly. It could happen the week after the breakout, or even during the breakout week itself.


Often, the market may also be rolling over after a big move up.


When is the right time to sell shares short?


Monitor a weekly chart closely. When the stock is looking to close in price below the 10-week moving average and volume is accelerating, it's time. If the stock has already fallen below the late-stage base's low, it may be too late to short.


Don't be surprised if a stock's fundamentals are superstrong. Maybe the company's growth has peaked, and a slowdown is just around the corner.


If the market is amassing distribution days and the market is correcting, the chances of making money on the short side rise. But always cut losses on the short position at 8% if it doesn't pan out.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) made a phenomenal run from its October 2009 breakout at 48.30 to as high as 304.79 in July 2011. During that rise, the innovative video rental firm built no fewer than four distinct bases.


In early July 2011, Netflix notched new highs, but its base was a faulty cup that was just four weeks long. **1**Â  In the week ended July 29, it split the 10-week line in heavy trade. **2** This was the time to short.


At the start of the week, Netflix had a 99 Composite Rating, a 99 EPS and a 96 RS. But that same week, the market slumped into a correction.

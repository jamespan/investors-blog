The double-bottom base, a key chart pattern for growth investors, has a cousin that features a lower buy point than its better-known relative.

This variation of the double-bottom is known as the shakeout + 3. The pattern's name may sound weird, but once you understand how it works, the name makes all the sense in the world.

In a standard double-bottom, the correct entry is found by locating the middle peak on the "W" formation and adding 10 cents to its price level.

The shakeout + 3 is also used for W-shaped patterns. The key difference is where the proper buy point goes. Once you've identified a consolidation with two distinct lows, locate the low of the first bottom. Whatever price that is, add three dollars to it. That's your buy point. For example, if the first low is at 32.50, think of buying shares at 35.50.

Usually, the entry is at least several points below the middle peak in the pattern. In other words, this pattern gives you an earlier entry point.

By now, "shakeout + 3" is starting to make some sense. But you're probably wondering, "Hey, couldn't I just use this method for every double-bottom?" Not necessarily.

When the stock rises above the buy point, it should act like a breakout: The share price and volume should rise decisively. If you see modest action at the crucial point, it's probably best to wait for the traditional double-bottom buy point.

The three points that you add work best on stocks priced around 15 to 35 a share. On higher-priced stocks, you should proportionally increase the points that you add from the first bottom. For example, if the low of the first bottom is, say, 60, add six points rather than three.

In 2005, **Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) consolidated for 10 weeks, making two significant dips. The first low touched down at 30.26 **(1)**. Adding three points gave a 33.26 entry **(2)**.

Gol, a Brazil-based carrier that was experiencing rapid growth, climbed past the buy point on Oct. 14 in breakout-like action. Volume was lukewarm on the day of the breakout as shares jumped nearly 5%, but it was more than double its average a few days later **(3)** . The entry ended up being nearly two points lower than the standard double-bottom buy point.

Gol rallied 148% until peaking in May 2006.

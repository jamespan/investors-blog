A market correction is sort of like a lightning storm. You can't say exactly how bad things are going to get, so you shouldn't be out there. You wait for clear skies.

  

The follow-through day is the clear-skies signal, but that doesn't mean you won't occasionally get a false positive.

  

So how can you recognize quickly that a new rally will fail?

  

Before we answer, let's clarify how a new rally is identified.

  

The follow-through day is a timing mechanism discovered by studying major market bottoms over the past century. Over that period, there has never been a bull market that did not begin with a follow-through. Yet not all follow-throughs lead to a successful uptrend.

  

When a market is in a correction, you are looking for convincing evidence that a new uptrend has begun. After making a low, any up day in a major index is the start of an attempted rally.

  

As long as the index doesn't undercut the low, the attempted rally continues. On Day 4 or later, you are looking for the index to rise sharply in volume up from the previous session. That is the follow-through day.

  

On and after the follow-through day, you can buy fundamentally strong stocks that are breaking out of bases in strong volume.

  

A follow-through day that fails will usually give warning signs. Here are a few common red flags:

  

•Distribution days immediately after the follow-through day. A distribution day involves a decline in a major index in higher volume than the prior day's level. It indicates institutional selling. IBD research suggests that a distribution day in the first two days after a follow-through day is very bad. If the distribution day occurs three days after the follow-through, this is also troubling but to a lesser degree.

  

•Few stocks are breaking out. A shortage of fundamentally strong stocks breaking out should make you wary. A strong uptrend will often feature a few strong stocks breaking out before the follow-through day. They will often be in a buy zone when the follow-through occurs. If you don't see a follow-through with some breakouts, something's wrong.

  

• Stocks stall on the breakout. The proper way to open a position is to take a half-position on the breakout, then add 30% after the stock rises 2% to 2.5%, then complete the position when the stock is up 4% to 5%. If the stock stalls after you take a half-position, and you are unable to complete the purchase, something's not right.

  

•Leaders break out and quickly fail. A healthy uptrend often creates regrets. If you delay buying on the breakout, the stock becomes extended quickly and you're left wishing you had acted. But if the top-rated stocks are breaking down immediately, that tells you something negative about the general market.

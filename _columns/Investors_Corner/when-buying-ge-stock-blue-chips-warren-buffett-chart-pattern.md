When **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), a [blue chip](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/blue-chip-stock-dow-dia-warren-buffett/) among blue chip stocks, falls 89% from its all-time peak, you might be tempted to put on your Warren Buffett cap and back up the truck.




But are you a disciplined investor in growth stocks? Do you employ the [CAN SLIM seven-point method for success](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/)? If yes, then wait for a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) to flash before you risk money.


A [savvy entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) emerges when a [good base forms](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). In GE's case, what base could form?


After such a deep decline, look for [the bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/).

This pattern forms after a stock has dropped severely, typically 50% or more, from a 52-week high. At some point, the selling stampede ends. Sellers get exhausted. Then institutional greed outweighs the fearful. A [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) begins to take shape.


When To Buy GE Stock: First, Sidestep The Decline
-------------------------------------------------


After the stock bottoms out, it must form the right side of the base. It could transform into a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) or [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). Or a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) may form. These patterns build the foundation upon which a stock can then break out and reach 52-week highs.


If you think a stock is primed for a [true breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), do this first. See how far it's trading below the 52-week high. Is it between 5% and 15%? That's good. It means the stock has done the grueling work of plowing through an [overhead supply of disgruntled shareholders](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) eager to dump shares in order to cut losses short or break even.



GE plunged from 15.59 to 6.66, down 57%. But it has no doubt powered sharply higher since it hit bottom on Dec. 11 last year. A 76% rally off the 6.66 low definitely meets the requirement that a stock rise at least 30% before a new base forms.


Since then, GE has corrected 25%. Perfectly normal drop for a cup or a double bottom. But the stock has only recently retaken its 50-day moving average. Shares still trade 34% below a 52-week high of 15.59. It's still base-building time. GE needs more work before a [potential breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) occurs.


[IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) shows poor ratings: a 21 for Relative Strength and a 23 Earnings Per Share Rating. Will GE become a classic turnaround? The Street sees earnings up 24% to 72 cents a share in 2020 after falling 15% this year.


When Was It Time To Sell GE?
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wIC_ge051319-300x169.jpg)The accompanying chart shows when it was time to sell GE shares. When GE failed to gain traction after a December 2016 breakout, two sell rules triggered.


The first: GE undercut its [10-week moving average in heavy weekly turnover](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) and failed to recover **(1)**. The second: It dropped 8% below a 32.10 buy point in a flawed cup with upward-wedging handle, forcing investors who bought to [cut losses short](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) **(2)**.

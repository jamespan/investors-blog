By the time a stock has formed a double-bottom base, many investors have left the scene of what looks like an accident.


The double-bottom base involves an initial decline, a partial rebound and then a deeper decline. The second shakeout is often enough to drive out weak holders and scare away potential buyers.


The final push of the pattern is a second rebound that completes the W-shaped pattern. The middle peak plus 10 cents is the buy point.


Just as some folks look sloppy no matter what they wear (think actor Nick Nolte), the double-bottom base has a slovenly look.


The disheveled appearance makes the pattern easy to overlook. Often, however, the market will give an investor an early heads-up.


Double-bottom bases tend to form during market choppiness. Sometimes the indexes themselves will form a W-like pattern. When an investor sees that occurring, he or she should be on the lookout for stocks forming the same pattern.


Another reason the double bottom can be overlooked is because sometimes they begin as a failure. An investor sees what looks like a cup forming and jumps in early, only to be chased out by a sharp decline.


Cheating by buying a cup base early is a bad idea, but it's double trouble when the pattern is a double-bottom base in the making. Such an investor will get chased out and likely won't stay tuned to see the true buy point emerge.


Investors who see a double bottom developing also shouldn't step in early. The second leg can keep going south and never develop into a W pattern.


After peaking on May 22 of this year, the S&P 500 formed a rough double-bottom pattern. The resumed uptrend signal came on July 11, just as the index crossed the middle peak.


The Nasdaq formed a similar pattern, though a little less defined.


China-based online discount retailer **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) sketched a double bottom and cleared the 34.09 buy point in heavy volume July 17 â€” four days after the uptrend resumed.


The March 2012 initial public offering, which trades on the NYSE, reached the 20% profit level five days after its breakout **(1)** . This triggered IBD's eight-week hold rule.


The stock never sent a sell signal in that period and recently rose as much as 87% above the buy point.

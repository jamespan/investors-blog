If you're looking for laughs, the 1-star reviews on Amazon.com for literary classics are a hoot. Where else would you learn that Flannery O'Connor is a "sadist" or that Sherwood Anderson's "Winesburg, Ohio" is "an instrument of torture?"

The same is true for great books on investing. If a reader is thinly educated on the stock market, peculiar judgments will follow.

Before we look at a few one and two star commentaries on books on investing, keep this in mind. Different approaches to investing can and do work.

Jesse Livermore, Gerald Loeb and William O'Neil comprise one tradition — precise market timing, growth investing and [cutting losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Benjamin Graham and his student Warren Buffett are in the value camp — choose right and sit tight. Peter Lynch carved a third way in GARP, or "growth at a reasonable price."

The sad and disturbing part for the one- or two-star reviewers is that they don't understand a basic truth about great books: You don't judge the great book. The great book judges you.

## Best Investing Books For Beginners: First, The Wacky Theories

Let's take a look at the one- or two-star reactions to William J. O'Neil's "How To Make Money In Stocks." Reader comments are in italics.

_"Horrible … wacky theories that I guess work for him."_ O'Neil's so-called wacky theories have served him well. Early success allowed O'Neil to become the then-youngest investor to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1963, he launched [William O'Neil + Co.](https://www.williamoneil.com/about-us/50-year-heritage/1960/), providing data and analysis today to around 400 global institutional clients, including at one time the Vatican. In 1984, O'Neil used part of his stock-market profits (cash, no loans) to start up what eventually became Investor's Business Daily and Investors.com.

In 2016, the Investor's Business Daily print newspaper transformed into a weekly paper.

## Useless, Or Huge Gains?

_"The information contained is completely useless."_ Apparently the reader didn't read past Page 5. Page 6 of the fourth edition book notes the performance of two of O'Neil's in-house money managers. One turned in a more than 1,000% return in 1999, a year when the Nasdaq rose 86%. The other gained more than 1,300% in 1998-2003. Useless? Really? Gil Morales, a former money manager for O'Neil, said this about O'Neil in [a 2008 interview](https://seekingalpha.com/article/83581-buffett-lynch-morales-q-and-a-with-gil-morales) with Seeking Alpha. "Bill is in my view the true 'greatest investor who ever lived,' given that his CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over a very long period of time extending back into the late 1950s is over 40%, and he has dealt with some very large asset sizes."

_"Is he trying to sell something here or what?"_ Yes, O'Neil is a capitalist and that's a good thing. The original inspiration for starting a financial newspaper is that much of the data O'Neil needed for his own trading was hard to come by. For example, daily volume on individual stocks was not readily available. Ditto much of the other data at Investors.com. Be grateful that O'Neil is willing to sell the data.

## Strange Reviews For Best Investment Books

Let's look at another investing classic: "The Battle for Investment Survival" by [Gerald Loeb](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/why-gerald-loebs-battle-for-investment-survival-rings-true-in-todays-markets/), who died in 1974. His book also attracted some strange reviews.

*"This book is outdated and provides horrible financial advice. The author is against diversification."* Loeb, a partner at E.F. Hutton, wrote his book in 1935, six years after the 1929 crash. Diversification protected no one in 1929 nor did it protect many in the last major bear markets of 2000-02 and 2007-09.

_"I don't have a clew (sic) why O'Neill (sic) liked this one so much."_ Like O'Neil, Loeb was a market timer. [Cutting losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) before they get too big is key. Loeb had plenty of clues to investing intelligently and so does O'Neil.

For the second to last word, let's go to a quote from an April 2014 [interview with O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/).

"Everyone and his brother has written a book on investing," O'Neil said. "Find out who is successful in a field, and if they've written a book, then the writing is from somebody who's been there, done that and been successful in that field. That, I think, is the whole key."

In O'Neil's book "24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success," published in 2000, he lists 10 books worth reading. They include "How to Trade in Stocks" by Livermore, "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" by Edwin Lefevre, "How I Made \$2,000,000 In The Stock Market" by Nicolas Darvas, "My Own Story" by Bernard Baruch, and "One Up on Wall Street" by Lynch.

And the last word: The best investment books deserves a thoughtful read. For instance, the best way to read "How To Make Money In Stocks" is once from start to finish and then to read two pages closely every workday for the rest of your investing life. Two pages per workday will cover the whole book in a year.

**In Search of CAN SLIM:** [Fourth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/607647/201204171805/in-search-of-can-slim.aspx)


Among the seven CAN SLIM factors, the S is the poor stepchild.


It perhaps doesn't get the attention that earnings, the "new" factor and the other elements enjoy.


Yet, supply and demand for shares are critical. Without the S, a stock deserves skepticism. It's like an engine that has torque vs. one that merely runs fast.


Do you want your stocks to have the power and speed of a Mack truck or the powerless speed of a child's remote-control toy?


A rapid price run-up in a thinly traded stock over a short period means little and can easily flip the other way, just as quickly as a remote-controlled toy can be turned on its side.


Yet, some investors actually prefer the little stocks. They think they might become big winners. This is wishful thinking. The probability of identifying such a stock is infinitesimally small. The investor is better off looking at what's strong now, not what might pan out sometime in the future.


The S factor is about strong volume and strong buying demand, which matter in the here and now.


It makes a long price run in a stock more likely, and it makes the run smoother and more stable.


Where can the investor find information on the S factor in IBD's print version and its website, Investors.com?


Here are a few features to check daily or weekly:


• **Accumulation-Distribution Rating**: This proprietary gauge measures the price and volume action over about 12 weeks. A strong rating (A or B) points to institutional demand for the stock. A C grade suggests a balance between buyers and sellers.


A weak rating (D or E) points to active institutional selling of shares. This rating is found in the stock tables in the newspaper, [Stock Checkup](https://www.investors.com/StockResearch/StockCheckup.aspx) at Investors.com, MarketSmith and Leaderboard.


• **Up-Down Volume**: This 50-day ratio divides the total volume on up days by the total volume on down days. Anything above 1.0 points to solid demand for the stock. The ratio is [found in Stock Checkup](https://www.investors.com/StockResearch/StockCheckup.aspx) at Investors.com, MarketSmith and Leaderboard.


• **Supply-Demand Rating**: This screen weighs institutional demand by identifying stocks with unusually busy trading activity in relation to their supply of shares. Stocks in this screen must be top-rated. The screen appears in the B section of IBD but only occasionally, because there are times when no stocks meet the stringent requirements.


• **Weekly Stocks On The Move**: This list, which appears in Monday's IBD, features stocks with heavy weekly volume vs. their 10-week average volume.


• **NYSE + Nasdaq Stocks On The Move**: This list is similar to the weekly, except it deals with daily action. The screen appears in the B section and on the home page of Investors.com.

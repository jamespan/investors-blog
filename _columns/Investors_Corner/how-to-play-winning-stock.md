A leading stock that comes from the turnaround camp poses a challenge.

  

The individual investor must recognize the improvement quickly enough to get most of the ride up, but not so quickly that he or she is sitting on dead money for months or even years.

  

This was the challenge with **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)), a big winner in 2014. How could this stock have been played?

  

When looking at a potential turnaround, it's good to remember that not all of them work out. An investor can trim the failure rate with a few key questions.

  

• **Are there any new factors at work?** Southwest had several. The U.S. airline industry was undergoing a consolidation — a trend that began in 2008, when Delta and Northwest agreed to combine. The trend eventually left strong U.S. players in the industry with a bigger share of the pie and the ability to raise prices.

  

Another factor was the price of fuel. Crude oil prices began to lose their price momentum beginning in May 2011, when oil ended a virtually straightup move after the 2008-09 recession. Choppy price action followed but that ended with the 2014 meltdown in prices. This trend lowered costs for airlines.

  

Also, Southwest's CEO Gary Kelly finally got the payoff for his fight since 2004 against crony business interests. The Wright Amendment had barred Southwest from making direct flights to some choice locations out of Love Field — an anti-market gift to Dallas-Fort Worth airport. Kelly won, and the ban ended in October.

  

• **Has there been a turnaround in annual earnings?** Southwest Air's turnabout in annual EPS began in 2012. After earnings declined 42% in 2011, they rebounded with a 30% gain in 2012 and 100% in 2013.

  

If an investor concluded that 2014 would be too late to play the stock, he or she would've been wrong. Southwest's stock fell 34% in 2011, rose 20% in 2012, gained 84% in 2013 and surged 129% in 2014.

  

The lesson: Let the stock prove itself.

  

• **What about quarterly earnings?** Southwest's EPS declined on a year-ago basis for four quarters beginning in mid-2011. Clearly, that was no time to buy the stock. In the second quarter of 2012, earnings jumped 140%. One good quarter, though, often isn't enough to drive sustained price gains in a stock.

  

The stock broke out in September 2013, when Southwest had additional positive quarters behind it. September 2013 also was the first breakout that was well above \$10 a share.

  

The lesson: Let the chart prove itself.

  

• **Is the stock offering second chances?** Most quality stocks offer more than one chance to get in. If an investor didn't buy Southwest's September 2013 breakout, new opportunities emerged.

  

In January 2014, Southwest cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern **(1)** at 19.10. Normally, this is a place to add a small amount of shares to an existing position initiated on a base breakout. However, investors are free to reverse the process. A small initial position could've been established while an investor waited for a new base.

  

Southwest formed a flat base and cleared the pattern in February. The buy point was 22.20. From there, Southwest rose as much as 95%.

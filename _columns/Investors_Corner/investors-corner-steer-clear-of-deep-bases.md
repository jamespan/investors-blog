A proper base represents a stock catching its breath before resuming an uptrend.

  

It's just a break. You could even think of it as a "pause that refreshes," borrowing that old Coca-Cola slogan.

  

With that in mind, always look for a modest correction within any base. For example, a cup-without-handle or cup-with-handle base is typically no more than 35% deep. That means the stock corrects by that percentage or less from the pattern's top to its trough.

  

Then there are the shallower bases, such as the square box or flat base. They are usually no more than 15% deep.

  

Be wary of bases that are too deep. After some practice, IBD-style investors can spot overly deep bases pretty quickly.

  

Rather than a pause in an uptrend, these patterns look more like long, painful, near-death experiences.

  

They often happen after a stock's already enjoyed a big advance. In other words, too-deep bases frequently occur with riskier, later-stage bases.

  

In 2000, dozens of former tech leaders etched deep cup bases.

  

When these ex-leaders, such as **JDS Uniphase** ([JDSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JDSU)), attempted to leap to new highs, the breakouts didn't work out.

  

Ahead of another bear market — the one in 2007 and 2008 — **U.S. Global Investors** ([GROW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GROW)) exhibited similar action.

  

The asset manager had enjoyed a huge run in 2006. It hit a peak in January 2007 and then pulled back sharply.

  

U.S. Global's correction ended up being too deep for a proper base. It was 52% deep from top to bottom. This action indicated that investors sold shares with gusto.

  

Still, the base may have looked promising around April 2007, at least to the untrained eye. It was resembling a cup-with-handle pattern **1**.

  

The stock's base-building effort ended up unraveling in the week ended May 11, 2007.

  

During that week, U.S. Global sliced through its 10-week moving average in strong and higher volume, losing 20% for the week **2**.

  

Note that the stock also displayed some characteristics of a climax run as it approached its peak in January 2007.

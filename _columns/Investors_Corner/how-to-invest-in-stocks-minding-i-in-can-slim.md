When learning how to invest in stocks, it's good to keep in mind that no matter how complicated the stock market might seem, the price of a stock always comes down to a matter of supply and demand: How many shares are available, and how much investors are willing to spend to get their hands on some of those shares.

Institutional investors, which include hedge funds, mutual funds, banks, insurers and others, typically have the deepest pockets and the biggest hands on the market. Many refer to them as the smart money. That's why monitoring their activity is a central tenet of understanding how to invest in stocks, and why the ["I" in the CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/)Â investment strategy stands for institutional support.

One quick angle into institutional sponsorship is through [IBD's Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-kirkland-lake-gold-ltd-kl.aspx) function. **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) and **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)), for example, are two recent highfliers among [IBD 50 stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). Atlassian shows an [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-funds-are-buying/) of B-. Kirkland Lake's A/D Rating, which tracks 13 weeks of price-and-volume action, is a B+. That's a pretty subtle difference.

But the Checkup for Atlassian also shows the percentage of funds owning the stock decreased 2% in the most recent quarter. The next line, showing the number of recent quarters in which funds increased ownership, is zero.

That does not necessarily mean funds are selling. The B- A/D Rating suggest funds are simply sitting on their positions, not adding new shares.

For Kirkland, however, [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-kirkland-lake-gold-ltd-kl.aspx) shows a 9% increase in the number of funds owning the stock. That number has increased for eight straight quarters.

## How To Invest In Stocks: Seeing Volume In Charts

As investors learn [the CAN SLIM ropes](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) and better understand how to invest in stocks, they begin to see institutional buying and selling reflected in a [stock chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY). Strong institutional buying is considered accumulation; unusually heavy selling is distribution.

These measures are [particularly important when a stock is building a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-look-for-solid-accumulation-in-a-base/). It is helpful to understand how much accumulation vs. distribution is taking place during the base-building process. Accumulation suggests an ongoing tightening of supply, squeezing the stock toward a higher-voltage breakout.

Where are the indicators? [Look at the chart for any stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at Investors.com. Along the bottom runs a row of vertical blue and red bars. Blue indicates a price increase that day or week. Red is a price decrease. The height of the bar reflects the number or volume of shares traded during that day or week. The red line snaking across the top of the bars is the 50-day moving average.

At the most basic level, blue bars rising above the 50-day average line indicate accumulation by institutions. Red bars rising above the line denote distribution.

But there are shades of nuance within those basic rules. On a weekly chart, for example, if a stock closes in the upper 60% of its trading range for the week, even if it was a down week, you still consider that accumulation, provided volume is above average for the week. This is especially true when it happens in the left (declining) side of the base.

A daily chart can also show accumulation on a price decrease, so long as the stock closes high in the day's range and volume is above average. In this way, even red bars can show accumulation.

Within a base, when days or weeks of accumulation outnumber those of distribution, it signals tightening supply. This is particularly telling when days or weeks of accumulation increase as the stock climbs the right side of the base, and into a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

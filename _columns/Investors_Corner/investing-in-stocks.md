When a young person decides to start investing in stocks, several questions must be answered. In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William O'Neil noted that there are many choices available to the investor.




Some of those choices are "overly risky, extremely complicated, or unnecessarily distracting and less rewarding," O'Neil writes. Keeping things simple can be an advantage.


The first decision for rookie investors is to decide, or admit, how much time they are willing and able to put into stock research. For some people, the answer is zero.


**Index Stock Funds:** In the case of the time-strapped investor, buying an index-tracking ETF (exchange traded fund) and adding to it regularly might be the answer. The Nasdaq 100-based Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), S&P 500-tied SPDR S&P 500 ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) and Dow Jones industrial average-based SPDR Dow Jones ([DIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIA)) are the main vehicles.


The Dow is the most conservative and offers the biggest dividend yield. The Nasdaq is more aggressive, given its technology bias. The S&P 500 is broader — for example, it includes bank, oil and utility stocks which the Nasdaq does not.


**Aggressive Funds:** If a fund investor is more aggressive, two options are available. The Innovator IBD 50 Fund ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)) is an exchanged-traded fund built on the IBD 50. The Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ([BOUT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BOUT)) is constructed with stocks that have broken out.


Buying Individual Stocks
------------------------


For new investors who prefer to invest in individual stocks, several issues must be settled before they act.


**How Many Stocks To Own:** IBD-style investors generally prefer to concentrate on no more than five or six top-rated stocks. As a [stock market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) emerges, the investor can up exposure in 20% chunks from their watch list. If the market comes under pressure or switches to correction, they can build cash in 20% chunks.


O'Neil writes, "Even investors with portfolios of more than a million dollars need not own more than six or seven well-selected securities. If you're uncomfortable or nervous with only six or seven, then own ten. But owning 30 or 40 could be a problem."


Here's another tip: If concentrated investing sounds too scary, answer this question truthfully: Has the investor's research truly been thorough? Sometimes that nervousness isn't about too much concentration but too little research.


**Should The Rookie Use Margin?** Inexperienced investors are wise to learn with their own money. They will make mistakes. After the investor gains experience, the situation changes. "Generally, margin buying should be done by younger investors who are still working," O'Neil writes. The young have more time to repair mistakes.


According to O'Neil, "The best time to use margin is generally during the first two years of a new bull market."


**Should The New Investor Buy IPOs?** The lack of a trading history can make the initial public offering harder to read.


"Once a new issue has been trading in the market for one, two, or three months or more, you have valuable price and volume data that you can use to better the judge the situation," O'Neil writes.


Say Yes To Buying A Home
------------------------


**What About Real Estate?** Many people wouldn't put William O'Neil and the words "real estate" in the same sentence. But O'Neil offers some sound real estate advice in his book.


"No one should ever buy a home unless he can come up with a down payment of at least 5%, 10%, or 20% on his own and has a relatively secure job. You need to earn and save toward your homebuying goal," O'Neil writes.

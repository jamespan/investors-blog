Recognizing a buy point after a stock forms a proper base isn't hard. Sometimes, though, alternative buy points appear but aren't so obvious. Learning to spot them can result in larger profits. A recent Investor's Corner discussed trend lines as a way to identify a more aggressive entry in a stock. You can find an early buy point by drawing a downward-sloping trend line across the high points in a base. Start at the left-side high and connect at least two near-term high points on the chart.

  

For example, the buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern is 10 cents above the high of the handle, but drawing a trend line from the left-side high and across other peaks can yield a lower buy point.

  

In a flat base, the buy point is usually 10 cents above the high of the base, but the pattern has been known to serve up earlier entries.

  

**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) provided a recent example. In the base that it formed earlier this year, the conventional buy point was 63.30. But resistance in the middle of the pattern created an alternative entry at 60.09. The stock made solid gains from both entries.

  

Meanwhile, a double-bottom pattern, which has the appearance of the letter W, can sometimes yield an early entry in the form of a shakeout-plus-three pattern.

  

In a double bottom, the ideal time to buy shares is when the stock crosses 10 cents above the middle peak between the two lows.

  

The shakeout-plus-three is rare. When it does appear, you can find an earlier buy point than a typical double-bottom base, buying as the stock is rising from its lows rather than waiting until it hits the middle peak.

  

As with a double bottom, the shakeout-plus-three pattern has two lows, with the second low undercutting the first. Add three points to the price of the first low.

  

If the stock rushes past this price on huge volume, it is breaking out, and you can consider buying shares.

  

When the stock is higher-priced, say 80 to 100 a share, add at least six points to the first low. The idea is to keep the "plus three" part of the pattern at a reasonable proportion to the base.

  

Take a look at **Avid Technology** ([AVID](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVID)) just after the start of the bull market in 2003. The stock hit a low of 18.76 and another low of 16.76. The second low undercut the first, serving to shake out sellers.

  

The shakeout-plus-three buy point was found by adding three points to the first low of 18.76. Avid cleared the 21.76 buy point on March 25.

  

It provided an early entry because Avid made significant strides before it finally cleared the conventional double-bottom buy point of 23.56 **(1)**.

  

It eventually broke out over that buy point in heavy volume on April 2 **(2)**.

  

For another example, check out retailer **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)). Soon after its [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) in May 2005, it cleared a shakeout-plus-three buy point of 31.06. The early buy point was well below a later handle buy point of 34.

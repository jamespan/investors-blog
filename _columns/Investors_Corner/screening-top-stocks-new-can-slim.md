It's easy to forget when looking at [stock charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) that what often drives extraordinary performance by the top growth stocks is something far more basic, something that many take for granted: innovation. Something new.


It's the [N in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/).




Many if not most of the companies that appear on IBD's high-performance [stock lists](http://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/), including the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [IBD Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Stock Spotlight](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) and others, are built on innovation. They're doing something entirely new.


Either they have a new product or service, or new talented management is taking over. New industry conditions may also be emerging. But something new and successful is going on, and the market recognizes it.

A stock that makes new highs in price, 52-week or all-time, also satisfies the requirement.


In some cases, companies are blazing an entirely new trail by creating something that didn't exist before. For this, think **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), whose co-founder Steve Jobs essentially re-invented the global smartphone industry and fueled major change to other big products.



In other cases, it's someone rethinking old ways of doing things in a radical new way. For this, think Sam Walton, whose **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) discount concept revolutionized American retailing. Its everyday low prices were so successful, say economists, they helped lower inflation across the country in recent decades by pressuring others to cut prices too.


Is the next Apple or Walmart on today's [IBD stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/)? Possibly. At least, it isn't tough to find innovators, companies doing something really new. It's the 'N' in the seven-step [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) stock selection method pioneered by [IBD founder William J. O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/).


Top Growth Stocks And The 'N' In CAN SLIM Investing
---------------------------------------------------



Consider **Match** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)), the lonely hearts social media site that seeks to match up people based on a variety of interests. Others do the same thing of course, but Match had the insight of having multiple high-traffic sites and of going global. Today, it operates in some 40 countries.


Its main product is [the racy Tinder app](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/match-stock-tied-to-tinder-overseas-growth-as-cultural-taboos-crumble/), which Dallas-based Match markets heavily in overseas markets, including fast-growing India. A major shareholder in Match is IAC, which owns about 80% of its shares.


Match's Tinder had 4.3 million subscribers as of the end of last year, up from 1.2 million a year earlier. It expects to add another million this year. But it faces growing competition overseas and in the U.S. from Facebook and Bumble.


Match has excellent IBD ratings. They include a Composite Rating of 91 as of Sept. 23, a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96, and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/) of 81. Match emerged from a lengthy 20-week cup base, broke through a 58.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), and began to form a small [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). It's now trying to race past a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 60.02.


IBD Stock Lists: Finding Innovators
-----------------------------------


Match was a former member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) earlier this year.


Finally, there's **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), which has become the Walmart of fitness clubs. That is, it's an old concept, done new. Most fitness clubs rely on users paying fairly hefty annual fees, and then not really using the lavish facilities. Planet Fitness went the other route: It cut costs to the bone at its no-frills fitness centers, and passed the savings on to their users in the form of ultra-low monthly fees.



Its advertising promises, "Super friendly staff. And the home of the Judgement Free Zone. All just \$10 a month." Sounds simple, but it works. From 2016 to 2018, PLNT averaged 48% EPS growth. This year, that's expected to slow some to 26% growth in 2019 and 22% growth in 2020. But both estimates have been rising.


Planet Fitness has been in a sharp correction lately. Therefore, the stock shows a lowly 49 Composite Rating. It also gets an 98 [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/) and a 34 Relative Strength as of Sept. 23.  The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) currently ranks quite low in the Leisure-Services Group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


Its shares cleared a 53.51 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) coming out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) last November and ripped 53% higher to a new high of 81.90 in mid-June. For now, that's turned out to be the latest peak. After a breakout, it makes sense to [take some profits when the advance reaches 20% to 25% or more](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


In August, the stock [plowed beneath its 50-day moving average in big volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). It's now facing a critical test of support at the long-term 200-day moving average.

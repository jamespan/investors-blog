  Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Shows Why A Breakout From A Deep Cup Base Can Succeed

You know the witticism: The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Undeniably true in the stock market.




So, what is interesting about the new emerging leaders after the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/)? Quite a number of top growth stocks fell much more than the 35% shellacking of the S&P 500 from its February high, or the 43% bloodbath in the Russell 2000. But they managed to finish [deep-cup bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) and break out. Some gains have been darn impressive.


One lesson from the market in 2020? Growth stocks fall harder than the major equity indexes, as they usually do in corrections or bear markets. But heavy attraction to companies that change the way we live, work and play will never cease. That's why leading stocks that suffer abnormally deep declines can still make [strong breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


One panelist on the [IBD Live daily show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;src=A00280&amp;refcode=post|twtr|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|392958) recently recalled a [William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) quip: It's not the chart that moves the stock.


What does? Huge profit and sales growth. [Leadership in a dynamic industry](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/leader-laggard/), and tons of serious sponsorship from mutual funds, banks, pension funds, insurance giants and the like. In other words, every aspect of [IBD's CAN SLIM investing strategy](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) comes into play.

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally And Shopify Stock
------------------------------------------------


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ICshop051820-300x161.jpg)Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) is helping more than 1 million small merchants become a force in e-commerce. Its latest [nine-week cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) featured an almost 49% drop from the cup's left-side high of 593.89 to the bottom of 305.30. Scary. Why? Shopify had to nearly double in price just to get within an arm's length of that old peak. In contrast, the prior base showed a 31% correction from head to toe **(1)**. Much more normal.


Yet the latest pattern and the weekly chart showed many bullish traits.


For starters, at the bottom of the base, Shopify rebounded hard and ended in the upper half of the week's price range. That signified institutional support. Heavy volume that week narrated a big shakeout of weak holders **(2)**.


Then the next week saw SHOP fly 22% higher **(3)** in volume that climbed 17% above its 10-week moving average. Institutions were accumulating. Later, three big up weeks in a row **(4)** reaffirmed a strong rebound in demand.

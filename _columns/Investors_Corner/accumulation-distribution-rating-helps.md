For decades, IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil has developed proprietary ratings to help investors find and analyze stocks with the best fundamental and technical characteristics.

The prior two columns discussed the EPS and [RS ratings](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/790139-how-to-invest-in-stocks.htm). The Accumulation/Distribution Rating falls on the technical side.

It tells investors whether big investors are accumulating the stock or selling it.

Obviously, the individual investor wants to be on the side of the big money. Long-term accumulation fuels a good stock's breakout.

An A or B rating indicates that the stock big investors are buying the stock. C is neutral, and a D or E rating means that the big investors are selling the stock. You can find this rating every day in the stock research tables (starting on this page).

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating does its job by analyzing a stock's price and volume action over the past 13 weeks. It counts as signs of accumulation the days when a stock rises on high volume and marks as signs of distribution the days when the stock is down on high volume.

Use this rating in conjunction with a stock's daily and weekly charts. Only on a stock chart can you see how a stock finishes each trading day. Does it rise sharply, finishing almost at the top of its daily range in big volume? If so, the institutions have a big appetite for the stock and are willing to bid it higher.

How about when a stock closes with a gain but near the low of its daily range? It could be a negative sign: sellers appeared as the stock rose during the day.

The same applies as the stock declines. Does it finish the day near the top of its daily range? That's an upside reversal and considered bullish.

**Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), a Chinese Internet firm, made a big move in 2010 and 2011. Sina broke out of a cup-with-handle base in huge trade during the week that ended Sept. 17, 2010. At the end of the week, Sina had an Acc/Dis grade of A-.

A close look at the base showed numerous days and weeks when the stock rose in above-average volume, especially on the right side of the base. That's confirmation of heavy buying by the big funds.

The rating is not as valuable a tool for deciding when to sell a stock. A big winner may maintain a high rating even after it has shown topping signs. When Sina topped on April 19, 2011, at 147.12 after a 220% rise **(1)**, its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was still an A+.

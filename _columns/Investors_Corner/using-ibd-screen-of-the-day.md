A market in correction is the best time for investors to gather and research stocks for their watch lists. But where, among the thousands of stocks on the market, should one start?

  

One fast and effective way to zero in on leading stocks is to use IBD [Screen Center](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?nav=ResearchSC). A "screen" is a software tool that sorts through thousands of stocks in search of those with specific characteristics.

  

The screen center offers six different screen options. Possibly the most powerful of these is Screen of the Day.

  

Screen of the Day is a rotating list of 10 different stock screens created by Investors.com staff. Most of the screens focus on fundamentals, while a couple of them emphasize high-quality sponsorship — a fancy word for robust institutional ownership — and Relative Strength.

  

A list of recent daily screens are available in a pull-down menu, which appears when you hold your cursor over the "Screen of the Day" column heading. In the past week, the daily screens included stocks sorted by financial efficiency, bolting RS lines, big-cap leaders and leaders beating analysts' profit forecasts.

  

Friday's screen searched for stocks with accelerating ownership by mutual funds. The list showed 20 stocks that trade above 15 a share and are owned by an increasing number of mutual funds over the past three quarters. The screen eliminated stocks that trade an average of fewer than 400,000 shares per day and are more than 30% from their 52-week highs.

  

The first version of the list you see is sorted by fundamentals. This shows recent EPS and sales changes by quarter. It also shows the analyst consensus EPS estimate for the pending quarter as well as for the current year.

  

A small window at the top left of the screen says "View By." Click the arrow next to this screen and you will find options to reshuffle the stocks according to their IBD SmartSelect ratings or by technical factors, namely price and volume. Experimenting with these options allows you to adjust the way the list is presented. You can decide which works best for you.

  

To dig deeper into individual stocks, click on the blue-colored checkmark icon in the Tools column to pull up a Stock Checkup. This provides more detailed research on the company. Then, click on the chart icon to see the stock's price performance and whether it's in a base or some kind of secondary buy area.

  

If you're satisfied with the stock, you can click on the plus-sign icon to add it to a watch list on Investors.com and research it further. Keep in mind: Only a small portion of the stocks shown on these screens may turn out to be winners. The research you do beyond the stock screens is critical. And keep reading the Big Picture, today on B2. Always confirm that the market is in a clear uptrend before you buy.

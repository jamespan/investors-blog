Spotting the three-weeks-tight pattern in stock charts isn't so difficult. It's just three straight weeks with narrow changes in each weekly price close. But on that basis alone, you could be finding a lot of faulty patterns.




First, a definition: The [3 weeks tight is a follow-on pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) — an opportunity to buy a small amount of shares when the stock has already advanced from its [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Basically, it represents a brief consolidation in which institutional investors pause their buying, rather than take profits. That results in a weekly price close of no more than 1% to 1.5% (up or down) from the previous week's close, and a similar narrow finish the next week.


The [buy point](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) is the highest price within the pattern, plus 10 cents. As with any follow-on formation, try to buy as close as possible to the buy point. Don't buy too many shares, too; you don't want your average cost in the overall position to rise too quickly.


The price bars on the three weeks should present a sideways or slightly downward-tilting look. An upward-wedging three weeks may not have the same solid frame. And remember, you need to see a weekly chart to identify the 3 weeks tight.

CLOSE




The pattern can be difficult to spot because it forms in the middle of an advance. So, here are some additional characteristics to identify the right ones:


* A 3-weeks-tight that appears late in a stock's long-term advance will make for a poor pattern. Seek those that form after breakouts from [first- or second-stage bases](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/). After the third-stage or any late-stage base, consider any follow-on pattern dubious.
* Weekly price ranges generally shouldn't be wild, even if weekly price closes are narrow.
* Any chart that normally shows tight week-to-week trading is a poor choice for finding a 3-weeks-tight. The pattern simply doesn't stand out in a dull chart.
* Heavy volume in all or most of the three weeks is generally bad, so prefer quiet trading. A weekly bullish price reversal in big volume, however, is a good sign.
* Don't buy a 3-weeks-tight that forms while a stock is still in buy range from its base breakout. By definition, a follow-on pattern occurs only after a stock is extended from its buy range.
* If one or more of the three weeks close low in the weekly price range, treat the pattern with suspicion.


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ICluv111317.jpg)Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) had one of its best runs in 2013 and 2014, a period that saw a few [3-weeks-tight patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) along the way. The airline began its ascent when it broke out of a double-bottom base in September 2013.


After about three months without a break, the stock started trading tightly in the final weeks of December **(1)**. The price differences in those weekly closes were 1.2% and 0.6%, qualifying for a 3-weeks-tight.


That boosted Southwest until it formed a flat base in parts of January and February 2014. With shares cruising from that entry, another 3-weeks-tight formed in late April and May. Each week's close in that series was less than 1% and weekly price bars were attractively narrow.


In July, there was yet another 3-weeks-tight **(2)**. This time, the middle week in the pattern was noticeably wider than the others. Yet, the stock closed high in the price range in heavy volume — a good result.

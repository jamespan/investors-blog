Cups and saucers go together on the dinner table â€” and in the stock market.


The cup-with-handle base is the most common launching pad for winning stocks. A saucer and handle is less common but based on the same logic.


A stock corrects, recovers, has one final shakeout to eliminate weak holders, then blasts into new high territory. The buy point now provides support to the stock.


**Different From A Cup**


Saucers with handles tend to last longer, up to a year, and correct less, maybe 12% to 30%, where a cup could correct 40% to 50% in a volatile market.


The stock market has two ways to shake you out: It can scare you out or it can wear you out. Cups with handles scare you out. Saucers wear you out. It takes great patience to watch a saucer with handle develop. But it can be very rewarding.


It often occurs with big-cap household names that move slowly anyway.


Examples of saucers with handles are **Delta Airlines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) in 1965, **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) in 1982, **Precision Castparts** ([PCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCP)) in 2005 and **AutoZone** ([AZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZO)) in 2010. You can see more examples in William O'Neil's book, "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Because stocks sculpting saucer-with-handle bases move sideways for so long, they sometimes have low Relative Price Strength Ratings.


Such was the case with AutoZone in February 2010. The stock set up in a 41-week saucer-with-handle base that corrected 21%. The proper buy point was 161.43.


A seven-week handle corrected just 6%, within the normal decline for a handle.


The general market was in the middle of a bull market that began in March 2009 **(1)**. But at AutoZone's breakout, the Relative Price Strength Rating was a below-average 47. Low RS ratings are a common feature of many stocks that build long saucer bases. Keep in mind that the RS Rating compares a stock's 12-month price performance with the rest of the market.


A positive feature of the base was the eight straight weeks of gains that made the right side of the base **(2)**. The handle was nicely proportioned to the rest of the base.


It broke out Feb. 16. At the time, AutoZone's Composite Rating was decent at 82. AutoZone also boasted a 92 EPS Rating and an A for its SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity) Rating. Volume was only 33% above average, but the stock went on to rally numerous times in heavy turnover.


Remarkably, it rose for 10 straight weeks after its breakout.


**Fundamental Tailwind**


AutoZone had a major trend on its side. Consumers were keeping their cars longer, because of both a sluggish economy and better-engineered cars. The average car on the road was 11 years old.


In May, AutoZone had its first test of its 10-week moving average **(3)**. The stock found support, then pressed higher.


The stock rose 55% until it gave a sell signal on Jan. 7, 2011, by closing the week below its 50-day moving average on big volume. AutoZone had advanced from its first test of the 50-day line without again venturing below the support line.

  A Flat Base Is A Sign Big Players Won't Sell

When a stock moves up, pauses and does not correct sharply in price, that's good news for the shareholder. The higher prices don't bring out the sellers. Instead, buyers quietly accumulate more shares, preventing a significant downturn.


That's the explanation of the flat base, a common structure found in many of the biggest winning stocks.


It typically appears on stock charts as a second base, built soon after a stock advances from a cup, cup-with-handle or double-bottom base. It must form over at least five weeks and must not correct more than 10% to 15% from the highest price within the base to the lowest price.


The buy point is 10 cents beyond the high point of the flat base's left side.


As with other bases, the potential buyer should analyze the daily and weekly charts for signs of institutional accumulation. The breakout should occur in volume at least 40% to 50% above its 50-day average.


A breakout from a flat base is an excellent time to jump into a stock you missed on the initial breakout. You could also consider adding a few shares to an already successful position as your confidence grows that you have a long-term winner.


Take the case of **DryShips** ([DRYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRYS)) in early 2007. Since going public in February 2005, the Athens, Greece-based company expanded its fleet of ships from six to 37 by mid-2007.


The company supplied dry-bulk ships on the spot market. Shippers who lock in vessels with multiyear contracts get a discount. But if they need a ship in a pinch, they must pay the spot price, which is volatile and is subject to supply and demand. By 2007, DryShips' fleet was commanding high prices and the stock took off.


The stock headed south soon after and bottomed in May 2006. It moved up and formed a cup-with handle base, breaking out Nov. 24, 2006, with a 14.35 buy point. It moved up 28% in the next six weeks, participating in a broad market rally.


DryShips then paused to build a five-week flat base that corrected just 8%. Daily movements were tight and volume was below average each week during the base.


It broke out past 18.47 on Feb. 20, 2007, with a 6% gain and volume 109% above average (see a daily chart). At the time, the Composite Rating was 88. The Earnings Per Share Rating was 53, and the Relative Price Strength Rating was 96. The relative strength line rose sharply to a new high ahead of the stock.


After a quick retest of the buy point a few days later, the advance resumed. DryShips ran up 25% in three weeks, triggering the eight-week hold rule. This says if a stock advances at least 20% out of a base in one, two or three weeks, it must be held for at least eight weeks to see if it's a good candidate for a long-term hold.


It was. The stock advanced 128% before it paused to build a third-stage base. From there, it advanced another 32% in the first three weeks, again triggering the eight-week hold rule. Again, that was the launching pad for another big advance.


In total, Dryships made a 611% advance from its first flat-base breakout in February until it ultimately topped in November the same year.

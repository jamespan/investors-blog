A market leader will usually offer multiple chances to get on board and build a position in its stock. One of the last favorable opportunities is a leading stock's second trip to the 10-week [moving average](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736316&sourceid=735787) after a breakout.

First, let's define how we're counting the pullbacks. A test of the [10-week line](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/741743-stock-chart-signals.htm) (or the 50-day moving average on a daily chart) below the breakout entry point doesn't count since the stock has actually pulled back into its base.

Start counting when the stock is able to get out of its [base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/746782-how-to-buy-good-stocks.htm) will be in an uptrend at this point and be coming up to meet the stock as it pulls back.

When a market leader is under accumulation, institutions will generally step in and buy shares to support the stock as it declines in price. Many of the biggest stock market winners are able to hold above the 10-week line for the majority of their advance.

Each successive pullback gets trickier to navigate, though, because the stock is further extended from its base and later in its run. Generally, after the second pullback the risk is too high relative to the potential remaining reward to justify buying shares.

Here is a key point: When a stock touches the line multiple times in a short period without moving back to new high territory, it counts as just one pullback.

After a flat-base breakout in July 2013, **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) went on a 73% run over just seven months.

The generic-drug leader's initial test of its 10-week line was below a 133.10 buy point, so it wasn't a proper buy opportunity **(1)** . The first buyable pullback came two months after the breakout **(2)**.

The stock then moved to new highs and then retreated for a second test in October **(3)**. This gave existing shareholders with conviction a second chance to build their position in the stock as it continued to prove itself.

At the second pullback, Actavis had a 99 Composite Rating, 97 EPS Rank and 89 RS Rating. It was featured in [Sector Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/sector-leaders-review.htm) with the chart analysis, "Firms up at 10-week line; 6% past 133.10 flat-base entry." You can initiate a position off a 10-week pullback, but generally you want to use a smaller position size than you would at a base breakout.

Shares found support again in December, but a third pullback to the line is not an ideal entry. By February 2014, the stock showed signs of overheating by crossing an upper channel line.

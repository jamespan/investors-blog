Have you traded in a supercycle bull market before? Do you think another one will come?

  

In October, IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil opined that the market may be headed into a long period of significant gains. A supercycle lasts 12 to 15 years and ties together three normal bull runs that last 3-3/4 years each.

  

Each bull run is followed by a bear market — a correction in which a major stock index falls 20% or more from its peak. A bear market typically lasts eight or nine months.

  

Why do supercycle bulls occur?

  

Ultimately, it's because investors perceive value in equities, even when the market is rolling to new highs. If money flows out of bonds or commodities, and people are hungry for a return on their cash, they often choose stocks. The news that shape a market's overall trend generally arrives a step or two late. Therefore, you must be willing to study the market itself. Make it your primary news source.

  

Use [IBD's Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) every day to uncover the market's news. A supercycle bull will feature deep corrections. 

  

But the Big Picture's analysis of distribution days and follow-throughs will help you time your buys and sells well.

  

You've probably heard someone say that no one really knows we're in a bull market until long after it has started.  That would suggest, then, that 2013 is possibly part of the next supercycle bull. But that also doesn't rule out the possibility of another serious market correction in the future.

  

You can listen to the "news" of one strategist claiming we're embarking on a big new run on equities, or some guru claiming that the U.S. stock market is a house of cards, ready to collapse at the faintest tremor of bad data. The problem: Opinions aren't news. So to make an informed decision, how about taking these steps?

  

1. Clear your mind of all biases. Take the Nasdaq today. Sure, it's had a great run since bottoming out at 1265 in March 2009 **(1)** You might have bias in thinking the market is due for a bear market. But what about the 20.2% decline from July to October 2011? **(2)** Could that have been the "pause" that refreshes?

  

2. Monitor and be mindful of innovations that change the way we live, do business and spend on leisure. Innovations give birth to great new companies and great new investing opportunities.

  

3. Listen to investor psychology. Ask friends and colleagues, "Are you investing in stocks?" If most say no, that's good. These folks can become potential investors. A long bull run needs new buyers.

  

4. Keep a watch list of newer companies that offer breakouts from early-stage bases, sell great new products and post quarter after quarter of healthy top- and bottom-line growth. Spot great bases, then possess the courage to buy when the time is right. These are the real fruits of a long bull market.

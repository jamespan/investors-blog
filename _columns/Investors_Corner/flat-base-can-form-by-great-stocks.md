When a stock starts trading sideways, don't take it off your watch list. It may be forming a flat base.


A flat base is a key chart pattern that great stocks often form before hitting new highs and making big gains. Like its name, a flat base has a flat or boxlike appearance.


It may look like the stock isn't doing much, but this dull action is actually a good thing. The flat base is typically not a first-stage structure. It sometimes forms after a breakout from a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base.


In a flat base, the consolidation lets the stock digest prior gains. Stocks can also form flat bases when the overall market is in a downtrend or can't muster much progress. Last month, **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) started shaping a flat base as the general market correction jarred investors.


A flat base is one of the shorter price patterns. It only needs a minimum of five weeks to take shape. Most other price structures need at least seven weeks. The correction in the base should be no more than 15%. As previously stated, a flat base should have a boxy shape to it. You should be able to draw a rectangle around it.


To get the buy point in a flat base, just add 10 cents to the high of the pattern. Flat bases can also form handles, which may allow for a lower-price entry.


At some point in the consolidation, a stock may poke into new-high territory. But as long as the stock does not make a new closing high for the week, the flat base will still be valid. Either way, volume needs to be at least 40% on a breakout day.


Thanks to red-hot demand for iron ore, Greek dry-bulk carrier **DryShips** ([DRYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRYS)) had a monster run in 2007. The stock blasted out of a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Nov. 24, 2006 **1**. It cruised up 28% before settling into a five-week flat base **2**.


DryShips corrected 11% from its January 2007 peak of 18.37. That was less than the maximum 15% drop a flat base should have.


The stock cleared the 18.47 buy point in the week ended Feb. 23 **3**. Volume was more than double its average on the breakout day. Trade was also much heavier than normal for the week.


In 2007, DryShips' earnings per share rocketed 548% and revenue rose 134%. The stock shot up 128% by May before pulling back to its 10-week line **4**.

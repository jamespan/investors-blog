A two-year period of trading history in **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), one of the super stocks of the late 1980s to late '90s, offers a [great lesson in stock chart analysis](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) for both the new IBD reader and the veteran stock picker.

The lesson: Tight, controlled price action matters. It can spell the difference between a base that fails and a base that wins and makes money for those willing to [learn how to time buys in a stock](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

Bases are simply a visual representation of a stock taking a break from an advance. The most important ones: the [cup with handle](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [flat base](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), [double bottom](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/), [base on base](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/),  [saucer with handle](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/), and high, tight flag. A solid uptrend of at least 30% should precede the base.

Don't forget this: Not all bases work. If a base shows big, wide price moves every week, steer clear. It shows institutional investors are engaged in hand-to-hand combat. A stock looks like it might rise out of that base, then gets swatted down. Consider the first base Microsoft made after the Black Monday crash of Oct. 19, 1987. Notice how the software firm sank 9.8% in the week ended Oct. 16 **(1)**, then collapsed 25% the next week. Volume was huge.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ICmsft112017.jpg)One week later, Microsoft posted a nice reversal, going from as low as 37.25 to as high as 52.25 before finishing the week up 3%. Nice gain, but the swing from low to high was a gigantic 40%. A **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) electric semi truck could roll through that wide space.

That turned out to be the bottom. The next eight months, Microsoft drifted higher. Yet the base was wide and loose. In all, the 37-week cup with handle was riddled with flaws. At least 18 weeks had a price swing, from low to high, topping 10%.

An entire [flat base](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) can fit within a 10% decline.

The long base was lopsided, lacking symmetry. The 53% drop far exceeded the 33% maximum decline seen in most [excellent cup-with-handle patterns](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).

Microsoft formed another long cup. It was too deep. Most of it formed beneath the 10-week moving average, a flaw. A third base **(2)** showed similar problems.

The fourth time? A charm. A symmetrical cup with handle, just 16% deep. How many weeks showed a swing of 10% or more? Just one. In that down week **(3)**, weak holders were shaken out. Volume zoomed. Microsoft ended squarely in the middle of the weekly range. Call it institutional support.

A September breakout past a 61.60 entry (10 cents above a seven-day handle, best seen in a [MarketSmith daily chart](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF)) yielded a 450% gain by the end of 1991.

**IBD's TAKE**: _Using stock charts correctly can help you time your purchases in leading stocks so that you can maximize your gains and minimize losses within a relatively short period of time. Watching for breakouts from key chart patterns during earnings season is especially helpful. In addition to the_ [_flat base_](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) _and the_ [_saucer base_](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/)_, the_ [_cup with handle_](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) _stands out as one of the most critical patterns of human psychology; it visualizes investor fear and greed, hope and denial._

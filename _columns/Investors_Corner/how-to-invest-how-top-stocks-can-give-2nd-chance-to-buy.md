Frustrated that you missed a breakout opportunity to buy that stock you liked so much? Just wait a bit.

IBD research has found that up to 40% of great stocks pull back near to or all the way back to their ideal buy point after a breakout.

Pullbacks are natural. They reflect profit-taking. But if the stock is a true leader, its general uptrend will not be disturbed. So, after a brief shakeout, big winners resume their price runs and hit new highs.

A brief pullback to the ideal entry price offers a second chance to buy or add to a position. If you're down just 2% or 3% in such a situation, don't sell. The 8% stop-loss rule has not been triggered. Also, the pullback will often be a test of the stock's 10-week moving average. Before jumping in, make sure the overall market is in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) by reading the Big Picture column each day. Also, check to see that the stock is in a strong industry group, and that volume dropped off during the pullback. If the stock passes those tests, there's a good chance that it will resume its climb.

**Rackspace Hosting** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)) broke out of a double-bottom base on Sept. 10, 2010, climbing above its 21.46 buy point **(1)** (weekly chart shown). The move came six trading days after the market followed through.

![ICch-RAX-060816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ICch-RAX-060816.jpg)An IBD-style investor could have been forgiven for holding back, since volume was only 13% above average, well below the 40% spike you'd like to see.

Yet the stock kept rising, and volume in subsequent days and weeks picked up. After briefly dipping less than 3% below the 21.46 buy point, it shot up 16% in the week ended Sept. 24 in strong volume **(2)**, giving investors a second chance to buy. On Sept. 28, the shares hit 26.50, 23% above the buy point **(3)**.

Research shows it's risky to buy a stock that's more than 5% beyond its entry point. A pullback could trigger the 8% sell rule before the stock has a chance to rebound.

After the Sept. 28 peak, the stock began pulling back and volume trailed off. On Oct. 19, it tested its 10-week line and reached as low as 21.95 **(4)**, within the permissible buying range of up to 22.53.

Here was another golden chance to buy shares or add to the position.

The stock eventually more than doubled from the second-chance buying opportunity, hitting a peak of 46.49 in May 2011.

On its breakout, Rackspace had strong [IBD ratings](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), including a 98 Composite Rating, a 95 EPS Rating and a 91 for Relative Price Strength.

Stocks had a great week last week. Not only did the [stock market](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) shift back to an uptrend, but the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rallied to new multiyear highs.

Investors should be looking to put leading stocks back into their portfolios. A number of leaders have set up buying opportunities in this week's IBD 50.

**ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)) is in the first test of its 10-week moving average since shooting out of a cup-with-handle base in October.

The stock reversed from a near record high last week, but did so in below-average volume. It still has an up-down volume ratio that's well above 1, signaling that buyers are in control.

**SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) is in buying range from a 57.87 buy point in a flat base within a larger consolidation. The stock broke out March 4 in volume that grew 20% above average. Generally, turnover should be at least 40% above average. Its weekly volume ended above average â€” a positive.

In February, the software maker beat views with fourth-quarter earnings and sales that jumped 24% and 32%, respectively. Analysts expect a 19% gain in earnings this year.

As stated in recent columns, stocks forming basing patterns have been tough to find, but a few showed in this week's list.

**CommVault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) shaped a second-stage flat base near support at its 10-week moving average. The stock snapped a four-week losing streak, but did so in bone-dry turnover.

The maker of backup, recovery and storage software delivered a 33% increase in earnings last year. Growth is expected to pick up to 40% this year.

**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) is a flat base with a 162.87 buy point. The stock has shown smooth action recently and has found support at its 10-week line. But its base is a third-stage structure. Generally, first- or second-stage patterns are preferred.

For the week, the IBD 50 climbed 3.4%, outperforming the Nasdaq's 2.4% gain.

Oil and natural gas firm **Bonanza Creek Energy** ([BCEI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCEI)) surged more than 12% for the week, making it the best performer in the IBD 50 last week. The stock is now 8% past a 35.35 entry from a three-weeks-tight add-on pattern.

**TripAdvisor** ([TRIP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRIP)) was another big mover. It bolted 12% to an all-time high. The stock had a failed breakout from a cup with handle last month, but found support near its 10-week moving average.

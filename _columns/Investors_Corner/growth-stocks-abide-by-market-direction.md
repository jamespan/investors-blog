Picking, researching and analyzing charts of growth stocks all amount to nothing if investors forget one simple rule: Follow the market's direction.




That is why monitoring conditions in the major market indexes is one of the four pillars of [The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/). That pillar — along with [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/), another bedrock element of successful investing — offers a strong reminder that whatever other research and chart reading you get right, it is worthless if you end up betting against the market.


IBD founder William O'Neil made clear, in "[How to Make Money in Stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/)," that investors "absolutely must have a proven, reliable method to accurately determine whether you are in a bull (uptrending) market or a bear (downtrending) market."


The best way to determine the direction of the market, O'Neil said, "is to look carefully at, follow, interpret and understand the daily charts of the three or four major general market averages."


Growth Stocks Abide By Market Direction
---------------------------------------


IBD subscribers receive a close reading on market behavior each day after the market closes from [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/?intcode=qcklnks|nhpqcklnks|artpromo|2020|06|iart|na||215419&src=A00600A). Before the open and during the session, the [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) column provides additional reporting and analysis of the market action.


Plus, each day you'll find the [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), a five-tiered system ranging from 0%-20% to 80%-100%. Found on the homepage of Investors.com and in The Big Picture, checking this level daily helps investors gauge how aggressive or defensive to be.


Over time, in addition to tracking any changes to the recommended exposure level, investors should also learn to understand the main market topping and bottoming signals: distribution days and follow-throughs.


The Big Picture analysis carefully tracks distribution days. Distribution occurs when an index closes lower and volume for the session is higher than the previous day. If an index racks up four or five distribution days, particularly when they occur in a short period, it is a sign of rising pressure on that index to consolidate.


Know Your Distribution, Follow-Through Days
-------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IC_1C072621-249x300.jpg)Therefore, even when growth stocks are often behaving well and sending no distress signals, increases in distribution days often suggest a change in market direction. As distribution day counts pile up, the recommended market exposure level will decline, a sign for investors to reduce their risk.


[Follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) mark another change of direction, the point where a correcting market begins to turn around. Follow-throughs occur when a benchmark index logs a significant gain, more than 1%, in higher volume. Watch for this signal on the fourth day or later of gains from an index low.


An important follow-through occurred following the sharp Covid pandemic-induced market crash. The S&P 500 rallied 2.2% on Nov. 4, 2020 — the day after the U.S. presidential election. The Nasdaq made its own follow-through the next day. Not all follow through succeed. But these ones did. The S&P advanced 38% through the end of 2021, while the Nasdaq gained nearly 33%.

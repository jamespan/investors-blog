Peculiar action in the stock market can seem to make a fool out of the rules. Imagine you've been tracking several top stocks on your watch list. Then one day one of these stocks moves up in strong volume but stays below the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in [a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/).




If you're a rules-based investor, you're not buying because the stock didn't clear [the buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), not even intraday.


You continue to watch the stock.


It then inches above the buy point in quiet volume and, over the next few days, pads the gain in low volume.


Even more frustrating, the stock might [clear the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) without finding strong volume, except for that one day when it fell short of the buy point.


Did the rule let you down? Or is there something else you failed to recognize?


How To Trade Top Stocks: Attain This Skill
------------------------------------------



Often in these situations, rigid thinking is the problem. A flexible mind is necessary to investing.


When an individual investor sees what looks like breakout action before the stock reaches the [conventional buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), that investor needs to study the chart.


The key question is this: Did the stock break above a trend line on the day when price and volume came into the stock?


Sometimes a trend line can be drawn from the left side high to the handle. If the stock crosses above the trend line in strong volume, the action constitutes an early entry. In some cases, it just might be the only entry you will see.


Even if the stock breaks out at the standard buy point, looking for the alternative entry can be useful. If it gets you in the stock a bit early, you are better positioned to sit through minor turbulence.


Why Find An Early Entry Point In Top Stocks
-------------------------------------------


The [8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) may get those who bought at the standard buy point but never reach the early entry.


There's another benefit to the early entry. The question of whether you should act on the early entry or wait for the standard entry is useful in itself. Ask yourself these two questions: How much conviction do I have in this market? How much conviction do I have in this stock?


If stock action forces you to answer the question, it's a good thing.

The stock corrected 46%, which was deep but somewhat less of a concern because initial public offerings tend to be more volatile than a more mature stock.


Mobileye began climbing the right side of the base in March 2015. (Note: The base was large and cannot be completely seen on a [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily), so please go to a [weekly chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=weekly).) In May, the stock began sketching a handle. The handle had a textbook quality: lower lows, quiet volume.


Investors looking for an aggressive entry could've drawn a trend line from the left side high to the high of the handle. This identified a buy point around 46.75.


On June 9, Mobileye cleared the trend line **(1)** in volume 104% above average. Two sessions later, the stock broke past the conventional entry at 48.88 **(2)**.


The Payoff In Buying Early
--------------------------


About 10 weeks later, the aggressive investor had a 38% gain, while those who waited for the standard entry had a 32% gain. The difference wasn't huge, but in investing, you take every edge you can get.

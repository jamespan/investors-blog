What Joe Blow thinks about a stock doesn't matter, unless Mr. Blow is a fund manager with millions of dollars to put behind his opinion.


Institutional money is what drives the market. The goal for the individual investor is to ride the trend.


When considering a stock, the investor should look at how many funds hold shares. Also consider the quality of support. What are the A+ rated funds doing?


A look through IBD's various screens found 10 stocks with signs of exceptional institutional action. Each of the 10 have seen the number of total mutual funds and hedge funds holding shares rise and the overall stake rise in the past three quarters, according to William O'Neil + Co. data.


**UMB Financial** ([UMBF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UMBF)), a Midwest bank: The number of mutual funds and hedge funds holding shares rose from 314 at 2015 year-end to 323, 348 and 357 in subsequent quarters. The overall stake in millions of shares rose from 21.6 to 22.9, 24 and 24.2. Five A+ funds have positions. None cut their stake in Q3.

Perhaps every investor in growth stocks dreams of catching the big winner by getting in at the ground floor.

A purchase of **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), out of a [first-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) in October 1990, could have led to an advance of more than 75,000% in the next 10 years. But how do you know early on if your stock has that potential? How to trade growth stocks that haven't yet proven they can outperform indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average?

The short answer is: You don't.

But portfolio management rules can boost your odds of getting a winner among new initial public offerings. So does the proper chart analysis of a stock when it creates an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).

Edwin Lefevre's classic, "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator," offered the following quote, often attributed to renowned trader Jesse Livermore: "It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting ... Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon."

## A Rule For A Potential Big Winner

Enter IBD's eight-week holding rule, exclusively for IPOs. After a stock has cleared a [narrow IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), watch it closely in the first two weeks of trading. If the breakout holds up and you find yourself with a gain of, say 5% or 10%, hold until the close of Week 8. Then decide whether it's worth holding longer.

In other words, give the new stock a chance to grow. If the stock threatens to turn into a loss, you can always exit the stock before the eight weeks go by. But before making that move, study the action on a weekly chart. A good stock may start the week weak but end strong. It may [bounce off the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/searching-for-a-new-buy-point-watch-tests-of-the-10-week-moving-average/), preserving the run.

## How To Trade Growth Stocks: Factors That Help New IPOs

Two months can seem like an eternity to active traders. But one should remember that successful IPOs generally have a favorable supply-and-demand situation. New IPOs generally show a small float. If the IPO starts getting the attention of institutions, a lot of demand can start chasing limited supply.

As always, if the stock falls 7% to 8% from where you bought it, you should sell it to protect your capital.

The whole point of waiting eight weeks is to increase the odds that you will wind up with a decent cushion of profit. It means a lot for your portfolio management strategy. You can be more aggressive with add-on purchases while maintaining a low average cost. The profit cushion may allow you to hold the stock during its inevitable first major pullback.

## Average Size Of First Pullback

And depending on how quickly the stock runs up, you could easily see it fall as much as 17% from its all-time high, the average size of the first pullback for big winners.

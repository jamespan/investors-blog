  Know When To Invoke The Eight-Week Hold Rule

Everyone wants a red-hot stock and spectacular gains. Yet most stocks don't make the grade.


And some IBD readers may ask: How can you sit for a 100% gain if you have to unload the stock after it reaches a 20% gain?


Here's where the eight-week hold rule offers the chance at staggering riches.


The rule: If your stock surges at least 20% within three weeks of breaking out from a proper base, you should hold on for at least eight weeks.


The fast, solid gain is a sign that big institutions have major designs on the stock. That surge indicates a far-above-average gain in the long run is possible.


The eight-week hold rule also may apply to a rebound from the 10-week moving average â€” but don't look for excuses to interpret the action in favor of invoking the rule. If the stock already has broken out and has started to rise, such a rebound from the 10-week line may be just part of the rally.


Are there exceptions to the eighth-week hold rule? Sure.


Let's say you've bought a fine stock in just the right way. It flies more than 20% in less than three weeks, and you're as happy as a kid with a new puppy.


But as you hold on, sometime in Week 4 or 5 the broad market falls into a correction.


This is a problem, but it's not necessarily a sell signal. Your situation is much like that of holding any good stock when a bad thing happens. You have to be careful and protect what you have.


If you're holding a stock in the eight-week rule, by definition you already have a fat gain. Don't let that profit vanish. Watch it closely.


Maybe you set a stop near a strategic price. Maybe you unload some of the position. Maybe you unload all. There's no hard-and-fast road to take. But you shouldn't sacrifice all your gains in the name of holding on for eight weeks.


Ceradyne, the producer of advanced ceramics for industrial applications, built a deep cup from February to April 2003.


The stock flew past its 11.86 buy point on May 1, and in three weeks soared 27%. Seeing it hit the 20% mark in just six days should have kept you from selling. By the end of the eighth week, Ceradyne hit as high as 17.88, **(1)** up 51%. By the end of 2004, it vaulted 645%.

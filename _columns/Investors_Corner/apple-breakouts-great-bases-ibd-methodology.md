Studying market history makes you, an investor following [The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-in-stocks-investing-for-beginners/), smarter. Will it help you make more money in stocks? Definitely.




One reason? The more charts and bases of top growth stocks you analyze, the easier you'll find it to avoid the breakouts that emerge from poorly formed bases.


Let's look at **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), one of the biggest stock market winners since the bear market ended in 2009. From its late April 2010 peak at 272.46, the stock built a [seven-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The depth of the decline in the base was a reasonable 27%; a drop of more than 33% is a no-no. You don't want the stock to have to work too hard in rebounding back toward the base's left-side peak, and just before [it sets up a possible breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Do you see any flaws?


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ICaapl040218-300x161.png)You may have seen the second down week as strange **(1)**. Indeed, Apple gyrated wildly in the May 6, 2010, flash crash, then fell 9.7% by week's end. The iPhone marketer careened from a high of 267.88 to a low at 199.25, a 34% swing. Prefer calm, relatively controlled action as a stock corrects and forms the pattern.


Flaw No. 2: Within that base, four of the five down weeks in price showed heavy volume vs. the 10-week moving average. It showed just two up weeks in heavy trading. In sum: Institutions sold hard. The left side of the base did feature a support week since Apple closed in the upper 60% of the price range during that flash crash week that ended May 7. Still, the base held a negative accumulation count of minus two.


Flaw No. 3: In the week ended June 18, Apple broke out **(2)** and surpassed the 266.04 buy point (10 cents above the handle's highest price). Yet volume declined vs. the prior week **(3)**. Remember that elderly lady in that classic **Wendy's** ([WEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEN)) TV commercial, asking, "Where's the beef?" Be like her. Always demand, "Where's the volume?" Only once in a while does the volume really come a week or two after the breakout week.


Apple gained 4.9%, then rolled over in less than two weeks' time. It fell 8% below the 266.04 entry, ushering in the [golden rule of selling](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


The next base? A beauty.


Even though it had the look of a [double bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), the left side seemed to offer a pair of lows. That was weird. But you could argue the 15.6% correction from head to toe was shallow enough to call it a 13-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). In the week ended July 23, Apple reversed higher and volume surged higher than in any other week in the base **(4)**. That's volume. Call it institutional accumulation.


Apple also showed four up weeks in a row, another plus. That culminated in a sound breakout in heavy and rising weekly volume **(5)**.Â Apple rallied more than 30% by February 2011 to a peak of 364.90, then formed a set of new bases before powering higher.

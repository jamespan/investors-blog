In the first half of 2007, **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) created an unusual cup-type base.

  

Then again, Baidu was an unusual stock. How so?

  

Baidu's growth rate was off the charts. When the stock eventually broke out, profit quadrupled in 2006 and was on pace to more than double by the end of 2007. Revenue soared 190% in 2004 (to \$14 million), 176% in 2005 (\$39 million) and 171% in 2006 (\$106 million).

  

Remember, it's not the size of the top line or the bottom line that counts. It's the size of the growth.

  

And few stocks can grow as fast as Baidu did in 2007.

  

Baidu's second unusual factor was in its chart action right before its big move on May 14, 2007. That breakout led to a 223% advance from a 132.90 buy point to a high of 429.19 nearly six months later.

  

In the May 9 column, part of a recently ended 10-part series titled "How To Spot A Fine Chart," we discussed the importance of symmetry within a cup base or a double-bottom pattern.

  

In some cases, a great base may not seem to meet this requirement.

  

Take Baidu. After a multiyear high of 134.10 in January 2007, Baidu began to correct in price. It took 11 weeks to etch the left side of a base **1**.

  

In a symmetrical cup pattern, it would have taken another 11 weeks, give or take a few, to finish the pattern. But in the week ended April 27, Baidu soared 25% for the week on a strong quarterly report and nearly notched a new high on the Friday of that week **2**. Just 11 sessions later, Baidu coasted past the 134.20 entry in heavy volume to start its big run **3**.

  

So from the April 2 low of 92.80, the stock built the right side in just seven weeks, much less time than on the left side.

  

However, several other positives outweighed this imperfection. Notice how the handle began with a two-day shakeout **4** and volume quieted down soon afterward.

  

On March 14, the stock made a positive reversal near the bottom **5**, then tested that low about three weeks later. That occurred in the middle of the base, adding an element of symmetry to the overall pattern after all.

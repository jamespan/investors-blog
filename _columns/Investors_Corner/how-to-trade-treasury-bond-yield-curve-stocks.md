The yield curve is gaining attention these days. When the two-year Treasury bond yield creeps above the 10-year yield — which it's threatening to do — market watchers say a recession follows.




On Tuesday, the yield curve showed flatness in the midyear range, and wire services reported a slight inversion of 2 basis points between the benchmark 2-year and 5-year notes. That is, the 2-year bond at one point showed a yield of 2.82% vs. 2.80% for the 5-year note.


Meanwhile, Bloomberg data showed that the spread between the benchmark 2-year and 10-year bonds got squeezed to 52 basis points. On Jan. 1 this year, the spread was 102 basis points, or more than a full percentage point.


So, should an investor start selling stocks if the yield curve inverts?


Bond Yield Curve And What IBD Has Discovered
--------------------------------------------


IBD research on the yield curve found two surprises.


Since 1978, an interest-rate inversion has occurred 20 times, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data on the St. Louis Fed's website. Was the inversion useful in predicting a recession?



**The first surprise:** The yield inversion often signals a recession, but the prediction isn't all that useful. The recession sometimes came a year or even two years after the inversion. An indicator that takes two years to work out isn't much of an indicator.


A better way to handle the yield-inversion question is to forget the recession talk. Focus on the stock market itself and the [trend it's giving](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). How did the stock market react after the inversion? Did it fall, rise or move sideways? Would an investor have been best off selling or buying shares on the first day of the inversion?


**The second surprise:** Of the 20 inversions, seven times an investor would've been best off selling, but eight times an investor would've been best off buying. In the remaining five instances, the optimal action was unclear because of choppiness or minor moves.


Let's take a look at the details. (IBD used the S&P 500 data through 1982 and the Nasdaq composite data after 1982 — roughly around the time the Nasdaq started to become the favored index.)


20 Historical Cases
-------------------


* Aug. 18, 1978: After the inversion, the S&P 500 rose about 3% in three weeks and then corrected 15% in eight weeks. Hindsight: Sell on the inversion.
* Sept. 12, 1980: The S&P 500 advanced 13%  in the 11 weeks after the inversion. Hindsight: Buy on the inversion.
* Dec. 28, 1981: After the inversion (which lasted only one day), the S&P 500 headed south, falling 17% in seven to eight months. Hindsight: Sell on inversion.
* Jan. 14, 1982: The S&P 500 lost 12% in the seven months after the inversion. Hindsight: Sell on inversion.
* June 2, 1982: Post-inversion, the S&P 500 lost 9% in two months. Hindsight: Sell on inversion.
* Dec. 13, 1988: After the inversion, the Nasdaq advanced 30% in 10 months. Hindsight: Buy.
* Aug. 11, 1989: The Nasdaq advanced 5% in the two months after the inversion. Hindsight: Hard to play either up or down.
* Nov. 3, 1989: Post-inversion, the Nasdaq dropped 9% in about three months. Hindsight: Sell on inversion.
* March 8, 1990: After the inversion, the Nasdaq dropped 4% and then rebounded to about 7% above the inversion-day close. Hindsight: Hard to play up or down.
* May 26, 1998: The Nasdaq rose 14% in the two months after the inversion. Hindsight: Buy.
* June 9, 1998: Post-inversion, the Nasdaq rose 12% in 1-1/2 months. Hindsight: Buy.
* July 21, 1998: The Nasdaq fell 31% in the 2-1/2 months after the inversion. Hindsight: Sell.
* Feb. 2, 2000: After the inversion, the Nasdaq rose 26% in a little more than one month. Hindsight: Buy.
* Dec. 27, 2005: Post-inversion, the Nasdaq fell less than 2%, then rose less than 5% above the inversion-day close. Hindsight: Hard to play.



Six Cases Since 2006
--------------------


* Jan. 31, 2006: After the inversion, the Nasdaq fell 3% in about two weeks and then rose 3% above the inversion level in about three months. Hindsight: Hard to play.
* March 21, 2006: The Nasdaq rose almost 4% in the four weeks after the inversion and then slid 12% under the inversion day in four months. Hindsight: Sell.
* June 8, 2006: Post-inversion, the Nasdaq fell almost 4% in less than a week, then rose 2% above the inversion-day close in about three weeks, and then 6% below the inversion close. Hindsight: Hard to play.
* Aug. 2, 2006: After the inversion, the Nasdaq eased 1% in less than two weeks and then rebounded to 18% above the inversion-day close in 3-1/2 months. Hindsight: Buy.
* Aug. 14, 2006: Post-inversion, the Nasdaq rose 19% in about three months. Hindsight: Buy.
* May 3, 2007: The Nasdaq rose 6% in the 2-1/2 months after the inversion. Hindsight: Buy.


For IBD-style investors, the data suggest that an investor shouldn't sell blindly on a yield curve inversion. The market is just as likely to go up as down. That means investors should shape their actions around the action of the market. In other words, follow the usual IBD rules on buying and selling.

Investors looking to get a jump-start on a stock ahead of a flat-base breakout just might be in luck.


But first, let's review the basic traits of a flat base. These shallow patterns often start forming as a stock takes a breather after an earlier advance. So they're more likely to occur as a second-stage or later base — following a breakout from a cup with handle, saucer with handle or double bottom — during a stock's major uptrend.


Flat bases can be shorter than most other patterns, but they must take shape over a minimum of five weeks, usually beginning with the first down week.


They tend to move mostly sideways in a fairly tight range. The correction within a flat base should be no more than 15% from its intraday high to the bottom of the pattern. Any deeper and it's more likely to be a cup-shaped base. That's still deep enough to form a slight "U" shape, but calculating the depth will help you figure out if it's a flat or cup pattern.


To get the proper buy point, add 10 cents to the highest price in the pattern, which is usually the start of the base. But a stock may sometimes form a resistance area slightly below the prior high, setting up a potential early buy point.


**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), the premier Chinese search engine, built a series of bases during its big run from early 2009 to 2011. Let's focus on the flat base that kicked off with an intraday high on July 27, 2009.


The stock traded in a fairly narrow range for the first three weeks, then fell a bit deeper to its 50-day moving average, where it found support **(1)** by big investors such as hedge funds, banks and insurers. After climbing back to its narrow range, it headed south again until it met the 50-day line.


This time, when Baidu rebounded off the support level, it continued past the earlier resistance level and the left-side high to break out from a nearly seven-week flat base.


The traditional buy point stood at 368.59, or 10 cents past the left peak. But investors seeking an earlier entry could have bought at 353.10, a dime above the first point of resistance in the base.


Still another early entry for the more aggressive investor presented itself near 345. Sometimes you can draw a trend line connecting at least three points along the top of the base and find the lowest potential entry. In either case, Baidu cleared both early buy points on Sept. 8 as it surged 4% in above-average trade. From there, shares rallied more than 350% to a late July 2011 high.

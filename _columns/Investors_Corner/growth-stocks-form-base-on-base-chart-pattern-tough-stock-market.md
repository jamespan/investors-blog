  For Really Big Moves In Tough Markets, Two Bases Are Sometimes Better Than One

When it comes to [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), sometimes two is better than one. That's why the base-on-base pattern, which links two distinct and [sound bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), often leads to big winners.




The [base on base](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) happens after a company's stock forms a [normal base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) and breaks out above a [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Under ideal conditions, such a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) would lead to a 20% gain or more before the big move faltered or corrected.


But sometimes, the overall stock market itself is not accommodating. After all, most of a stock's movement is determined by the general market. Such has been the case in recent months when, despite some strong moves and big earnings surprises, many breakouts have sputtered. Instead, before rising 20% or more, they re-base and reset.


It's not hard to see why. Markets rarely go straight up, but often come under intense selling pressure at times — even when making overall advances. In those times, it's hard for a stock to just take off. Sometimes even the best stocks come under intense selling pressure.

In recent days, weeks and months, we've seen this aplenty. We've had a gigantic trade and political dispute with China that has hung over each trading session like a dark cloud. Meanwhile, the threat of a presidential impeachment, the topsy-turvy geopolitics of the Mideast, debate over Fed policy, and the seemingly endless EU Brexit debate have all at one time or another spooked investors. The market's ups and downs reflect all this.



That's why it's wise each day to consult IBD's [Market Trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) prognosis, which tells you what the market is doing.


Just to be clear, a base-on-base pattern is not the same as two bases side by side. There must be a breakout from the first base, followed by the formation of a new base slightly higher. The low of that new base should not go too deeply into the first base, and certainly not to its bottom.


How To Spot The Base On Base
----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ICnow100719-300x161.jpg)A good recent example is cloud-based software provider **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)). Back in late October of 2016, it began forming what would become a 12-week [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) **(1)**. It set up under an 89.89 [breakout price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). On Jan. 26, 2017, the stock [gapped up](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) 3.6%, just one day after it rose 2.9%. Both gains came on accelerating and higher-than-average volume and pushed ServiceNow over the buy point.


In the following three weeks, the stock ran up more than 5%, from the breakout price of 89.89 to a near-term top of 94.72. That was well short of a 20% gain.


But the stock didn't just roll over and drop below its previous level. No, it began to form a second base, this also a nine-week cup **(2)** with a 94.82 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Just as before, ServiceNow stock again broke out in April 2017. It gapped up 7.4%, but this time moved smartly into the buy zone. From there, with two brief corrections in December 2017 and again in February of 2018, ServiceNow stock ran up 86% to 176.56 by mid-March 2018.


Quite a run for a base-on-base formation. But it's not all that unusual. ServiceNow is no outlier.


A large number of stocks either recently set up or are currently forming favorable base-on-base patterns, including **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)), **Federal Signal** ([FSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSS)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)).


So let's take a look at one of those: Edwards Lifesciences, just added to the [Leaderboard stock List](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and already on the [IBD 50 list](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) of top growth stocks.



A look at IBD's [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-edwards-lifesciences-ew.aspx) shows it has a 99 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), meaning it is in the top 1% of all stocks on a number of technical and fundamental factors, including both price performance and earnings. And it's No. 1 in its industry group, so it's a real leader.


That's important, because a base on base works only for truly excellent stocks. Mediocre stocks need not apply.


The Base On Base And Leading Growth Stocks Today
------------------------------------------------


After running up a little over 11% from an earlier base, on Sept. 28, 2018, Edwards Lifesciences began a [consolidation pattern](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) that lasted roughly 19 weeks. On Feb. 12, it briefly broke out but stalled just above the consolidation. It then went sideways for five weeks before breaking out again, gapping up 6.2% on March 13. There, just above the consolidation pattern, it formed a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base — making a base-on-base formation.


Out of that base-on-base formation, on July 24 Edwards Lifesciences definitively gapped up. It added 9.9% in one day. Now, despite all the recent market turmoil, it's extended above the cup with handle's 195.10 buy point, and 27% above its level when it emerged from the consolidation back in February.


That's a nice move. And it might not be over, based on recent action. Edwards Lifesciences stock held up well during the early October sell-off, jumping 3.6% during the Oct. 3 rally on an 81% surge in volume, a bullish sign.

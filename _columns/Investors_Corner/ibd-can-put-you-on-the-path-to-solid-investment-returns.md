The [CAN SLIM investing system](http://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/?termID=757&term=CAN+SLIM%26reg%3b&mode=searchResults) is designed to maximize returns and minimize losses.


From January 1998 to December 2009, CAN SLIM generated total returns of 2,763%, according to an independent study conducted in real time by the American Association of Individual Investors. That gain came despite a rough ride for the overall market: The S&P 500 rose 14.9% over the same 12-year period.


Mastering the system takes time, but here are some tips to learning it as quickly as possible.


• **[Go to IBD University.](http://education.investors.com/)**


Click on the tab on the Investors.com home page. It gives step-by-step lessons on how to analyze a stock's fundamental and technical characteristics. [Daily Stock Analysis](http://education.investors.com/daily-stock-analysis) and the Investor's Corner archive also help you hone your skills.


• **Learn to time the market.**


The key rule is to buy strong leading stocks only when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. Use the Market Pulse box that accompanies [The Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm). This daily column explains the day's action, identifies key market trends and discusses the action of market leaders.


• **Invest in yourself.**


Once you've decided that you want to master the system, it's a good idea to attend workshops hosted by expert instructors. These workshops, ranging from Level 1 to the Model Stock Summit, will build and reinforce your knowledge.


Links to the [workshops](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing/?nav=secondIBDUWorkshops) can be found at IBD University. They're a good place to meet other CAN SLIM investors and learn from their experiences. So are [IBD Meetup groups](https://www.investors.com/meetup/?nav=IBDUMeetup), which are held in most states and overseas. For those unable to attend, the [Naperville, Ill., Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/chicagoibd/) holds a regular webcast (go to IBD University and click on Meetups).


• **Keep an open mind.**


Some aspects of the system appear counterintuitive. Some rules even contradict commonly accepted principles. For example, many investment advisers will tell you to shun stocks with high price-to-earnings ratios.


But IBD has found that P-E ratios shouldn't even factor into the buy decision. History shows that many of the market's biggest winners had high P-E ratios when they began their runs, not when they peaked.


• **Learn to sell like a pro.**


Stocks with CAN SLIM credentials can soar over a relatively short period of time. But they also fall quickly once they peak. You can read and review two recent series of Corner articles (dated [May 21 to June 4](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/611488/201205211612/how-to-sell-winners-like-a-pro.aspx) and from [Aug. 23 to Sept. 6](http://news.investors.com/special-report/623411-sell-like-a-pro-ii-defense.aspx) in Investors.com) to master this crucial skill.

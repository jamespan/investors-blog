There are proper bases, and then there are bases that you shouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole.

Learning how to distinguish sound patterns from flawed ones can mean the difference between a profitable trade and one that hands you a loss.

A cup base is simple, right? As long as it looks like a teacup, you should be good to go.

Wrong. There are other characteristics to watch out for.

First, it takes a minimum of six weeks for a cup base to form. Anything less just isn't a cup. Make sure you look at a weekly chart for easy identification. Start counting on the first down week.

Proper cups tend to correct 20% to 30%, so watch out for ones that correct more. But in bear markets, cups can be as deep as 40% to 50%. Bear markets will ravage the chart patterns of nearly all stocks.

Avoid cups where price action is all over the place. Focus on ones with calm, tight and constructive price work.

Also watch out for wide-and-loose bars â€” those where the weekly price range is much larger than other price bars in the base. That kind of action tends to show the stock getting knocked around by big sellers.

Look for cup bases that are U-shaped rather than V-shaped. The former allows the stock to go through a natural correction to wear out the weak holders. V-shaped cups don't allow for this kind of correction.

As with any base, you want to see evidence of accumulation. The evidence can be weekly price gains in above-average trade, with strong closes. Beware of bases with many down weeks in above-average trade.

Also take into account what stage of the move the stock is in. Look for first- and second-stage patterns. Late-stage cups can work, but they are more risky.

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) shaped a flawed cup base in the summer of 2011. The base was six weeks long, fitting the minimum time requirement. Amazon's cup corrected 22%, or within the normal range.

On the downside, the base had two big down weeks in above-average trade **(1)**. The spreads in the weeks ended Aug. 5 and Aug. 19 **(2)** were also much larger than those in prior patterns.

The stock broke out in the week ended Sept. 16, clearing a 227.55 buy point. Amazon.com rose 8% before losing steam. It triggered the 8% sell rule at 209.35 in the week ended Oct. 7 **(3)**, and rocky action continued for weeks.

Looking for stocks to buy but don't know where to start? Check out IBD's Stock Spotlight feature.

The Spotlight, today on page B5, aims to identify emerging leaders while they're still in bases or just breaking out above buy points. It's a good place to build a watch list of stocks showing potential to lead the market.

The 16 stocks in the screen — eight from the NYSE and eight from the Nasdaq — often boast strong earnings and sales growth, and are outperforming the broad market. They can be big-cap stocks or small cap, old names or recently listed.

IBD research has shown that a stock's potential to rise 20%, 50% or more in short order is greatest when it breaks out of a properly formed base, such as a cup with handle, in volume that's more than 40% above average.

The weekly mini charts help you understand each stock's fundamental and technical characteristics, identify bases and spot buy points. Each chart shows Earnings Per Share, Relative Price Strength and Composite ratings as well as recent profit growth and other relevant data.

The column that accompanies the charts contains an analysis of one or more of the most promising stocks in the screen or focuses on a theme that ties together several stocks.

Russian Internet search leader **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)) appeared in the Spotlight screen on May 7, 2013. The stock was still in buying range after clearing a 25.40 cup-without-handle buy point. At the breakout, Yandex's mini chart showed that its group, Internet-Content, was ranked No. 6 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.

The stock had a best-possible 99 Composite Rating and an EPS Rating of 98. An A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating hinted that big funds were buying.

Yandex rose 16% to a new high of 29.48 on May 20 before pulling back to form a cup-with-handle base with a 28.74 buy point, which it cleared in heavy volume on July 10. The stock formed another cup with handle en route to a high of 45.42 on Jan. 9 of this year, bringing the total gain from the May 2013 breakout to 79%.

IBD recently enlarged the Spotlight mini charts and added a brief description of the stock's action at the bottom of each chart.

Performance data is updated daily at the top of the page. As of Monday's IBD, Nasdaq and NYSE Spotlight stocks were up 22.1% and 18.4% over the past 12 months, respectively. Both have outperformed the S&P 500's 17.9% gain.

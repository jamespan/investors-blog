If anyone at Walt Disney had a bad feeling about its 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm, this past weekend's record-breaking box office figures probably laser-blasted those concerns into a galaxy far, far away.

  

"Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens" reportedly raked in \$248 million in the U.S. and Canada on opening weekend, bumping previous record holder "Jurassic World" down to the No. 2 spot on the charts.

  

Globally, the seventh installment of the sci-fi cinematic franchise made \$529 million, also rendering the dinosaurs' worldwide record of \$524.9 million extinct — a hefty feat, considering the new "Star Wars" flick doesn't even premiere in China until Jan. 9.

  

**Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) is trading at a two-month low but may be working on a fresh base. The stock is 13% below an all-time peak of 122.08.

  

**Imax** ([IMAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IMAX)) also boasted big box office sales for "Force Awakens." But Imax shares fell 4% in heavy trading and undercut the 200-day moving average, a key long-term support line.

  

Han Solo and company premiered to overwhelmingly positive (and mostly spoiler-free) reviews, earning a 95% on the critic aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.

  

**Popular Among Women**

  

In a departure from previous iterations, "Force Awakens" prominently features a strong female lightsaber-wielding lead, Rey (played by British newcomer Daisy Ridley), in addition to Leia Organa (played by Carrie Fisher).

  

Men made up 63% of the audience on Friday, notes Stifel analyst Benjamin Mogil, but over the weekend the gender imbalance lessened to a 58-42 split. "With strong reviews and a strong female lead, 42% of the Saturday/Sunday audience was female (a high figure for the genre)," he wrote, "and we view this expansion of the marketplace as likely granting the film a higher multiplier."

  

Mogil raised his estimates on Disney, citing the film's stronger-than-expected opening weekend numbers. He noted that it did not break global box office records, with China pending.

  

"The Force Awakens" opens there on Jan. 9.

  

Disney's \$4 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm is likely looking like a good deal in light of the film's performance. Wall Street analysts predict that this movie alone will bring in \$1.5 billion to \$2 billion worldwide, and Macquarie had projected that "Star Wars" merchandise sales could produce \$5 billion in revenue in the first year.

  

"The Force Awakens" is not Disney's only hope. The next two episodes of the sequel trilogy are scheduled for 2017 and 2019.

  

Disney belongs to the Media-Diversified industry group, ranked 98th as of Monday among 197 IBD industry groups and subgroups in terms of six-month relative price performance. Just **Gray Television** ([GTN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GTN)) beats Disney in terms of [IBD Composite Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-walt-disney-company-dis.aspx) at 91 vs. 89. Gray also earns a 91 RS rating.

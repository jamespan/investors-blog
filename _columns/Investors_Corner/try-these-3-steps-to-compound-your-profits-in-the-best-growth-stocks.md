Investors can fortify an overall return from bonds by reinvesting the interest payments in fresh debt. They can do the same in an excellent mutual fund or one of the [best ETFs](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/best-etfs-exchange-traded-funds/). But can you generate a compounding return in individual growth stocks? Absolutely. Here's how.




First, follow all the rules of the [CAN SLIM seven-point program](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) for picking growth stocks. Time your [initial buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) only when the stock market is in a [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). Then grab shares just as a fast-growing company rallies out of a [well-formed base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), such as the [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/), [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) or [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


If you've chosen well, you might get a chance to [exit the stock with a 20% to 25% profit](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) or more in a relatively short period of time.


But what if you have conviction that such a dynamic stock may have the chops to grow really big? Then look for spots in which to add a minor amount of shares. If the stock behaves right, you'll make money in your original position and in your add-on. Your wealth may compound.


Compounding A Return In The Best Growth Stocks
----------------------------------------------


Three choice spots to add shares:


**Spot No. 1**: Wait for a smooth, gentle pullback to or near its 10-week moving average. The red line on an [IBD weekly chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=weekly) plots a continuous average of weekly closing prices over the past 10 weeks. Does the line rise in slope? If so, it reflects the stock's superb strength. When a stock rebounds off the 10-week line, or crosses back above it in heavy volume, you're getting a nifty signal that banks, insurers and mutual funds are shoring up support for the stock.


So, how much to add? Consider 20% or 25% of the money you used to buy an initial position. Don't buy the same amount of shares or more. You'll get too "top-heavy." Your average cost will go up too quickly. So, if you purchased \$50,000 worth of a stock at the [true breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), consider adding \$12,000 to \$12,500 worth of additional shares.


**Spot No. 2**: Use the weekly chart to discover a [3-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) or a [short-stroke pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/). When they clear a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), add a small amount of shares, perhaps one-eighth or a tenth of your initial stake.


**Spot No. 3:** When you've got a huge paper gain, you can hold steadfast as shares work through the process of creating a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). If it breaks out again, add some more shares. You could even build a new full position. But make sure the market, the industry group and leading stocks are acting well.


Top Growth Stocks And When To Buy More: The Regeneron Case Study
----------------------------------------------------------------


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wICregn_031819-300x169.jpg)Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) delivered after it broke out of a [double bottom with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) at 320.18 in the week ended Aug. 1, 2014 **(1)**. In September and October, the biotech made two tests of the 10-week moving average **(2)** near 336 and 352. One of those tests got volatile.


Yet Regeneron kept rising.


More follow-on buy points emerged, including the breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) at 437.74. Regeneron eventually topped out at 605 in August 2015 **(3)**, up 89% from the [original breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


The innovator in treating macular degeneration had shown strong profit and sales growth for numerous quarters before the initial breakout.


In 2013 alone, earnings jumped 75% to \$8.17 a share on a 53% spike in revenue.



The run by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) from its Jan. 6, 2017, [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) provided quite a smooth ride up and multiple chances to bolster the total return with new buys.


Ditto for **Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) and **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) in 2016 and 2017, and **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) from its May 2017 breakout.

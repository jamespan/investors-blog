Leaderboards aren't all that exciting at golf tournaments. They show you who's ahead and by how many strokes.


There's another leaderboard at Investors.com that's much more exciting. Interested in finding out which growth names are near buy points or within buying range? How about some occasional short-selling ideas?


[IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), a premium service available only via IBD's website, is unique in that it's not a computer-generated stock screen like Sector Leaders and the IBD 50. Treat the Leaders List as a portfolio of top-performing growth stocks. There's a human element to it because stocks are hand-selected by the IBD markets team after extensive discussion and research.


Leaderboard has two main sections: Leaders and the Cut List. Every stock comes with analysis of daily and weekly price and volume trends as well as fundamental analysis that details what's driving the stock's performance.


The Leaders List is a portfolio of growth stocks with strong fundamentals and technicals. The Cut List is home to stocks that are short-sale candidates or recently departed the Leaders List due to poor price action.


Stocks are added to the Leaders List when they're at or near buy points. Daily and weekly charts are marked up, highlighting buy points, areas where it's possible to add shares, and other key technical action. Buy points are annotated in blue, and sell signals are shown in red.


Leaderboard users also benefit from an IBD 50 that's updated on a daily basis. Fundamental and technical analysis of the top 10-ranked stocks is also provided each day. Other IBD stock screens accessible via Leaderboard include Sector Leaders and Stock Spotlight. You can do all your research in one place.


Market conditions dictate how many stocks are on the Leaders List. In a strong market uptrend, the list can hold as many as 20 or more names. But when distribution starts to come into the major averages heavily, it tends to get shorter.


Through Thursday, IBD Leaderboard was up 54.8% compared to a 25.9% gain for the S&P 500.


**Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) joined the Leaders on June 25, just before it cleared a rare high, tight flag pattern. The stock rallied 78% past a 107.23 early entry over the next 13 weeks. It was sent to the Cut List on Sept. 7 when it broke below its 10-week moving average in huge volume.

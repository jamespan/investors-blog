If you [sell stocks short,](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shorting-a-stock-short-selling/) perhaps the biggest thing you fear is the stock gapping up in price. Way up.


A gain of 10%, 15% or more would be reason enough to force a short seller to buy back shares and lick the wounds. Yet if you can avoid making common mistakes, you can greatly reduce the chance that a gap up will happen.




A trader can still lose money if the stock doesn't gap up. A stock can rise for many days or weeks in a row, forcing a short seller to cut losses and move on.


So whether you are new to short selling or have deep experience, you'll want to avoid these costly errors.


The Dangers Of Short Selling: Picking The Top
---------------------------------------------


It's extremely foolish to try to sell into strength. One simply cannot know when a hot stock will suddenly turn cold. You may know that certain stocks tend to fall back after reaching round numbers. Once they hit 60 for example, they backtrack. The same action occurs at 80 or 100. But the pullback may be temporary.


Instead of trying to guess, observe. Wait for a stock to show signs of topping. It may hit a series of new highs in low volume, then drop like a rock in heavy turnover. Or a stock may fumble its breakout from a [fourth-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) and trigger the [7% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


When such changes in a stock's behavior take place, that's the time to look for patterns of weakness to emerge. The [failed late-stage base breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/what-steps-to-take-in-mastering-the-art-of-short-selling-stocks/) and the [head-and-shoulders pattern](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/learn-to-recognize-head-and-shoulders-pattern/) allow you to time your short sale for a solid profit and with less risk. Why? You are in effect joining the fray when the sellers have the upper hand in the stock, not the buyers.


Remember, your goal as an individual is to go along for the ride, not to determine it. Leave the destiny of the stock in the hands of banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, insurance firms, pension managers and the like.

NVR Stock: Bad Short Trade In 2017
----------------------------------


Take **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), the builder of luxury homes. Suppose you had sold shares short as the stock's July 2016 breakout from a cup with handle broke down **(1)**.


Technically, it was a good sell; NVR had lumbered up more than 227% from its September 2011 low of 555. Volume in the breakout week shrank well below average.


The stock eventually fell to as low as 1,478. If you had shorted NVR around 1,691, when the stock fell 7% from the flat-base entry, the maximum potential gain was 14%.


What if you tried to short again in late January of 2017**(2)** as the builder reclaimed 52-week highs? Disaster.


**Another Risk: Selling Short When It's Too Obvious**
-----------------------------------------------------


Have you tried to short only after shares have already fallen 5% or 10% for the week or more? Everyone sees that drop too. If you short as a stock is making new lows, you may fall into the trap in which market specialists and big funds see the sell-off as a good time to bargain-hunt.


Veteran traders know that when a security has fallen sharply in price, causing losses among new buyers, the security is often ready to make a big bounce that will hurt the new shorts.


"The tendency to do better after a defeat — often observed in athletics — is a phenomenon that manifests itself in market action as well," global macro trader Victor Niederhoffer wrote in "The Education of a Speculator." "*After a loss, victory becomes more likely*. All good athletes know this maxim."


**Three More Common Mistakes**
------------------------------


* The head and shoulders takes roughly five to seven months to form. Don't wait for the stock to decline for years before finally diving in. And if a stock peaked at 100 and has fallen to the teens, chances are higher that value investors will come in and bid up the stock.
* Always check the average daily volume. Preferably, it should exceed 700,000 shares or more. What if you shorted a stock that trades much fewer than that? Market makers can exercise more influence on the price, bidding the stock up sharply enough to force you to cover and mop up your losses.
* After you execute well on the short sale, execute well on the closing of the trade. Take profits when they hit 20% to 25%. Most market corrections are temporary. Rarely will you get a period like March 2000 to October 2002, a terrible bear market for the techs, and the subprime debt-inspired Wall Street crisis from November 2007 to March 2009.

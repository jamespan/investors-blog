Late-stage bases are a meaningful concept for investors who wish to maximize their gains and minimize their losses in big winners such as **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)). How so?




A base is sort of like a mattress. The new, high-quality ones have good bounce and spring. An old mattress tends to lose the strength and support you need for a good night's rest.


Late-stage bases like that old mattress. You don't want to be lying on it when it finally gives in.


Learn [how to count bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) correctly, and it will help you avoid big losses in what was once a hot-performing stock.

A late-stage base could be the third, fourth or even fifth base that appears on the chart. At that point, your stock's uptrend may be getting old. And even good stocks can peter out and go into a deep correction after finishing just two bases.


Which stocks can make a fourth- or fifth-stage base? Perhaps only a handful during a bull market. They are almost always the very best in terms of profit and sales growth, expanding institutional sponsorship, and the quality of their products or services. You can sometimes tell just by scanning their [IBD ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) and the strength of the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) evaluation.



Don't get complacent. After all the hard work you've done, sifting for the stock and tracking its price for the moment it breaks out, what a shame it would be to miss this one flaw.


A Bear Market Does This To Top Stocks
-------------------------------------


Most often the case, most stocks reset their base counts by the end of a nasty bear market, such as the ones in 1990, 1998, 2000-2002 and 2008-2009. At that point, as the new bull emerges, all base counts reset to zero. Everything is fresh and new.


There isn't that much difficulty in counting bases. How do you do it?


When a stock has broken out, look for a minimum 20% rally from the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) before looking for a second base to emerge. A [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) counts as a single base, because the upper base forms before a stock has advanced 20%.


IBD research has discovered a second way that a stock can reset its base count in the midst of a long-term market uptrend. Watch for failed breakouts. If the stock declines far enough to undercut the most recent base's lowest price, reset the base count to zero.


A Huge Medical Stock Run
------------------------


Consider a longtime market favorite, **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ICisrg040617.png)Count the bases: A [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) appeared in February-July 2004 **(1)** (the accompanying chart is a monthly; please go to [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF2) via the link on the home page of Investors.com to view a historical weekly chart); a cup with handle in April-July 2005 **(2)**; a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) in August-October 2005 **(3),** best seen on a weekly chart; and a vast cup with handle from February 2006 through March 2007 **(4)**.


That last pattern, the most dramatic, can't be said to have been a failure. The stock tripled from its 118.07 buy point.


Now look at the action from December 2007 through April 2008. The robots-in-the-operating-room pioneer formed a [five-month cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) **(5)**.


Intuitive broke out in April, reversed lower **(6)** and ultimately fell apart. The huge decline reset the base count.


Intuitive has emerged as a new leader in yet another long bull market. That's rare. But don't ignore the truly great companies that somehow continue to find ways to keep growing and stay at the top of their respective industries.


From July to September 2016, Intuitive [created a shallow flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), then cleared the 240.03 buy point (adjusted for stock splits) during a three-week rally in heavy volume. The rally lacked oomph. Intuitive then undercut the base's low of 223.50.


Back To Stage One
-----------------


The base count went back to zero. Yet Intuitive fought its way back up. And Intuitive's breakouts continue to be winners. They include a move out of a four-month [early-stage saucer base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/) at 242.49 in the week ended Feb. 24, 2017.


Through the week ended Aug. 17, 2018, shares gained 116%, vs. a 20% gain by the S&P 500.

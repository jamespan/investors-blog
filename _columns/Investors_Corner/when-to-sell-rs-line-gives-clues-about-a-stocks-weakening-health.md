A stock gives clues about its underlying health all the time, but the clues aren't available using just fundamental analysis. Many successful investors use good stock charts to make timely buy and sell decisions. And [learning how to use the relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) can help investors gain an edge on Wall Street.

Price-and-volume trends can tell you if a stock is poised to head higher or lower. Another indicator, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), is hard to find in most charting services, but it's front and center in [IBD charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) because of its importance.

The [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/), drawn in blue on every [IBD daily stock chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily) and weekly chart at Investors.com, compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500. (IBD charts are accessed through the Research section on the home page of Investors.com.)

If the line slopes higher, it means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500, a market benchmark; when it's moving sideways, it's more or less in line with the S&P 500 and when it's sloping downward, it's underperforming.

## Use The Relative Strength Line For Selling

When a stock breaks out, the RS line should be poised to shoot into new high ground or at least be rising sharply. If the line is in new high ground ahead of its breakout — a rare sight — even better.

![IC_swi_101716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IC_swi_101716-1024x550.png)This was not the case with **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) when the business software play tried to clear a [cup with handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in January of 2013 **(1)**. Its RS line was lagging badly.

In March, the stock attempted a second breakout. Its RS line was in better shape, but it still wasn't showing uncanny strength. As a result, the breakout stalled in a matter of days.

## A Second Critical Flaw

Another factor working against SolarWinds: It was trying to break out from a late-stage base after a huge run already.

Don't confuse a stock's RS line with IBD's [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/). They're completely different. On a scale of 1 to 99 with the 99 being the best, the RS Rating measures a stock's price performance against all other stocks in the IBD database. A rating of 99 means the stock has outperformed 99% of all stocks based on 12-month price performance.

## Check This Rating Before And After The Breakout

At its second breakout attempt in March 2013, SolarWinds' RS Rating was a mediocre 73 **(2)**. Keep in mind that based on an IBD study of the top stock market winners from the early 1950s through 2008, the average RS Rating of the best-performing stocks _before_ their big price moves began was 87.

After hitting a high of 61.52 on March 14, SolarWinds quickly lost as much as 30% of its value. Shares crashed 15% on May 1; the company reported solid earnings growth, but notched its third straight quarter of decelerating sales growth and gave a dour sales outlook. Yet the stock's RS line had already been trending lower.

_A version of this column was first published in the May 13, 2013, edition of IBD. SolarWinds was taken private by affiliates of Silver Lake Partners and Thoma Bravo in February 2016. It then returned to the NYSE in October 2018. Follow Shreve on Twitter: [@IBD_KShreve](https://twitter.com/IBD_KShreve)._

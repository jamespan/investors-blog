Yes, there are stocks that will double or triple in price every year. But expecting those kinds of results in every single trade is just unrealistic.


Instead of wishing for a moon shot every time, investors need a sounder approach to taking profits in the market.


In most cases, profits should be booked once a stock rises 20% to 25% past a proper base buy point. This is strictly a money management technique. It doesn't depend on what the stock is doing technically at that time.


There is no way to know if a stock will go up 20% to 25% after a breakout. But if it does, following this sell rule accomplishes several objectives.


First, just because you bought a leading stock that broke out of a picture-perfect base in big volume doesn't guarantee that it's going to be a huge winner.


In reality, investors will have a number of small losses and be rewarded with a large winner less frequently.


But selling once you have a profit of 20% to 25%, you lock in a solid gain. Remember that you only have a paper profit until you hit the sell button. Three or four of these gains can make for a happy year.


And by selling once you have a 20%-to-25% gain, you can still come out in the black if you have two stocks that fall 8%, followed by one winner.


Second, some leading stocks will pull back and form new bases once they rise 20% to 25%. This rule will help you avoid sitting through frustrating corrections that can wipe out hard-earned gains.


Also, investors should often sell when the going is still good.


In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD Chairman William O'Neil wrote, "The object is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger."


In the week ended July 27 last year, IT management software maker **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) blew past a 47.99 buy point in a double-bottom base in huge turnover. Better-than-expected Q2 results provided the lift.


The stock rallied 27% to an all-time high of 60.95 in September before pulling back. There were plenty of chances to take gains. SolarWinds went on to correct 26% to 44.83, **1** wiping out gains from its July breakout.

*Tenth In A Series*

  

For most investors, losses pack more of a punch than gains.

  

It's a fact that's been well established by experts in behavioral finance, a field that uses psychology to explain investment decisions.

  

Some experts have even estimated that the pain of a loss is twice the pleasure of a gain.

  

This human quirk helps explain why investors do what's called "averaging down."

  

The term refers to the process of buying additional shares in a company at lower prices than you originally purchased. The process brings the average price you've paid for all your shares down, hence the expression "averaging down."

  

IBD has long argued that you shouldn't throw money at a stock that's declined since you bought it. You're generally better off selling the loser than "averaging down."

  

But it can be tough to get investors to follow this advice, especially given the typical investor's psychology.

  

By selling a loser, the investor is taking a loss. There's no way to hide from it — it's right there in the record of your transaction.

  

**Hope Vs. Truth**

  

If you don't bail out, on the other hand, you can still hope that you might end up with a profit — or at least break even. And you might even average down, if you're simply convinced that you've found a winner.

  

It all can feel better than actually booking a loss — that most painful of all investment outcomes. It's much more pleasant to have a stock only showing a paper loss. After all, it might still go up.

  

What can be done to get people to just cut their losses short rather than average down?

  

Well, one particular story has been effective over the years in getting investors to see the problem.

  

It's called " the turkey story." The tale apparently originated with Fred C. Kelly, author of "Why You Win or Lose," and it appears in "How to Make Money in Stocks," the book by IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil.

  

An old man has set up a box filled with corn to trap wild turkeys. The key step is for the man — waiting a hundred feet away — to pull a string that shuts the box, catching the turkeys.

  

One fine day, the corn inside the box has attracted a dozen of the animals. But then one turkey wanders out. The old man thinks: "Gosh, I wish I had pulled the string when all 12 were there." He adds: "I'll wait a minute and maybe the other one will go back."

  

While he's waiting for the 12th turkey to return, two more walk out on him. Then three more exit. He's down to six. As you might guess, he eventually gets down to one bird. Frustrated, he thinks: "I'll wait until he walks out or another goes in, and then I'll quit."

  

That lone turkey exits, leaving the man empty handed.

  

Investors often act like this old man. They think that the turkeys that have left will return. In other words, they often figure that a stock that's fallen is bound to rally.

  

Rather than pulling the trigger and taking what they've got — even though it represents a loss — they stay the course and get into bigger trouble. That frequently means throwing more money at that stock — i.e. averaging down. But that's generally a turkey of an idea.

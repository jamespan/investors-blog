One key element to a winning stock is the company's ability to earn profits that are not just juicy but steady. So you want to find companies with a long string of solid annual earnings gains.

  

In this, the second in a series examining the CAN SLIM formula for investing in great stocks, we'll look at A, as in big gains in annual earnings per share.

  

How much should annual EPS rise? At least 25%. But don't be afraid of superstars posting improvements that hit the triple digits. The higher the better.

  

Don't forget — we're talking about earnings per share, not net income. Make sure the company isn't flooding the market by selling extra shares for whatever reason. EPS tells you more about a company's operating prowess.

  

Also, look for at least three consecutive years of solid profit gains, with the average reaching at least 25%. Sales should also rise at a similar clip. This shows the company can weather travails in the broad economy.

  

A firm may be able to post a big EPS gain one year by sheer luck.

  

Maybe you're **Seagate Technologies** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)), and you produce hard drives. Your factories were relatively unscathed when Thailand (home to many disk factories) suffered its historic flooding last year. So disk prices soar, and you make out like a bandit.

  

But rivals will recover, output will resume, supply will rise. Prices will fall back to normal and so will your margins. A flood is simply not a winning plan.

  

Seagate's EPS show a big loss in 2009, a recovery in '10 followed by a 63% swoon (still a profit) in '11 — then a 444% explosion in fiscal 2012 (through June). Analysts look for just 7% growth in '13.

  

The market's best winners from 1980 to 2000 showed median annual earnings growth of 36% at the start of their move.

  

Three of four big winners also enjoyed at least some increase in earnings over three years, and in some cases five years, prior to their big bull runs.

  

Pay attention to a stock's Earnings Per Share Rating, listed daily in IBD's research tables. A 95 EPS Rating means that a stock's long-term and short-term growth is better than 95% of all companies in IBD's database.

Some investors seek out high-octane growth stocks with the potential for big, fast gains. Others prefer slower, steadier companies that offer dividends and can be held for the longer term.


The [Income Investor column](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/the-income-investor/) is almost tailor-made for the slow but steady crowd -- almost, because some fast-growth companies are also featured in the column from time to time.


Each day, Income Investor (in today's IBD on page B9) highlights one or more companies that not only pay steady dividends but also meet key fundamental and technical criteria. The accompanying Dividend, Utility and REIT Leaders screens next to the column in IBD offers plenty of ideas, while the six minicharts above the lists provide detail about those stocks.


Dividend Leaders, the broadest screen, shows names such as **AT&T** ([T](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=T)), **Merck** ([MRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRK)) and **Philip Morris** ([PM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PM)) making the screen lately, thanks to their steady earnings track record and dependable dividends. Other younger tech stocks recently on the list include **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **Microchip Technology** ([MCHP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHP)).


Utility Leaders are often considered as defensive plays. When the broader market is ailing and growth stocks are getting hit, utilities tend to hold up well. Income investors can also count on a steady dividend due to utilities' reliable revenue streams. That's why utilities have topped IBD's ranking of 197 industry groups during the recent market volatility.


REIT Leaders, the last screen, also offer a relative safe haven in a rocky market. Real estate investment trusts are set up in such a way that they can avoid paying corporate taxes if they pass the majority of their profits on to shareholders. They do so in the form of dividends, which is why many income investors also like REITs.


While a slow economy can hurt these businesses as well, REITs also have a fairly steady revenue stream since they collect rent payments and lease proceeds from buildings or other real assets they own and operate. Due to their tax structure, they pay out most of their profits in the form of cash dividends.


Keep in mind that even utility and REIT stocks can sink rapidly when the stock market goes into a deep decline. That's exactly what happened during the 2008-2009 bear decline. From July 2008 to March 2009, the Dow utility average fell 45%. So in severe situations, losses in every stock must be cut short and cash must be raised.


The three screens provide annualized dividend yields and long-term dividend growth rates for each company, in the last two columns of each list. From there, investors can decide which ones they would like to research further. Most of these stocks won't look like the typical high-growth companies that are setting up for a breakout, but it's usually better to be buying and holding them when the long-term trend is up.


AT&T has outperformed the market recently. The telecom giant has rallied 8% this year, after edging 2% higher in 2015. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were both slightly underwater last year and down 6% this year. AT&T, a S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, tops the Dividend Leaders list with a 5.24% yield, well above the S&P 500's average payout of 2.26%.

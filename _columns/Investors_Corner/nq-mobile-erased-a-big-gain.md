Bad things happen when investors put their egos ahead of sound trading decisions. Some investors, for instance, may keep pets in their portfolios. They are favored stocks that nevertheless continue to lag.


Others may refuse to cut losses when they're small (at 7% or less), figuring that the stock will bounce back.


Still others may buy stocks when they're not in a proper buy range or when the [market is in a correction](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm), on the belief that it's a sure winner.


Those who are new to IBD will benefit by following a time-tested set of proper buy and sell rules. The [IBD University module](http://education.investors.com/) , free for all visitors to Investors.com, is a great place to start to learn these rules.


Reading this column on a daily basis will also expose new investors to the basics on sound stock selection, chart reading and timing buys and sells â€” all the while staying free of ego and emotions that can be destructive to a stock portfolio.


In the summer of 2013, the market was in a confirmed uptrend. Chinese Internet stocks **YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) and **Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) were starting their big runs on the back of an improving Chinese economy.


With Internet usage rapidly expanding in China, it would have been understandable for investors to also latch onto Chinese computer security company **NQ Mobile** ([NQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NQ)). Sales rose at a triple-digit pace for 11 straight quarters through the period that ended in June 2013. Profit rose at a mostly high double-digit pace over that span.


So when NQ Mobile jumped 15% and cleared a cup base in heavy volume during the week that ended July 19, shareholders could be forgiven for being excited. The very next week, the stock rocketed 26% to its highest level since its May 2011 [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm). At that point, some shareholders no doubt felt that the stock was invincible.


Their conviction grew further as NQ continued to rise on the back of better-than-expected earnings reports. After rebounding off or near its 10-week moving average a couple of times **(1)**, NQ hit a peak of 25.90 in the week ended Oct. 25, a gain of 140% in just three months.


But the bottom fell out the very next week, as NQ Mobile crashed 57% and erased all of the profit **(2)**. What happened?


Muddy Waters Research, run by short seller Carson Block, accused NQ Mobile of deceiving investors about its cash on hand, claiming that the company was a "massive fraud." NQ Mobile denied the accusations, but the stock, despite a sharp rebound, rolled over and has yet to recover.


Of course, NQ's shareholders couldn't have seen the Muddy Waters accusations coming. But they would have done well to have kept a close eye on the stock.


A July 30, 2013, IBD story noted that NQ Mobile "does not have a whole lot of institutional sponsorship." One of the mistakes that investors can make is failing to buy high-quality companies with the backing of large mutual funds that tend to give a stock greater stability.


Stocks that lack institutional backing should be kept on a short leash. One way to do it is to take profits when a stock rises 20% to 25% above its buy point, since most stocks tend to correct at that point to form new bases.

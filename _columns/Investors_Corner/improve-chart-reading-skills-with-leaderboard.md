Chart reading is one of the most valuable skills you can learn to boost your chances of buying and selling stocks for a profit. Yet it takes time, patience and practice to properly interpret a stock's daily and weekly price-and-volume action.



IBD's articles and tools help hone those skills, both in print at Investors.com.


[IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup) provides fundamental and technical analysis, as well as access to a daily and weekly chart.


For those who want to get more serious about reading charts, IBD offers a premium online product called [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx). Launched in July 2011, the growth stocks comprising the Leaders List are handpicked by IBD's markets team.


These stocks meet CAN SLIM's investment model, including fundamentals such as earnings and sales growth, margins and fund ownership. Very few stocks pass all the stringent criteria to make the cut.


IBD's markets writers scrutinize the charts and add annotations in real time to help users make wise trading decisions.


To access the list, click on Leaderboard near the top of the Investors.com home page. The Leaders List is divided into two groups. The top group contains stocks that are trading near a proper buy point. The lower group is made up of stocks that may still be in base-building mode or are more than 5% extended past their buy points.


On the right side of each stock is a summary that's updated at least two times a day. It details the stock action, background on the company and recent news.


To the left of the summary is a daily stock chart. The chart may look simple, with the 10-day and 50-day moving averages and the relative strength line plotted on it.


But if you click to enlarge the chart, you'll find there's much more to it.


The bigger chart that pops up is marked with annotations: buy points, sell signals, earnings date and other helpful tips.


Blue annotations are used for buy points, red for sell signals.


Annotated charts are also available for the Top 10 stocks in the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/top10/default.aspx), as well as the Sector Leaders. The tabs can be found under the Leaderboard section.


Use Leaderboard to supplement your own research, or as a starting point for further due diligence. Just because a stock is added to the Leaders List doesn't mean it's an automatic buy. Also, buy shares only when IBD's current market outlook, noted on the Leaders page, shows a confirmed uptrend. When the uptrend is under pressure, exercise caution with new buys.


**Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), a current Leaderboard stock, joined the elite list on Jan. 9 as it gapped up past a 143.77 entry. IBD regulars likely know it's OK to buy on a gap, but as close to the opening price as possible.


For those who didn't know that buy technique, it was annotated on the chart (see above). Also marked are proper buy points, base patterns and the 20% profit target. When a stock goes past its entry, the maximum 5% buy zone is noted as well.


(Editor's note: The Leaderboard Summit will take place in Portland, Ore., on Saturday and in San Diego on Aug. 15. For more details, see "Today's Spotlight" at the Investors.com home page.)

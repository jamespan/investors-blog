You know how important it is to build a watch list. This ritual gets you ready to take action and buy good stocks correctly when the market is acting right.


But what if you cannot spend time on weekdays to refresh your watch list? What if you can afford only two or three hours every weekend?


That's still plenty of time to build a top-notch list of potential market leaders. Both IBD or Investors.com help you zero in on the big movers immediately.


In fact, the weekend is an excellent time to update your watch list and study the market. [Weekly charts](http://research.investors.com/ibd-charts.aspx?cht=pvc&type=daily&symbol) give you a good sense of a stock's general direction. You can focus on what the market has done without the distraction of work, school or the market's intraday fluctuations.


So, what are some savvy ways to update the list?


If you haven't looked at the market all week, start by reading [Monday's Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm ). (Subscribers to [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) may also check out the [Weekly Big Picture](http://leaderboard.investors.com/thebigpicture/default.aspx), published on Friday evening.) You'll get an idea of the overall market landscape and any ongoing themes. If you can afford a little more time, scan the [other Big Picture columns](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm); they often highlight stocks that are breaking out or close to doing so.


For more in-depth analysis on which companies are leading the market, read a New America profile or two. As you read, ask yourself: Does the company have a hot new product or service? Does it stand to benefit from some kind of shift in the economy? [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm) will tell you.


The [Internet & Technology section](http://news.investors.com/technology.aspx?nav=NewsTechnology) will give you detailed analysis on stocks and fast-changing trends in those respective fields.


Devote at least an hour toward IBD's three computer-generated lists of current market leaders: [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?start=ibd) (on Monday and Wednesday), Big Cap 20 (Tuesday) and Your Weekly Review (Friday).


Scour the mini charts and read the chart analyses on the bottom of each chart to see what stocks are setting up now.


Did you miss a breakout and it's now more than 5% extended? Jot its ticker on a separate watch list and track it each weekend. It may pull back to a follow-on buy zone or build a new base.


The Weekly Stocks On The Move screen in Monday's paper is another great place to find quality watch list candidates.

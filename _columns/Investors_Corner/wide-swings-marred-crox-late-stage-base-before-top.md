As the saying goes, "What goes up must come down." But sometimes, it's difficult to see the end of a big run-up in a seemingly unstoppable stock.

Still, a top is inevitable. One of the keys to successful investing is to get out before all your gains evaporate. Adhering to buy and sell rules and learning to recognize warning signs can help investors maximize profits and minimize risk.

Stocks can come back down to earth for various reasons, be it a slowdown in earnings or sales, an industry shift or even a federal investigation. Or it could be purely chart-related â€” the stock has been going up for so long that it needs to take a breather to digest its gains. No matter what the case may be, the peak will show up in the stock's chart at some point.

One way to gauge a stock's exhaustion level is by keeping track of the number of bases it has formed on its way up. Stocks tend to make their biggest rallies after breaking out from early basing patterns, typically first- and second-stage bases. After that, gains can become more limited, and the risk of a failed breakout increases.

"Sell when your stock makes a new high in price off a third- or fourth-stage base," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "The third time is seldom a charm in the market. By then, an advancing stock has become too obvious, and almost everyone sees it."

Late-stage patterns often appear wider and looser in price behavior than earlier bases, which makes many of them faulty.

**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) provides a prime example of aleader that topped after breaking out past a fourth-stage base. The footwear maker marked a multiyear high on Aug. 1, 2011 before pulling back to start the left side of a potential new base, its fifth.

That same week, it reversed lower to close down 9%. The following week, it sank as much as 17% before ending with a 0.6% gain. The stock continued this whipsaw action for the next seven weeks as it indecisively straddled the 10-week moving average.

Crocs fell as much as 12% the week ended Oct. 7 and breached its 40-week line before closing near the top of the week's range **(1)**. It climbed the next week, before the other shoe dropped. The stock plunged 43% the week ended Oct. 21 in huge volume **(2)**.

Its 39% loss on Oct. 18 accounted for most of that slump, which occurred after the company lowered its third-quarter earnings and revenue guidance a week ahead of its quarterly report, citing softness in sales.

Investors got an early warning in March 2011, when the stock fell 16% below its buy point from the fourth-stage cup with handle breakout **(3)**. That's a sell signal.

The stock managed to come back and advance from there, but the volatile action and late-stage character flashed further warnings.

Crocs had peaked once before, after a big run from its Feb. 8, 2006 debut. The stock came public at 10.50 a share and formed a series of bases right from the get-go. By mid-May 2007, it had cleared four bases (two base-on-base patterns) and triggered the eight-week hold rule.

But it peaked before plunging 31% the week ended Nov. 2, 2007, in huge volume.

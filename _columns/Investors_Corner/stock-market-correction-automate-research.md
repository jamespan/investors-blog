A stock market correction is the time to build watch lists of leading growth stocks. It is also a good time for investors to expand their palette of research tools and resources to help find those stocks.




One web page with which it pays to familiarize yourself is the [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) page at Investors.com.


The page, found under the "Stock Lists" section, offers a number of market orientation tools. The top table of 24 separate tools points to thousands of leading stocks, broken down according to various measures.


The most commonly used portions include [IBD Smart NYSE & Nasdaq Tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-apr-03-2018/) and Industry Group Rankings tables. The Smart Tables list the daily performance and ongoing fundamental and technical metrics of hundreds of leading stocks, divided into IBD's 33 industry sectors. It also lists all of the [IBD Sector Leaders stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), the basic vital signs, at the top of each sector list. During a stock market correction, fewer stocks tend to appear as Sector Leaders.

[IBD's Timesaver Table](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/timesaver-table-apr-03-2018/) is a condensed version of the Smart Tables. It lists the prior day's action among stocks with [IBD Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 95 or above.


The [Industry Sub-Group Rankings Table](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/understanding-the-link-between-industry-groups-and-institutional-investors/) allows investors to keep tabs on performance among IBD's 197 individual industry groups. Those [rankings are a critical corroborating factor](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/understanding-the-link-between-industry-groups-and-institutional-investors/) in determining the viability of a leading stock.


You can cross-reference that list with the [Groups With Highest % of Stocks at New Highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/groups-with-highest-of-stocks-at-new-high-apr-03-2018/) tool, in the page's left-hand column. Use the [Find Your Group's Sector](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/find-your-groups-sector-2017/) function to determine which sector an industry group falls within.


Put The Stock Market Correction To Use
--------------------------------------


Possibly the most valuable tools on the page for many investors are the automated stocks screens. They crunch through many hours' worth of research to serve up stocks with top fundamentals and timely chart action. You can quickly scan through tiers of market-leading stocks, many of which are either building bases or near buy points.


Start with the list of [Top 200 Composite Stocks](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/top-200-composite-stocks-apr-03-2018/). The [Stocks Out Of Bases](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/stocks-out-of-bases-apr-03-2018/) option is one way to find stocks breaking out and sometimes still in buy range.


The [New Highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-apr-03-2018/) List shows stocks hitting 52-week or all-time highs. That's what happens when the best stocks break out. [Tech Leaders](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-tech-leaders-apr-03-2018/) gives technology names with the strongest combined [Composite, EPS and Relative Strength Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/).


The search parameters for some lists, such as Preferred Stocks, are tough to meet. In the current, volatile stock market correction, the list shows no stocks. Income investors will want to study the [Dividend Leaders](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/dividend-leaders-apr-03-2018/), [Utility Leaders](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/utility-leaders-apr-03-2018/) and [REIT Leaders](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/reit-leaders-apr-03-2018/) lists.


Also check out Psychological Indicators & Volume at the page's lower left. [This tool can be handy in gauging market reversals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/be-ready-to-act-when-market-sentiment-reaches-extreme-levels/). Scroll down and you will also find extensive lists and performance breakdowns of Funds and ETFs. Scroll further for bonds, and commodities futures and spot prices.


The Goal Of Automating Watch List Picks
---------------------------------------


There are too many tools on the page to discuss here. Some investors gravitate to one or two particular screens as sources for winners. Others cast a wider net and diversify their research. The goal is to find the most technically and fundamentally sound stocks, below buy points in valid bases. Having [a checklist of these characteristics](https://www.investors.com/uncategorized/use-checklist-to-build-your-watch-list/) helps.


But investors can ultimately save themselves time by learning to use these powerful tools, and working them into their own investing strategies. [Many accomplished CAN SLIM investors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-smart-investor-never-forget-what-the-m-is-doing/) download the lists to Excel files, then run them through additional screens to nail down stocks with the specific characteristics they seek.

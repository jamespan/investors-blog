_Eighth In A Series_

Simplicity is a good thing. Investing should also be kept simple.

Investors should be either long, short or simply waiting on the sidelines at any one time.

A big part of making money is being on the right side of the market at the right time. Different dynamics are at play that pertain to whether the market is in bull or bear mode.

In a bull market, focus on top-rated companies. Most stocks tend to go up in a bull market; that's when you want to be in buy mode.

Remember that the direction of the market has a lot to do with whether you'll have a winning or losing trade. In an up market, why fight the trend when you have the wind at your back?

Investors should only be shorting stocks in a bear market. That's the time when leaders break down.

Trying to play both sides can be costly. You could actually lose on both trades, which could damage your confidence. So why waste precious time and effort when a clear bull or bear market is in place?

When the market ushered in a new uptrend with a follow-through in March 2009, that was the time to buy stocks. **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) cleared a 27.52 buy point in a cup-with-handle base July 15 **1** that year. It doubled by early December before settling into a new base **2**. Chemical maker **NewMarket** ([NEU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEU)) and other leaders also broke out to new highs and big gains.

Hedging a position with options and futures can make life more complicated and create potential problems.

For example, you can sell call options on a stock you already own. This strategy is known as a covered call, which could give you a little bit of protection on the downside.

But by selling the call, you've capped your upside potential. Let's say you bought a stock at 50 and sold a call option with a 55 strike for a premium of \$1, or \$100 per contract. If the stock shoots to 75, too bad. You've obligated yourself to selling your stock at 55.

Instead of using derivatives, your best hedge is to keep things simple. Dump your stock when it falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price. Also, just sell and take your profits if your stock gives sell signals.

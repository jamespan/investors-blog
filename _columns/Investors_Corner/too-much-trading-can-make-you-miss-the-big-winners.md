*10th In A Series*

  

"Helicopter parenting" is a label slapped on moms and dads compelled to hover over their kids to defend them from and usher them through even life's most minor challenges.

  

Such micromanaging is widely considered ineffective, even damaging, parenting. The same holds true in the investing trade.

  

A helicopter investor would be one who overtrades. He or she jumps out of and back into a stock, attempting to protect his or her capital from every market twitch.

  

Overtrading may also involve hopping repeatedly from one stock to another, always seeing weeds on this side of the fence, flowers on the other.

  

He or she may also feel compelled to dive into a battle with a choppy market, too eager to take a breather while volatile circumstances sort themselves out.

  

**Buy Right And Hold On**

  

The antidote to all these foibles is a mix of patience and discipline.

  

Buying at the right time helps a lot. Bought at a proper buy point, a true leader breaks out and immediately provides a profit cushion. This helps an investor hang in while the stock goes through a normal pullback before kicking up into a more significant run.

  

Buying too long after the breakout may trigger the 8% loss-cutting sell rule.

  

If that stock comes back up through the same buy point, it is a valid target for purchase again. But you have to judge the surrounding circumstances before you leap back in. What are the market conditions? Is it a late-stage base? Is the industry group under pressure?

  

All of these factors can set you up for another quick sell.

  

If you bought correctly at the onset of a market uptrend , being spun out of one stock for the right reason lets you rotate that capital into a better performer in your portfolio.

  

This means buying in at a second or maybe even third-stage base, or at follow-on buy points such as three-weeks-tight patterns or rebounds from support at the 10-week moving average.

  

But this is different than opening a new position at those advanced stages. An existing position would already own a sizeable cushion above its initial entry.

  

You must manage your cost basis by pyramiding. That's when you add shares as a stock makes progress from its buy point.

  

Correct follow-on buys distribute risk properly. They do not leave capital vulnerable to the vagaries of a choppy market.

  

If you find yourself shaken out of all of your positions, or if your remaining positions have all entered late-stage phases, your best use of time may come from searching for leading stocks forming new bases.

  

The IBD 50, Stocks on the Move, Stock Spotlight and Timesaver Table are great places to begin your research.

  

You'll instantly form a watch list of the top companies in the market. These are the kind of stocks that give you a chance at big gains — 20% to 200% or more — over the long run.

  

Market pullbacks can be brief, and market follow-throughs tend to trigger multiple breakouts. When they do, you want to be well-versed, ready to make smart buys and position yourself for the next uptrend.

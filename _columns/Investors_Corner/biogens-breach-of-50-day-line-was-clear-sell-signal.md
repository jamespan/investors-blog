No stock can go up forever, no matter how strong its fundamentals, how much profit you've made with it, or how much higher you think it can go. The case of **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) earlier this year showed why it's important to set aside expectations and emotions and follow the sell rules laid out by IBD.


By all accounts, Biogen had the characteristics of a true market leader. It quadrupled in the three years after it broke out past a 120.76 buy point of a flat base in February 2012.


By the time it cleared its most recent base, in December 2014, the stock still enjoyed excellent ratings from IBD. The Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings both scored a 98, indicating that it was outperforming 98% of all stocks based on all key IBD metrics.


Profit had risen 52%, 62% and 75% in the last three quarters of 2014, respectively. Sales growth was also robust, climbing 40%, 37% and 34% during that period.


However, a stock can break down long before its fundamentals start to show weakness, and that's exactly what happened to Biogen.


Biogen broke out past a 349.10 buy point of a big cup with an unusually long handle in the week ended Dec. 5, 2014.


The market was in a confirmed uptrend, a prerequisite for any stock seeking to rise to new highs. Also, volume was heavy as Biogen crossed its buy point.


But there were several signs that all was not well with the stock.


First, the base was a riskier late-stage pattern that had formed after the stock had already enjoyed a long advance.


Also, the handle was unusually long and deep, which was a flaw.


**A Hairpin Curve Lower**


Nevertheless, the stock continued to rise, soaring 15% to an all-time high of 480.18 during the week ended March 20 of this year. That was good for a 38% gain from the buy point.


But the stock dropped nearly 10% in heavy volume the next week, ending at the bottom of its range.


That was the first sign that something was wrong.


After several weeks of sideways action, Biogen broke through support at its 50-day moving average in heavy volume in late April **(1)** following a disappointing quarterly earnings report that was accompanied by lower-than-expected sales of its multiple-sclerosis drug Tecfidera.


Top growth stocks that miss earnings estimates or suffer a product glitch tend to get punished harshly, and the break of a key support line in heavy volume triggered a key IBD sell rule.


Investors who failed to heed that warning saw the stock trend sideways for a number of weeks before breaking down in a high-volume nose dive in late July.


The break of the 50-day line (or 10-week line on the weekly chart) followed by sideways action created the right shoulder of a [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/103015-778384-the-rule-for-how-to-sell-short.htm) â€” a classic short-sale setup. The [Short Side column in Monday's paper](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/103015-778384-the-rule-for-how-to-sell-short.htm), page B16, details how to spot Biogen's recent short-sale entry.


Today, the stock is 37% off the March peak and well below the 349.10 buy point.

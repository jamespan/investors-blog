Energetic, highly motivated people prefer forward motion. Once a project is through, it's done — and time to move on to the next challenge.

But whether the discipline is music, golf, medicine or stock trading, setting aside some time to study past results is one excellent way to improve future performance. A thoughtful review of your trades, at the end of each quarter or even just once at the end of the year, can teach volumes about how to profit from adjustments in behavior.

"When I started investing, I made most of the same mistakes you've probably made. I know how bad habits are formed and how hard it is to break them," William O'Neil, IBD founder and chairman, wrote in "The Successful Investor." "But break them you must, so you can develop new habits based on how the market actually works."

In some pursuits, it might not be exactly healthy to make a habit of going over past mistakes. But bad trades, those in which you lost money or saw healthy gains whittled to naught, are generally the best instructors.

**Both Ends Of The Trade**

Look at your buys. Did you jump in before a buy point, then see the stock fizzle? Or maybe you got in too late, or pyramided into your position too hesitantly, driving up your average cost. Did you open too large a position well past a follow-on buy point? Did you buy into a weak-volume rebound or move past a buy point?

Next, look at your sells. Did you bail out too early? Did you miss key sell signals? Was the market choppy? If so, maybe you should have set your sell triggers earlier to lock in smaller but more assured gains.

Hindsight is a wonderful teacher. What do I know now that I didn't know when I bought Acme Bezel? Maybe the bezel industry was wobbling due to Russian sanctions. Maybe production was outpacing supply, pushing prices into a weak corner. Maybe new smart-bezels were hitting the market, making more traditional bezels obsolete.

You are looking for anything that might act as a guide for future trades. But the most helpful clues are often commonalities in the trades. Consistent mistakes are perhaps easiest to spot and remedy. Periodic mistakes require more discipline; you must remember the rule until the same factors combine in a trade again.

**Write**

This is why keeping a trading journal can be a wise financial decision. Keep a spiral notebook with buys, adds and sells, including market factors and what you were thinking and acting on at the time. Or use a loose-leaf folder, into which you can place stock charts marked up with your own analysis.

A few pointers for what to include in your trade journal:

• **Write down the chief reason you are buying the stock.** If you find this difficult to do, then it's probably a sign that you haven't sufficiently researched the stock.

• **Study the base and mark the weeks of accumulation vs. weeks of distribution.** Note if trade is wide and loose (a sign of weakness) or tight (support).

• **Establish your exit strategy and your actual exit price**. Yes, this requires time and effort. But it will provide an invaluable mirror with which to study your own strengths and weaknesses so that you can begin reinforcing one and eliminating the other.

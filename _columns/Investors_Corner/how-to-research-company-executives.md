The stock market takes a lot of flak for being impersonal. Arguments for or against automated trading aside, stocks are bought and sold by people. People manage and staff publicly traded companies that sell goods and services to, you guessed it, other people.


In the end, it's all very personal.


Many times, successful investors are buying into visionary leaders as much as they are the actual companies. This is true for many when it comes to **Facebook**'s ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) Mark Zuckerberg, **Tesla**'s ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) Elon Musk or the omnipotent aura of **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) Steve Jobs. In other cases, the leaders have less star power but carry a solid background with successful companies.


That's why every investor's fundamental research regimen should include a look at a target company's executive management. It takes only a few minutes to get a general sense of who you are dealing with.


Chase down a company's annual 10-K [Securities & Exchange Commission](http://www.sec.gov/) filing. These forms, as well as profiles on the company's website, list executive management and detail their experience. If it's a young company, look for the 424b prospectus filed prior to the [initial offering](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm).


Do quick searches of the executives by reading past articles in IBD's [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm) and [Internet & Technology](http://news.investors.com/technology.aspx?nav=NewsTechnology) sections. Get some sense of where the executives came from and what their accomplishments and failures are.


A search for news on the Web is also important, because 10-Ks won't tell you an executive's failings.


Brilliant inventors, creators and visionary thinkers often make lousy executives. In contrast, some of the best managers have climbed the ranks amid difficult circumstances. They understand a company and its markets from the customer level up.


Are there any managers to watch today?


Consider the new **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) CEO, Steve Easterbrook. He took the management helm in March and announced a vast restructuring and turnaround strategy at the beginning of May.


Easterbrook is a Brit who was an accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers before shifting to a management position with McDonald's in London in 1993. He earned the company's top management slot, first in the U.K., then in Europe. He left for several years to run London-based restaurant chains PizzaExpress and Wagamama.


Easterbrook re-upped with McDonald's in 2013, earning the title of global chief brand officer.


McDonald's shares jumped 5% in late January on news of Easterbrook's appointment, then rose another 8% over the next five weeks. They've been basing since early March as investors wait to see whether Easterbrook proves to be a genuine force for change.


**Yahoo**'s ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) Marissa Mayer is not a brand-new CEO, but her task is no less Herculean.


She joined **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) in 1999 as the company's 20th employee and first female engineer. She helped build the company, had ups and downs, and notched notable successes, but she had no real experience outside the Google cocoon or as the ultimate decider atop the management heap.


Yahoo shares have risen 231% since Mayer took the CEO post in July 2012. But the stock is down 15% so far this year.

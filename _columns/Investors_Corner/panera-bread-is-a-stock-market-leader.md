[Patterns To Market Wealth:](http://news.investors.com/special-report/627625-patterns-to-market-wealth.aspx) Seventh In A Series

A cantankerous market ahead of a presidential election is no big surprise.

But, regardless of the cause, a correcting market places otherwise healthy stocks under pressure. These are prime breeding conditions for base-on-base chart patterns.

A base-on-base pattern forms when a stock completes a base, breaks out, moves up less than 20%, then starts another consolidation. This consolidation often dips back to, or below, the original base's buy point.

The behavior can be misleading. The stock may seem indecisive. As an investor, it can be frustrating. If the base dips 7% to 8% below the initial buy point, it's a sell and you're out.

But often, the base-on-base patterns will form fully above the prior buy point. The stock is trying to rally, but is running into selling pressure created by general market conditions. It reacts by consolidating and forms a new structure.

Look at **Panera Bread**'s ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) chart. It logged a solid big-volume breakout from a flat base on Sept. 12. **1**. It immediately began trading sideways, setting up a potential flat base with a 173.72 buy point.

Once the market improves, a base-on-basing stock is free to restart its rally. Stocks that form base-on-base patterns are often first to emerge, and to new highs, when markets do begin to rally.

"It's like a spring that is being held down by the pressure of a heavy object," wrote IBD Chairman and founder William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

In Panera's case, the new pattern also includes a test of the 10-week moving-average **2**, as well as a three-weeks-tight pattern coiled inside that already tightly wound spring.

Still, there is no guarantee. Restaurants in particular have faced difficult challenges in the past year with fickle consumer behavior and price inflation. So all the standard buy and sell rules still apply. But the pattern makes Panera a stock to watch.

If the low of the second part of the base undercuts the previous low, then it isn't a base on base. The undercut would establish the second part as a new, first-stage base. **Catamaran** ([CTRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRX)) is a good example. Its current base undercut the prior structure, so it was not a base-on-base.

If the gain out of the first pattern is 20% or more, then the following pattern is not a base on base. The second pattern would be a new base.

Base-on-base structures can stack multiple consolidations, one on top of the other. As long as the distance from buy point to the lip of the new consolidation is less than 20%, the entire complex counts as a single stage and does not increase a stock's base count.

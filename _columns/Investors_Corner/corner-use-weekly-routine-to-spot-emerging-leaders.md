Tracking your investments can be a lot of work, and you probably have built a routine to make sure you touch all the bases.

**Your IBD Routine:** [Part 1](https://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/564697/201103021728/High-Rev-Routine-Saves-Time-Yields-Treasure.aspx) | Part 2

If a daily routine is too taxing at times, try to clear at least one day each week to do the in-depth work needed to find those few gems you know are out there. A weekly routine may help you see the market and potential leaders more clearly.

  

Weekends are great, or you can break up your weekly routine throughout the week.

  

But remember, you get plenty of important information from IBD and Investors.com all the time. Some of it comes daily, or throughout the day on Investors.com.

  

Other features are seen once a week. Like what?

  

• **The IBD 50** is published Monday. This is the list of the market's 50 best stocks, as gauged by IBD's proprietary system of measuring earnings, sales and stock strength.

  

This is not your shopping list. It's a place to start your work. If you've been watching the IBD 50, you know it includes many stocks that you own or wish you had.

  

• **Inside The 50** also appears on Monday, usually on Page B2. This weekly feature helps put the numbers and names in context. IBD's writers take this opportunity to point out that week's big developments in the IBD 50. What's breaking out? What's near a proper buy point? Take the time to read it; you won't be sorry.

  

• **Weekly Stocks On The Move** is featured every Monday, appearing on the same page as the IBD 50.

  

Think of this as a cousin feature to the daily Stocks On The Move. The weekly version shows highly rated stocks moving with exceptional volume for the week.

  

Each stock must trade at least \$20 a share with an average daily volume of at least 60,000. Stocks showing a weekly gain must possess EPS and RS Ratings of at least 70, and annual EPS estimates must reflect at least 15% growth.

  

For the week, it must show at least a half-point price change.

  

Your Weekly Review, also known as the IBD 85-85 Index, includes stocks with RS and EPS Ratings of at least 85 each. They must also trade at least within 15% of their 52-week high.

  

In good times, the 85-85 list will be crowded. In lean times, the cupboard is almost bare, and sometimes what's in there isn't so hot.

  

In addition to the high ratings, stocks that aspire to Your Weekly Review must trade at least \$10 per share, within 15% of their 52-week high and must have average daily volume of at least 10,000 shares.

  

• **The New America** is a daily feature that may actually fit into your weekly schedule. Not enough time to read it on Monday? Don't throw out the paper. You need to read this feature to discover the great new companies doing miraculous, new things. Let the newspapers pile up if you have to, then go through them over the weekend.

The double-bottom base is one of the [bullish chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) commonly formed by top stocks in the stock market, alongside the venerable [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). If you can spot a good double bottom during a bull market, then wait for a [strong breakout in big volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). It just may lead to handsome gains and a nice boost to your portfolio's return.




At its core, the double bottom is shaped like the letter W. But an important distinction is that the second leg down should undercut the first.


IBD's longtime former chairman and founder [William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), who developed the chart-reading strategy for stocks that have all [seven CAN SLIM characteristics](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), says the undercut of the second leg — even by just a penny — is a necessary shakeout as a final purge of weak holders before the stock can advance. In that respect, it serves a similar use to the handle in a [cup with handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/).


A second leg that doesn't undercut the first down leg is failure prone, O'Neil says. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the middle peak.

Many of the requirements for a double bottom are similar to those for a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). There should be a prior uptrend. The base should be a minimum of seven weeks. The correction should be moderate, usually 20% to 30% from high to low. Or a bit more if the market has had a severe price correction — think declines by the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq of more than 20% from a 52-week high.


Double bottoms can form [a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), but it's not necessary for a [sound base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). Many stocks form double bottoms and shoot straight past [the buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) into profitable territory. It's ideal to see the stock's volume pick up at least 40% to 50% above its 50-day average at the breakout.


Top Stocks In The 1990s: The Nokia Double Bottom
------------------------------------------------


**Nokia** ([NOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOK)) formed a [classic cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in late 1998. The general market began a severe and painful bear market in July of that year. But an Oct. 15 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) kicked off one of history's great bull markets, led by tech stocks.


Cellphones were just gaining in popularity, and Finland-based Nokia and Sweden-based **Ericsson** ([ERIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ERIC)) practically owned the space. Both made huge advances during the bull market.


The Nasdaq carved out a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) of its own as a September recovery attempt failed, sending stocks to new lows. That helped Nokia form a double bottom.![ICch-NOK-031816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ICch-NOK-031816.jpg)


Nokia completed its first leg down during the week ended Sept. 4, 1998 **(1)**. Notice that the stock finished higher and in the upper half of its weekly range. That's bullish. The second leg undercut the first on the week ended Oct. 9 **(2)**.


Nokia fell for the week, but again it finished in the upper half of its daily range. The careful chart reader could have spotted a pattern developing and put it on a watch list before it broke out.


Look For Big Weekly Volume On The Breakout
------------------------------------------


Nokia broke out during the week ended Oct. 23, rising 7.7% that week and sprinting past an 85.10 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). (The chart shows the entry adjusted for stock splits, including 2 for 1 in April 1999 and 4 for 1 in April 2000).


That big move helped make it one of the first big winners to emerge in the new bull market.


Nokia eventually topped in June 2000, three months after the dot-com bubble burst and the Nasdaq composite fell nearly 79% over the next 2-1/2 years.



Nokia has failed to reach that all-time split-adjusted high of 62.50. It now trades well below 10.

**An Investor's Corner Series:** [How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/739732-how-to-trade-stocks-in-a-tough-market.htm)

A choppy, rangebound market is sort of like one of those posh neighborhood streets with speed bumps every 30 feet. Fast travel isn't possible.

How should investors respond to a choppy market? Here are four possible responses.

• **Full speed ahead**: Stubborn investors will play the choppy market the same way they play a smooth uptrend — aggressively. Either they believe that market circumstances are about to change, or they mistakenly believe that IBD is suggesting that they play every uptrend as if it were August 1982 — the start of a Super Cycle.

• **Dig in**: This too involves stubbornness. Investors hold their positions. This isn't necessarily bad if the investor has a solid profit cushion in a stock. But opening a new position and then automatically digging in makes no sense.

• **Small ball**: Rather than look for a home run, the investor looks for a single or a bunt: small gains and small losses. The key is to preserve the 3-to-1 ratio. Profits taken should be three times greater than losses; e.g., 15% gains and 5% losses, 12% gains and 4% losses, or 10% gains and 3.3% losses.

• **Go to cash**: This is simple. Get fully or mostly out and wait for a stronger market.

You can make an argument for any of these approaches except the first. Refusing to adapt to the market is folly. The market never loses a shoving match.

A choppy market has two features. First, no index gets far in any direction without reversing, and most stocks follow the trend. Second, the spreads between the highs and lows of the day may be wider than desirable. Wide spreads create head fakes.

One way to gain a sense of how to play a choppy market is study a recent period. Let's take a look at the current market since December; it's been choppy.

Would investors have been better off with small ball or nearly all cash? (Here, we consider only new positions. It's possible that holding stocks from previous breakouts would provide a different story.)

Breakouts studied involved only stocks with IBD Composite Ratings of 90 or better that broke out since early December. Breakouts that occurred while the market was in correction weren't included. Also, very recent breakouts weren't included because they are too new to judge.

Sixteen stocks fit the criteria.

How many of the 16 never made much progress after the breakout and eventually triggered the 8%-loss sell rule? Three.

How many triggered the 8% sell rule but first delivered a gain of 7% or more? (In other words, the investor should have been out before, or at least as, the position turned negative.) Two.

How many failed to complete a [pyramid trade](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/694194-pyramiding-involves-making-a-series-of-buys.htm)? (This involves opening with a half position and adding shares at the up 2.5% and up 5% levels.) Five. Here again, the disciplined investor would not have hung around long.

How many notched a gain of 10% or more? Only one: Indian lender **HDFC Bank** ([HDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HDB)) rose 13% before pulling back (please see chart above ).

Overall, there were few success stories.

Would buys at the 50-day moving average have been better?

Four stocks made decent moves off the 50-day line. The gains were 3%, 9%, 10% and 12%. When you factor in the rarity of a perfect entry and exit, the choppy market doesn't give investors much to work with.

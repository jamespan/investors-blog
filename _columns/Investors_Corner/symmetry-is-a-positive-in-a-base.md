  Insist On Seeing Symmetry In A Stock's Base

Your mom probably told you not to judge people by their looks. But when deciding on what stocks in bases to buy, you should focus on appearance. When you're studying bases for possible buys, two traits that you want to see are symmetry and smooth price action. Having both features in your target stocks will give you a better shot at a successful trade.


Smooth price action means exactly like what it sounds like. It's the opposite of jagged, wild and loose price action, a flaw.


When a stock is forming the left side of a base, you want to see it retreat in a controlled and sometimes even gentle fashion, where price action is not all over the place. Pullbacks can occur, but they should not be too wild or out of character with the stock's past history.


Not every week within the base absolutely must show mild action. But smoothness signals that the pros are supporting the stock and steadily building their positions.


Armed with millions of dollars to put to work, institutions spread their buying over a period of time. It can last weeks or longer. Because of their size, they can't enter a stock all at once without running up the price too much. Deep pullbacks and wide-and-loose action point to a real battle going on.


Smooth price action on the right side of a cup pattern lets you know that institutional buyers are in charge, which bodes well for a future breakout.


Look at it from another perspective. When you buy oranges at the supermarket, do you grab the ones that are perfectly round, shiny and fresh-looking or the ones that have indentations or extra lumps here and there? How about those that are already all dried up?


When you buy stocks, you want as many positive traits lined up in your favor as possible.


A proper base should also show symmetry. Simply put, the base shape should have a balance in proportions. Lopsided price patterns tend to be faulty.


For example, in a cup pattern, the amounts of time on the right and left sides don't have to be equal, but they should be similar. In a 10-week cup, the low of the pattern should occur at or around Week 5, the halfway point.


In the case of a double-bottom base, both sides should resemble each other. If you're looking at a 12-week double-bottom pattern, the amount of time needed to create both legs should be similar.


If the first leg took six weeks to form, then ideally the second leg should also take about six weeks. It doesn't have to be exact. You just don't want a situation where the first leg formed over, say, only two weeks and the second formed over 12 weeks, or vice versa.


**Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) formed a nine-week cup-with-handle base with a 35.26 buy point in late 2013. There were a couple of down weeks with wide spreads **(1),** but nothing too out of the ordinary. The left side of the base spanned five weeks. The right side was four weeks in length.


Spirit gapped up and cleared the 35.26 trigger in the week ended Oct. 11 in heavy turnover. Shares of the deep-discount airline bolted 81% by late March before settling into another base **(2).**

Why is it that a hot new stock can soar on its first day of trading and soon be down in the dumps?

The answers vary, but for investors the signs of a post-IPO collapse rest in the stock's chart and the unique circumstances that come with fresh faces.

First, let's take care of an important housekeeping item: Never buy a stock on its first day of trading. Not only is it often difficult to buy shares on the day of an initial public offering, but price behavior tends to be wild.

Instead, wait for the new issue to trade for at least a few weeks, and see if its price can first find some sort of trading range. Also look at volume: Is it forming some sort of rhythm? You should avoid stocks that are making big price swings, or those that can't stay on a price trend for long. Such behavior indicates uncertainty about the stock.

You want to see a new issue form what's known as an IPO base, a pattern shorter than normal bases, yet shallow enough that it doesn't reflect major selling. A decline of 20% is acceptable, though it can be as much as 50% in the most volatile markets.

Studying these IPO bases can help investors determine if a new stock will hold up after the first-day stampede of buyers is long gone.

Check for these details, which are part of IBD's IPO Trading Strategies, a home study course found in the [IBD Store](http://shop.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing/):

- Shares should rise sharply past the buy point and close near the day's high.
- Continued strength the first few weeks after the stock clears the buy point.
- Shares should consistently stay above the buy point.

Like with any stock, a failed breakout is bad news. Never stick with such a stock in the (false) hope that it will bounce back.

Don't expect any new issue to be successful if it never forms an IPO base or other proper pattern as it starts its life in the publicly traded market.

If there is no consolidation of at least two to five weeks, chances are the stock is not ready to break out and a long period of weakness looms.![ICcht-033016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ICcht-033016-1024x543.jpg)

In 2011, Freescale Semiconductor came apart at the seams six weeks after its IPO on May 26 that year.

The chipmaker's first five weeks of action went according to plan: Shares declined 27% and made a recovery to new highs on July 1, 2011. That marked the breakout from the IPO base with a 19.60 buy point.

Immediately, Freescale got into trouble. The next day, the stock made a bearish price reversal. A brief recovery attempt faded quickly. By July 12, the stock was clearly stressed. It was down more than 8% from the buy point, forcing shareholders to sell to cut losses short. Freescale sank as low as 9.43 and started a long consolidation.

Clearly, this was a failed breakout, not much different that what you'd see in an older stock.

In the past, we've addressed the concept of an [inside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/learning-to-invest-2-breakouts-show-bullishness-of-inside-days/). Naturally, you might ask: Well, what is an outside day?

This charting term captures unusually wild action in a stock. It could augur a future change in price trend. How long into the future? IBD's research on this is relatively thin for now. Some examples show that even after an outside day, the underlying trend can hold firm. Still, if you want to maximize your gains in a market winner or identify a stock that may be near the bottom of its decline, then read on.

On an [Investors.com daily stock chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), you'll see the high, low and close in every price bar. The high and low visually capture the trading range. When the high and low for a given day stretch past the zenith and nadir of the previous session, an outside day is born.

Such action highlights an [unusual increase in volatility](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/avoid-the-flawed-chart-pattern-why-a-wide-swinging-stock-raises-risk/). Bulls are grappling with bears in a big way. And it may signal that one side is preparing to surrender to the other. Whether the stock rises or falls on the outside day doesn't matter; the wider price swing is the key factor.

The "outside day" concept can also show up in weekly and monthly charts as outside weeks or outside months. They're easy to see on [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).

Let's consider a few examples among a few 2020 highfliers.

## What Is An Outside Day? The Livongo Example

Livongo Health, March 3, 2020: The [virtual health care manager](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/lvgo-stock-virtual-health-leader-up-in-2020/) nose-dived 9% in an outside day as the coronavirus market crash intensified. Trading surged five times the stock's 50-day average. Livongo kept falling the next two weeks. Then it bottomed out.

An 11-week base formed, showing [elements of a double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/). The stock also hoisted itself back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).

On April 7, a day after the Nasdaq's [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-update-tom-pettys-wont-back-down-ftd/), the Mountain View, Calif., firm roared out of the [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) with a 10% gain in heavy turnover. Shares climbed as much as 369%.

**Fastly** ([FSLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLY)), June 29, 2020: An innovator in edge computing and cloud technology, Fastly etched an outside day. A 9.7% slide halted a massive 11-day winning streak. Shares went on to make new highs.

**![wayfair](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICw082420-249x300.jpg)Wayfair** ([W](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=W)), Aug. 11, 2020: The online home goods and furniture retailer traded wildly two days in a row on Aug. 7 and 10, losing nearly 5% **(1)**. The next day, it turned an early 5% loss into a 3.7% gain â€” a clear outside day **(2)**. Volume vaulted almost five times its 50-day average **(3)**.

Gains from a breakout past 173.72 in an [ultradeep bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/) almost hit 96%; yet more wild days could indicate that the stock is ready to take a break.

## Useful For Index Analysis Too?

Watch for outside days in the major equity indexes too. An outside day may also hint that institutions are getting closer to a phase of becoming a force of net buying or net selling.

The Nasdaq suffered a bearish outside day on Jan. 24, 2020, a month before the [IBD outlook for stocks](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) darkened to "uptrend under pressure" on Feb. 24 and then "market in correction" just one day later.

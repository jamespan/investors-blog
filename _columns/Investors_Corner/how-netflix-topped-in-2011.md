**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

Selling a stock is more of an art, and it's more subtle than buying. Mastering sell rules is what this [current series](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx) is all about. Motivations to sell vary from cutting losses to reducing risk, from taking a profit on the way up to bailing out of a stock showing signs of topping.

  

[Sell rules](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735788) come in two general categories: offensive and defensive.

  

Offensive sell rules are triggered by stocks on the rise, trading at new highs and still looking strong to the crowd.

  

Defensive sell signals, in contrast, arise when a stock sells off and investors need to act quickly to preserve profits or cut losses.

  

When selling offensively, the goal isn't to sell at the absolute high but to get out at favorable prices before your stock has a chance to go into a serious correction.

  

"The best way to sell a stock is while it's on the way up, still advancing and looking strong to everyone," wrote William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "If you don't sell early, you'll be late."

  

A stock hitting new highs in low volume after a very long advance is an offensive sell signal worth mastering. Discipline is key. You are, on a daily basis, comparing the stock's volume to the volume seen in prior price gains and to its average daily volume.

  

If volume trails off as a stock advances to new highs, it suggests institutional investors are losing their appetite for the stock.

  

As buying demand dries up, the stock will likely stall out and dive.

  

This is especially important to watch for in stocks that have already broken out from multiple bases and made an extended run.

  

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) made a monster multiyear advance. But in 2011, the DVD-by-mail and video streaming giant revealed critical signs of fatigue. From a [double-bottom](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=2) breakout in August 2010 to February 2011, demand remained heavy as the stock doubled in price **(1)**. During this period, Netflix hit a new high in above-average weekly volume seven times.

  

Then demand began to wane **(2)** even as the stock continued to advance and rally off its 10-week moving average.

  

Volume on up weeks trended lower from early 2011 to July, when the stock topped. When Netflix broke out to a new high in the week that ended Jan. 28, 2011, weekly volume was nearly 43 million shares.

  

In the week ended July 8, the stock also shot to a new record high, but only 20 million shares changed hands for the week **(3)**.

  

Without big demand to push prices higher, an extended stock is vulnerable to a sudden and sharp decline. A high-volume reversal **(4)** the next week marked the top of its historic run.

  

Two weeks later, shares fell below the 10-week moving average, and the stampede was on. Shares tumbled 83% from 304.75 to 52.81 before bottoming.

  

At the top, fundamentals were outstanding. Netflix had a 99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating and 97 RS Rating. Return on equity was 66%. Last-quarter earnings were up 88% on a 46% jump in sales.

  

All those shiny fundamentals, though, were a distraction from the real story of waning institutional interest in the stock.

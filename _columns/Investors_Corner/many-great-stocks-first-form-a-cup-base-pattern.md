[Wealth-Making Patterns](http://news.investors.com/special-report/627625-patterns-to-market-wealth.aspx): First In A Series

  

How does the individual investor get an edge?

  

Banks have trading desks that are sharpshooting all day long. Mutual funds hold big treasure chests of cash and legions of analysts that kick the tires of companies and the economy week in, week out.

  

What is the IBD reader's edge?

  

One word: history.

  

Look at great market winners going back to the year 1885 like IBD has, and you'll discover that these stocks formed the same set of chart patterns right before launching their monster runs.

  

This series covers the major patterns to help serious readers buy a strong stock at the right time and raise their chances of landing gains of 20%, 200% or more.

  

Why do such patterns form? And why do they persist? The raw emotions that grip investors — greed, fear, hope, desperation, frustration — haven't changed for centuries.

  

The cup with handle, which must be at least seven weeks long, is the first key pattern.

  

Imagine the silhouette of a porcelain teacup. It has a left side, a bottom, a right side, and a small handle. Great stocks form such a silhouette. But first, make sure the chart shows a prior uptrend of at least 20% or 30% or more. You want evidence that the stock can run.

  

The left side shows fear. Investors rush out. At the bottom, supply and demand reach equilibrium. Then greed sets in and sends the stock up, forming the right side. The base normally corrects no more than 30% or so.

  

A handle forms because a small pocket of disgruntled or nervous shareholders finally throw in the towel. It's one last shakeout, usually in quiet volume. The handle's lows must slant downward.

  

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) brewed a seven-week cup with handle in spring 1993. The decline from high to low was shallow, just 15% — well within the maximum 33% to 35%.

  

On its May 3 breakout, the fast-growing coffeehouse chain rose 5% to 40.50 **1**, surpassing the 40.35 buy point, which is 10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 40.25. Volume shot 114% higher than its 50-day average. **2**

  

At the breakout, the Nasdaq was up 2% for the year. It couldn't catch up with Starbucks, which rallied 34% to 54 by July 6.

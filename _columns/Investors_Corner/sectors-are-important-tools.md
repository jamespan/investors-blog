In prospecting for new buys, an investor shouldn't forget to check the sector in which a company does business. IBD slices the market into 33 industrial sectors that represent broad sections of the economy.

There are sectors for building and banks, medical and media, energy and electronics, apparel and aerospace, chemicals and computers, and Internet and insurance, among others. All of IBD's 197 industry groups fall into these sectors, too.

Over the course of the past few years, the Internet, medical and building sectors have been among the top-performing areas of the U.S. stock market. Put another way, each of those sectors produced numerous winning industry groups and stocks.

So, when studying a potential buy candidate, an investor should look for a stock in a fairly highly rated sector. Of course, in a few unusual cases, sometimes a formidable stock can be found in a mediocre sector.

Sector rankings are based on a proprietary formula tracking mid- to long-term performance. You can find sector rankings in IBD's stock research tables, which begin on page B3 in today's paper.

A [sector finder table](https://www.investors.com/pdf/sectors/industry_sector_finder.pdf) is available on IBD's website, investors.com, (tucked under the "Research" tab) that tells you which industry groups are in which sector.

IBD highlights the very best stocks in specific sectors at the top of each sector table. Only names with the very best fundamental and technical characteristics make the cut, so sometimes there are very few Sector Leaders in a weak market.

Mini charts of up to 16 Sector Leaders are published in IBD each day (see page B1). The Sector Leaders screen is among IBD's most stringent, and it has performed the best over the long haul.

The Sector Leaders list in IBD on May 15, 2013, contained nine names. The market had been choppy over several months but was making progress, and a healthy leadership was emerging.

Several stocks on the list were setting up in bases. One entry, **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)), merited further research.

The blurb under the chart said: "Forms cup with handle with 60.30 buy point." It was part of the branded-drug industry group, ranked No. 56 out of 197 groups. That was part of the Medical Sector, ranked that day at No. 10.

Jazz's entry in the research tables revealed some important data. The Composite Rating was 95; it also had a top-notch 99 EPS Rating and an RS grade of 62. In some winning stocks that form an extra-long base, the RS Rating is low. But that rating can catch up fast if the stock blows out of a base on a run of several days.

The average EPS increase over the past three quarters was 41%, with the most recent quarter coming in at 54%. Analysts were forecasting 39% growth in the next report, not due until August.

Sales growth was even better. It averaged a 117% increase over the prior three quarters, with a 91% increase in the most recent quarter. Analysts expected a 28% EPS increase the following year. Jazz's return on equity was outstanding at 44%; pretax margins were running at a 60% clip.

Jazz broke out past the 60.30 entry May 22 in big volume. It gained 193% to a peak of 176.60 by February 2014 1.

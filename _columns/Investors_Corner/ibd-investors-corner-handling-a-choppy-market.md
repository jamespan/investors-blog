**Handling A Choppy Uptrend:** *[First In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/621258/201208071356/handling-a-choppy-uptrend.aspx)*

  

When the going gets tough, the tough might want to adjust their approach to investing.

  

This summer certainly has been another challenging one for investors, so here are three different strategies for dealing with a volatile, headline-driven market.

  

• **Try for singles, doubles:** Don't try to hit a home run if you're not getting much to work with.

  

Instead, just be happy with coming up with an occasional single or double. That's a smart approach in baseball, and it also can work in stock investing.

  

Instead of aiming for gains of 20%, 25% or more with your stocks, you can plan on taking profits when your stock climbs 10% from your purchase price.

  

In a tough market, that actually can be a pretty nice achievement. Keep in mind that if you have a profit target of 10%, you might also want to cut your losses sooner — at around 3%, rather than at 7% or 8%.

  

Remember what IBD's founder and chairman, William O'Neil, said in "How to Make Money in Stocks," his best-selling book.

  

"I like to follow a 3-to-1 ratio between where to sell and take profits and where to cut losses," he wrote. "If you're in a bear market like 2008 and you buy any stocks at all, you might get only a few 10% or 15% gains, so I'd move quickly to cut every single loss automatically at 3%, with no exceptions."

  

• **Take a longer view:** The real market leaders generally are able to weather a few tough months.

  

If you have real conviction about a stock, try holding it through an intermediate correction.

  

Sure, the summer of 2010 was choppy, and **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) consolidated during that time. But shareholders who resisted the urge to sell Baidu were rewarded by the Chinese search giant's advance in late 2010 and early 2011. Other leaders have shown similar strength in tough markets.

  

Beyond the real leaders, there are also the steadily climbing, more-defensive names.

  

Discount retailers, auto-parts chains and other companies have recently shown they can keep growing even in a tough economy, so they've rewarded holders who are happy to stay aboard for a year or two.

  

IBD's Big Cap 20 list, published Tuesdays, is a good place to look for stocks that are relatively steady and have large capitalizations, yet also still show growth.

  

• **Sit on the sidelines:** There's nothing wrong with staying in cash when the market isn't making any headway.

  

Some follow-through days this summer didn't lead to a sustained uptrend. The market seems to love what the eurozone has to say on one day, then hate it the very next day. It's OK to wait until you have more confidence in the general environment.

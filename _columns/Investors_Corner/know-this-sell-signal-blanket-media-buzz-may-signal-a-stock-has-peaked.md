  Know This Sell Signal: Effusive Optimism, Media Buzz May Sink A Great Stock

Heavy-duty media hype can help drum up interest in the Super Bowl, an awards show or a new superhero flick and help boost interest and ratings.


But in the stock market, heavy media coverage is often a lagging indicator, kicking in after a stock has already enjoyed a big run.


IBD's goal is to help investors find the next **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **EMC** ([EMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMC)) or **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) before they become household names. When those companies start attracting widespread media attention, it's time for investors to become cautious.


Instead, look for sell signals, such as a climax run or the failure of a late-stage base, that indicate the stock's run is finished.
In the past, popular business magazines like Fortune and Forbes often will run cover photos and long profiles of white-hot companies or big-name CEOs in part to satisfy their readers' interest in finding the secrets to success. That helps sell copies.


Today, with fewer people reading magazines and newspapers in print, it may be a little trickier to spot excessive media coverage. Thanks to the worldwide web, we now live and invest in a hyper-information age. One can follow tweets on Twitter, listen to podcasts, and watch interviews on TV shows and videos by experts, journalists and amateurs touting a stock.


But it's still worth the time to comb through the sea of information to spot instances of excessive optimism among talking heads or even Wall Street analysts about specific stocks, making companies seem to have no weaknesses or faults. After all, the crowd is always wrong at market extremes.


After a stellar run during the late 1980s to 1990s, **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) attracted huge media attention after it had already enjoyed a massive run-up.


Oracle cleared an 11.76 buy point (adjusted for a pair of 2-for-1 splits, both in 2000) in a flat base-on-base pattern in the week ended Oct. 29, 1999. Over the next year, it quadrupled to a peak of 46.47 in the week of Sept. 1, 2000, about six months after the mighty tech bubble reached its zenith.


The database and business software developer continued to attract media attention as it was peaking. IBD ran stories on the company in March 2000. In June that year, Oracle founder and CEO Larry Ellison was quoted as saying that the company's potential was "breathtaking."


![ic_110116](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IC_110116.png)Such hyperbole coming from corporate executives, analysts or pundits is usually a cue for shareholders to take a close look at the stock. In fact, Ellison's comments came not long after the stock hit a peak at 45 in the week ended March 31, 2000.


A couple weeks later, it launched into a gut-wrenching 28% plunge, slicing right through the 10-week line **(1)** in the week ended April 14. Though volume was only modestly above average, shareholders could have been forgiven for selling shares and exiting out of the position, even though the stock later rebounded to a high of 46.47.


Ellison then appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine on Nov. 20, 2000. In the months before then, signs that the stock was breaking down were even more pronounced.


Always consider what the market is doing. Back then, the S&P 500 had racked up a bunch of distribution days in late August, after the Federal Reserve's series of interest-rate hikes from June 1999 through May 2000 began to cool the economy.


Less than two months later, in the week ended Oct. 6, 2000 **(2)**, Oracle plunged 14% in huge volume after breaking down from a late-stage base. The stock not only sank further below its 10-week line, but also sliced through the 40-week line (roughly equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart). Another definite sell signal.


By September 2001, Oracle slid to a low of 10.16 — below the initial buy point triggered in October 1999. When you sense that the stock has become so popular that it seems almost everybody around you owns it, then there's typically only one way for it to go — down.


It took more than 14 years before Oracle came within pennies of its all-time peak, rising to as high as 46.71 in December 2014. Today, shares trade nearly 18% off that peak.

IBD’s stock research tables innovated financial journalism from the start when the paper first rolled off the presses in 1984. It wasn’t just an alphabetical list of companies with price, volume and a few other data points.


IBD's tables were designed to save readers time. As they have constantly evolved over the years,  they give an extensive fundamental overview of a company at a glance.


Today, IBD sorts stocks by the strength of its specific industry sector. IBD’s studies of past market winners show they came from strong-performing sectors before making big price moves. In every weekend edition, a table of IBD’s industry groups is published with the corresponding sector.


In recent days, defensive sectors like utility, mining and food/beverage rank near the top of IBD’s sector rankings, based on relative price action over a number of time periods. That will change, though, when the market correction runs its course and new institutional money comes in from the sidelines and new leaders emerge.


A sector will be bordered if it houses a high-quality sector leader. To qualify as a sector leader, a stock must meet rigorous standards from a fundamental perspective. It also must be showing market-leading price performance.


Underneath the sector leader area, top-rated IPOs that came public within the past 15 years are shown. Since a growth investor's focus should generally be on newer companies, this is solid area to troll for ideas. A minimum Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating of 80 or higher is required.

Stocks that rose 1 point or hit a new 52-week high on an intraday basis get boldfaced. A stock’s 52-week price high is boldfaced if the stock is within 10% of its high. This is a good way to home in on base-building stocks.


A black circle next to a stock’s ticker symbol means there’s an archived feature story about the company at Investors.com. To find the story, enter its ticker symbol in the top right area of the home page. If a stock’s "Volume % change" figure is boldfaced, it means volume that day jumped at least 50% higher than its 50-day average volume.


To the right of a stock’s P-E ratio, several lowercase letters indicate different things. A ‘k’ means earnings are due within four weeks; an ‘r’ means the company has repurchased stock within the past year; an ‘x’ means the stock went ex-dividend and an ‘o’ means the stock has options.

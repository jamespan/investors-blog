**Top 10 Investing Myths:** [Eighth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/604007/201203141812/top-10-investing-myths.aspx )

  

In some ways, the statistical obsessions of investing are similar to those of baseball.

  

The sports media gush over home-run kings, but few people stop to ask how much that big bat truly matters.

  

In 1998, Mark McGwire hit 70 home runs and the St. Louis Cardinals finished in third place in the division. That same summer Sammy Sosa hit 66 home runs. His team finished in second place. Three years later, Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs. His team finished second.

  

The feats that made the newspaper headlines and ESPN highlights couldn't get the teams a division title, much less a pennant or an appearance in the World Series.

  

Investing has its own obsessions.

  

Probably the most fussed-over statistic in investing is the price-earnings ratio. The price-earnings ratio measures a stock's share price in relation to its earnings.

  

For some investors, the idea is to buy a stock that is "cheap," i.e., a low P-E stock. Sophisticated value or "growth at a reasonable price" investors are aware that an unusually low P-E can be a sign of trouble, or a symptom of an industry group without much prospect for growth. So the sophisticated investor might adjust and look at the P-E in relation to the growth rate.

  

Such investors might look for a P-E ratio half the growth rate.

  

Does that make a difference?

  

A look at the 12 big winners of the August-November 2007 rally — in an Investor's Corner published June 3, 2008 — found that eight of the 12 stocks would've met the test for a P-E that is half the growth rate. But this eliminated a third of the winners.

  

So, how important is the P-E ratio? IBD research has found that if your goal is to identify a great stock, not an also-ran, the P-E ratio is worthless.

  

For great stocks, the P-E can't be too high or too low or even too average. It simply isn't relevant.

  

Some people have a difficult time accepting this. But IBD doesn't take a stance just to be different. IBD goes with the research.

  

Many IBD-style investors don't even look at the P-E when buying a stock. (If they do look at it, they use it to calculate a price target. Research shows that a big winner may expand its P-E ratio by a 2.3 multiple in its run to a peak. But investors use that only as a rough guide to potential gains.)

  

If IBD investors ignore the P-E ratio, what are they focused on?

  

Focus on fundamentals that matter to a stock's performance.

  

The key elements include earnings and sales growth, return on equity and profit margins, a new factor, accumulation, a leading stock in leading group and fund support.

  

Some great winners had high P-E ratios at the breakout and scored big gains. Some had low P-E ratios and advanced smartly. See the accompanying box.

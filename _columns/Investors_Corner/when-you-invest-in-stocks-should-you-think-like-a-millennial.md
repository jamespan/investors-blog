Will seeing the world the way a millennial sees it make you a more successful investor? There may be no right or wrong answer. After all, investing is a complex game that transcends generational differences.


The factors of success are many. They include knowledge, discipline, diligence, determination, courage, humility, emotional control, market timing and luck -- just to name a few. It's probably fair to say that a 75-year-old does not have a monopoly on all of these qualities any more than does a 25-year-old, and vice versa.


Yet in a world of constant change, Americans in their early 20s to mid-30s today generally share a heightened consciousness about what impact corporations are having on the world. Men and women of the digital generation expect, in the main, to get any information at their fingertips; they feel the impact of news around the world acutely, and naturally wish to respond more directly to a wide range of social, environmental and humanitarian issues.


Some investment experts strongly believe, then, that how the millennials invest their assets, including those they inherit in the future from baby boomers, will impact the long-term returns of public companies.


"If you think about their obsession with social media, they self-identify with brands very much as a reflection of who they are as a person," Christina Alfonso, co-founder and CEO of New York-based advisory and analytics firm Madeira Global, told IBD in a recent interview. "They want to be associated with things that are more sustainable as a brand or product."


Alfonso worked in the private wealth management industry on Wall Street before starting Madeira with a partner five years ago. Her company has grown to a staff of 10. She's hired scientists and analysts to help family offices, private equity firms and other clients evaluate investments that were made to make a positive impact on society.


The terms SRI (socially responsible investing) and ESG (environmental, social, governance) are now part of the mainstream vocabulary of the investment world. Alfonso notes that two-thirds of large corporations give an annual sustainability report. Income inequality, pollution and climate change are top-drawer issues. On the home page of [Starbucks.com](http://www.starbucks.com/), "responsibility" is the fourth word on the main navigation bar.


Members of the millennial generation "don't have the luxury to wait around to solve these problems," Alfonso said. "Investing is not neutral. Ultimately, where you put your money says something about you."


Certainly, companies that are emphasizing a lighter environmental and more positive social impact have thrived. The stock of electric-vehicle maker **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) may be bouncing around in a wide range since last summer's peak at 286, yet it's still up sharply since it broke out of a long base at 40.10 in the week ended April 5, 2013.
**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), which ranks high in the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), notes on its website that it requires all vendors to comply with the cosmetics and skin- and hair-care product retailer's ethical standards regarding forced labor and human trafficking related to the manufacturing process.


"If ULTA discovers that a vendor is not in compliance with the expected ethical standards, which include the elimination of human trafficking and forced labor within its supply chain, ULTA will provide such supplier with the opportunity to remedy any potential noncompliance through the implementation of a corrective action plan," the company writes on its website. "If the supplier fails to remedy the noncompliance, ULTA reserves the right to eliminate such vendor from its supply chain."


So, will IBD add an eighth letter to its [CAN SLIM acronym](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) for smart growth stock investing? Will CAN SLIM become CAN SLIMS, with the second S standing for "social"? In a word, no.


Jerry Dodson, the head of \$16.5 billion Parnassus Investments' family of mutual funds, points out that investing purely on social objectives alone does not guarantee success. Earnings power, sales growth, good management and a competitive edge are all important factors.


He recounts [a story](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/parnassus-dodson-wins-with-hot-tech-stocks-that-pass-esg-screens/) when one of his firm's funds decided to invest in the supercomputer company Control Data. "They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK," Dodson said in an interview in July 11's IBD Weekly. "We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone."


The Parnassus funds screen out companies that extract, explore, produce or refine fossil fuels. The funds favor companies that provide outstanding workplaces that include benefits such as profit-sharing and time off for volunteer activities and parenting. The Parnassus Endeavor ([PARWX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PARWX)) fund ranked No. 1 in the category of ESG over the past 10 years through June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return, according to Morningstar. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% gain over the same time span.

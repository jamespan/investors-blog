One thing that distinguishes IBD and Investors.com from other leading financial publications is a passionate focus on volume.


IBD tracks volume for both individual stocks and the major stock indexes (see the charts on the "What's The Market Trend?" page, today on B8). Why? It keeps investors informed on what those numbers might mean relative to the bigger picture.


Minding volume is key to tracking the behavior of hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, insurers and other large-scale investors. In the market, this behavior tells you whether smart money investors are in a buying or a selling mood â€” trends you want to trade with and not against.


For individual stocks, volume tells you if institutional investors are moving in or out of a stock in a big way. A central concept in reading an individual stock's volume is the supply of the company shares, the "S" in the CAN SLIM acronym. It links directly to the behavior of leading stocks at the start of winning runs.


**Supply Vs. Demand**


The combination of supply and demand ultimately determines price. More demand, when few shares are available, means a higher price. Weak demand and many shares guide prices lower.


Two volume elements combine to set the stage for winning stock moves. The first is the average number of shares traded each day. IBD uses a 50-day average and generally considers a stock moving fewer than 400,000 shares per day to be thinly traded.


Thinly traded stocks are unpredictable. The share supply is so tight that a large purchase by a fund or big-money investor can produce explosive gains. When the same investor decides to book profit or change strategy, the shares can collapse.


Price also figures into this part of the equation. A stock with a healthy float, but a very low price, can be easily manipulated by large investors.


Sticking to stocks with dollar volumes above, say, \$20 million each day helps to minimize this risk. A stock that trades at 50 and averages 400,000 shares a day has a dollar volume of \$20 million. So does a stock trading 850,000 shares around 23.50, or one priced at 80 and moving 250,000 shares.


The second key element in a stock's share supply links to its chart pattern. Base patterns, such as the cup with handle, outline a transition in stock ownership. The left side of the base forms as some large investors exit the stock. This distribution puts more shares on the market, increases the readily available supply and sends the price lower.


The right side of the base forms as new funds and smart money investors build positions. This accumulation tightens supply, forcing prices higher. A handle is the final act of this play, when the price drifts lower in quiet trade, shaking out the final few disgruntled investors who want to exit the stock.


When the handle forms, it is not a point of equilibrium in supply and demand. In a winning stock, demand outweighs supply, but incoming investors are paused, waiting to see whether the price might drift lower and give them a better entry price.


When they move to add to positions at the handle's lower price, the constrained supply forces the stock to go above the buy point. Buyers rush to get on board before the stock steps up to a new level. Trading volume surges. A breakout is born.

_Second In A Series_

The best stocks, much like the best athletes, can correct their basic flaws in form.

If you see a top-rated stock building a faulty base, don't walk away in a snit. Keep an eye on that stock. First efforts often go awry.

Often, the stock will repair itself by building a new, better structure. This can appear as either a base on base or a base within a base.

Let's say the stock builds a cup with handle. The cup is too deep, the handle is too low, the entire base shows too much distribution. Any one of these flaws could be a deal killer. You're disgusted.

If the stock can't do better than that, you'd be right to walk away.

But keep looking. Maybe there's a breakout, and the stock stalls. If the stock rises less than 20%, and then backtracks and moves sideways, you may see a second base take form. In most cases, the stock would be building a base on base.

**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) formed a classic base on base in 1999. A cup with handle, which ran from February to September, was flawed **1**.

The cup's correction ran 49% deep, far too much for valid base. The left side was too steep, and the right side was even steeper.

When Oracle's rise fizzled at 18% above its 39.91 buy point (chart shows 2-for-1 split in January 2000), you might have taken notice **2**. When it followed that fizzle with six weeks of calmer, sideways action, you could have taken more notice **3**. That action met the definition of a flat base. There's your base on base.

Here's the most interesting thing of all: As faulty as the first base was, it's just the second base that matters. This is how a good stock can repair a damaged base. It simply builds another.

So let's study that second base. It's just a few pennies deeper than a 15% trading range from high to low. For all intents and purposes, that's a flat base. And what about that attempted breakout in the week ended Oct. 15 **4**, when it notched a new high? It ended in a downside reversal, but still well within the flat base's trading range.

Oracle broke out of that second base and staged the sort of performance that makes it one of the market's all-time winners.

**Sell Winners Like A Pro:** [Last In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/611488/201205211612/how-to-sell-winners-like-a-pro.aspx)

How high is too high for a top-rated stock?

That isn't a question with a one-size-fits-all answer. Many factors can affect a stock's ability to make a new high, digest the gain and push to further highs.

The chief factor is usually the market itself. A wildly bullish market is going to naturally give a stock extra thrust. A less certain market is going to act as a drag.

Another factor is the stock's industry group. If your stock is in a laggard group, then lowering your expectations makes sense. The one exception is if the stock is an awkward fit for any group.

For example, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is in the Computer-Hardware Peripherals industry group but its product lineup is in many ways different from the other stocks in its group. This uniqueness may allow it to perform well when the rest of its group is struggling.

Apart from the market and industry group, what else can an investor look at? Try this: the distance above the 200-day moving average.

An IBD study of the 1994-97 market showed that the 25 big-cap leaders topped on average 39% above the 200-day line (closing price). And 95 small-cap and midcap leaders topped 91% above the 200-day.

Does this mean the investor should sell as soon as the stock hits that percentage?

No. The key phrase is "on average." The top 10 percentile of leaders tell a different story.

While the average for small caps and midcaps was 91%, the top 10 percentile averaged 169%. For big caps, the top 10 percentile averaged 64% vs. the group's 39%. So, watch for sell signals when a stock is 70% to 100% or more above its 200-day line (less for big caps). Few stocks can thrive when the air gets thin.

By definition, some leaders won't reach the average. Studying a stock's chart over several years can provide an idea of how far a stock usually rises above its 200-day line.

Let's look at Apple since 2004. Apple is a big cap but it acted with more vigor than the big caps in the 1994-97 study.

The table shows Apple's closes above its 200-day line each year and its subsequent percentage decline. Data from 2008 was excluded because that was a bear market. Apple spent a good part of that year under the 200-day line.

Note that the lift the market was willing to give Apple above the 200-day line generally declined from the early years when new products were beginning to kick in.

This would suggest that should Apple rally again, investors would be wise to look for sell signs when the stock gets 40% or 50% above the 200-day line. But if Apple launches a new killer product and the general market is strong, the limit could get pushed higher.

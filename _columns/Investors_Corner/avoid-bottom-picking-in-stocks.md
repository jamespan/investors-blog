  Three More Sins That Investors Shouldn't Commit

In the past weeks, the Investor's Corner [column](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) has gone through a number of bad investing habits.Today's piece will go over a few more bad habits that can prevent investors from making good progress. These habits are bottom fishing, averaging down in price in a falling stock and focusing only on stocks with low price-to-earnings (PE) ratios.


Everybody loves a bargain. But sometimes, buying on the cheap means getting a shoddy product.


This can be the case when you're buying a stock that has been beaten up and hanging around a multimonth or multiyear low.


Yes, sometimes a stock will stage a nice bounce after a big sell-off. But many times, the low hasn't been put in, and the downtrend will resume.


**Pay For Premium Quality Stocks**


In the stock market, over the long haul, everything tends to sell for what it's worth. There's a reason why some stocks trade for under \$1 or \$10 a share, while others trade for over \$100 or \$1,000. The latter companies tend to have strong growth and market-dominating products and services. These are the names that institutional investors buy.


Buying weakness and hoping for a bounce is the opposite of what the [CAN SLIM investment system](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) preaches. In CAN SLIM, you buy only market leaders breaking out of bases in heavy trading. Often, market leaders trade near 52-week highs. Focus on the cream of the crop, not the bottom of the barrel.


Averaging down is another vice to avoid. If a trade isn't working out, don't buy more shares and hope to get out even if the stock rebounds. If a stock was a buy at 50, it must be a bargain at 40. And if it falls to 30, one should back the truck up, right?


Wrong. If the price keeps going down, there's something fatally wrong.


Think about this way: If a contractor you hired is doing a crappy job, you don't give him more work. Avoid throwing good money after bad. Just get out of the trade and move on.


You're going to have losses, likely many of them, when trading stocks. How you manage the bad trades will keep you in the game longer.


In January of 2014, **Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) roared lower on news that Chinese regulators accused the direct marketer of nutritional supplements and skin-care products of running a pyramid scheme.


Nu Skin fell 42% in the week that ended Jan. 17 **(1)**. There wasn't much of a comeback after that; the stock just bounced around for the next several weeks. Nu Skin tried to rebound but reversed sharply lower in the week that ended March 28. Shares plunged 73% below its January peak by November  **(2)**. Since then, Nu Skin has failed to recover sharply.


Another habit closely related to the prior two is buying stocks that have low P-E ratios, which again has to do with buying value or bargain stocks.


Again, there's a reason why some stocks trade at a high multiple. In a solid uptrend, Wall Street sees them as winners. So don't be afraid to buy if a stock has a high P-E ratio. Strong EPS growth in current and possibly future quarters tends to justify the "high" valuation.

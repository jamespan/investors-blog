A valuable exercise is to review the biggest stock market winners each year. Study leaders that you missed or mishandled, and you'll improve your chances of latching on to a big gainer in the future.

  

Today's column does such an analysis of **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)). The stock emerged from an extended period of dormancy to become one of the biggest winners in 2014.

  

Earnings and sales at the Singapore-based chipmaker were essentially flat from the quarter ended in October 2011 through the July 2013-ended quarter. Not surprisingly, the stock traded sideways during this lackluster performance.

  

In late 2013, things started to pick up. The stock broke out past a 39.84 buy point from a cup base, moving to all-time highs. It surpassed the prior peaks of 2011 and 2012 near 39, essentially clearing a two-year consolidation.

  

Huge volume in the breakout week foreshadowed better results.

  

Fiscal fourth-quarter results, ended in October, showed double-digit earnings and sales growth for the first time in eight quarters. It was the start of five straight quarters of earnings and sales acceleration that would propel the stock much higher.

  

Avago produces chips for communications, industrial and automotive markets. In May, the \$6.6 billion acquisition of LSI Corp. expanded operations into chips and software for data storage and networking gear.

  

Avago's chips are inside smartphones made by **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Samsung**and others. In 2014, an acceleration of 4G wireless rollouts in Asia, especially China, boosted demand for 4G devices and the chips they use. The highly successful iPhone 6 debut also spiked growth because Avago had won more chip placements inside the newest Apple smartphone.

  

By the start of 2014, the stock had broken out of a second cup base and was holding gains in tight trade.

  

The first opportunity to buy shares this year was Jan. 14, when the stock cleared a 54.27 buy point from a three-weeks-tight pattern **(1)**.

  

Shares climbed 20% over the next two months, giving investors a chance to lock in some healthy profits.

  

The timing was perfect because the stock then settled into a flat base. Six weeks later, a fresh opportunity to buy shares emerged when the stock broke out past 65.93 to new highs **(2)**. Volume climbed 433% above average.

  

Shares reached a 20% profit target on Aug. 29 after a bullish response to fiscal third-quarter results. Earning growth had accelerated to 70% on a 97% jump in sales.

  

The stock got dicey on Oct. 10 when shares gapped down with the rest of the chip stocks on warnings of an industry slowdown. There was a clear sell signal at that time.

  

But Avago found support at its 40-week moving average and quickly turned higher as it formed a new base. On Nov. 18, Avago cleared a late-stage, cup-without-handle pattern **(3)**. Shares climbed 15% from the 90.98 buy point before pulling back.

  

Avago advanced 99% from the start of 2014 to its 52-week high on Dec. 5.

  

From the initial breakout in September 2013, shares climbed 164%.

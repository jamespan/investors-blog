The coronavirus stock market crash left many investors asking: Where's the bottom?




Market pundits love to tell individual investors that it's impossible to time the market, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Just like signs of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) are seen at market tops, signs of institutional buying are seen at market bottoms.


A follow-through day is the key bottoming signal. Follow-throughs don't have a 100% success rate, but they have been seen at every single market bottom, so it's important to learn how to recognize them. And they often come when they're least expected — when headlines are the most negative.


No one knows when the coronavirus stock market crash will end, but recognizing a follow-through day can result in tidy profits during the early stages of a new confirmed market uptrend.


Coronavirus Stock Market Crash: The Hunt For A Bottom
-----------------------------------------------------


Here's how the signal works: After a prolonged stock market downturn, look for the first up day from an index low. That's the start of a rally attempt. The index can be the Nasdaq composite or S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is rarely used for this signal.


The percentage gain at this point doesn't matter; neither does volume. In some cases, a down session can mark the first day of a rally attempt when the index bounces from a sharp drop and closes near session highs. A close in the upper half of the day's trading range is acceptable.


After that, look for a big percentage gain in higher volume than the previous session on Day 4 or later of the rally attempt. These few days allow time for short covering to run its course, and for the rally to take root. The rally attempt continues unless the index makes a fresh price low.

Follow-Through Day Of Jan. 4, 2019
----------------------------------


A follow-through day should convey strength, like the one the S&P 500 flashed on Jan. 4, 2019. After a 20% bear market for the index in the final three months of 2018, the S&P 500 followed through powerfully on the seventh day of its rally attempt, rising 3.4% in higher volume (point 1 on accompanying image). The rally attempt started with the S&P 500's low on Dec. 26.


It was a robust follow-through day — not one that was begrudging and on the fence. ProShares UltraPro S&P 500 ([UPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPRO)), an ETF that triples the performance of the S&P 500, joined the [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) portfolio on Dec. 27, just ahead of the follow-through day. In late January, **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) joined Leaderboard when it cleared a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/).


Follow-through days with staying power tend to have a lot of stocks ready to lead the charge. That's why it's important to target top-rated, institutional-quality growth stocks breaking out of [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


If the market is serving up new buys on a silver platter, that's a good sign. But if they are few and far between, be patient because it can take a few weeks for chart breakouts to emerge. The latest coronavirus stock market crash has resulted in a large supply of stocks building new bases. But many have yet to bottom.


If an index suffers a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) (a decline in higher volume) soon after the follow-through day, it's often a sign the follow-through signal will fail. A close below the low of the follow-through day also signals likely failure, and you should start selling any recently acquired stocks.


Follow-through days don't mean it's time to jump into the market with reckless abandon. They especially tend to fail more often after indexes have fallen sharply over a short period of time while piercing their 50-day or 200-day moving averages. That was the case for the coronavirus stock market correction in late February 2020.


Instead, buy one or two stocks and see how they work. If the market uptrend is for real, those stocks will continue advancing and others will break out as well. Avoid the extremes of either jumping in too aggressively or refusing to test the waters at all.

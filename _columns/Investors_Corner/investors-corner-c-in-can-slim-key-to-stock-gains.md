Strong earnings growth is an essential element of winning stocks.

In this, the first in a series examining the CAN SLIM recipe, we'll look at the C — current quarterly earnings.

When you buy shares in a company, you become a partner. You not only want that company to earn a profit, but you also want to see its bottom line booming.

Growth is the key to the company's — and its stock's — success.

You're told Company A will earn 88 cents per share in the first quarter. Company B will net just 44 cents per share. Isn't A twice as good as B?

Not quite.

Now let's say that Company A earned 96 cents in Q1 of 2010. If it reports 88 cents for this year's Q1, as expected, Company A will actually show an 8% decline in per-share profit.

Let's add to this picture the fact that earnings declined in two of the past three quarters.

Company A is not growing. It's doing nothing new, it isn't a force to be reckoned with in its industry, whatever that may be.

Now let's look at Company B and its 44-cents-per-share quarter. Let's say the company had earned 21 cents in its year-earlier Q1.

Forty-four cents would represent a 110% EPS gain. Now we're talking about a growth stock.

Let's put some meat on these bones. Company B scored triple-digit earnings gains in each of the past four quarters. Q1 2011 will be No. 5.

Judging by this single gauge, this is no ordinary company. Such numbers suggest it's doing something new and different, and it's doing it very well.

There's no guarantee that this is the case, but when you see a string of monster gains for four quarters, certainly it warrants some investigation. This thing must be hot.

It is. Company B is **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), a market leader for every confirmed uptrend in the past few years. Consider its story:

Baidu is the biggest search engine in the biggest-ever emerging market.

Its population — especially the younger generation — has eagerly embraced technology. China's online ad market is booming.

And Baidu, with a near-80% share of the search engine market, isn't just sitting in the sweet spot. It's hogging it.

Company A is **Loews** ([L](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=L)), a diversified insurance company. It also produces and pipelines natural gas.

The stock has been moving higher in a slow-and-steady way. That's fine.

But its mediocre Relative Price Strength Rating shows that you could do better with your capital.

With Baidu's healthy RS Rating, you almost can't do better.

_William O'Neil, founder and chairman of Investor's Business Daily, conceived and wrote the column "How To Find And Own America's Greatest Opportunities" as part of a series to help readers learn the correct purchase points and sell signals in some of the best market winners in U.S. stock history. This inaugural column ran in the May 2, 2012, edition of IBD._

Do you like to see movies? Do kids like movies? Sure. A few years ago, I did a study of themes in the market that occurred in nearly every cycle. One of the five recurring themes was the leisure and entertainment industry.

For example, in the 1950s, Diners Club created America's first credit card, Brunswick's new automatic pin-spotter set off a bowling boom, and Polaroid's new "picture-in-a-minute" cameras gave people instant photos.

Then in the '60s came all the color TV stocks, **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), **Winnebago**'s ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) motor homes, and **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) fast food in the '70s. This Can't Be Yogurt and **International Game Technology**'s ([IGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGT)) computerized casino gaming were new innovations of the '80s and '90s for consumers.

More recently we've seen **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPods, iTunes, iPhones and iPads, **Priceline**'s ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) "name your own price" for vacation travels, and Hansen Natural (now **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST))).

These new, innovative leisure companies all had stock available that soared from 300% to as high, in some cases, as a mind-boggling 10,000%.

People old enough to have lived during some of these periods will remember many of these companies and will have used many of their products — and yet they never stopped to think and buy these stocks that increased in price by 3, 10, 50 or 100 times.

And this was just one industry sector in America! There are dozens of other sectors. They too had exciting new leaders pop up in new market cycles.

I'll cover in detail how you can learn to recognize the many future outstanding big leaders that in the past may have been right under your nose, but you never capitalized on them.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IC_qqq_100517.jpg)We'll use fundamental rules, charts and historical precedents to guide you to, perhaps in time, financial independence — if you work at it and not let yourself become discouraged.

The more you learn the facts of past innovative leaders, the more you'll be able to recognize the next crop of winners. They will be there, so never give up — if you want to succeed. Here are the vital fundamentals at the time of the first **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) purchase:

**4 years Earnings Per Share**: \$0.33, \$0.82, \$1.01, \$1.44

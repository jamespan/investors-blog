There is a method to the market's madness. Naperville, Ill.'s Kurt Daill found this out in his investment journey.

  

He's a longtime IBD reader and follower of CAN SLIM, the investment strategy used by IBD. He was a Daily Graphs Online beta tester more than 10 years ago. Talk with Daill and you can feel his passion about the stock market. He's persistent and inquisitive in the pursuit of investment knowledge.

  

While every investor is ultimately responsible for his or her own bottom line, the entire investment process doesn't have to be learned alone. Daill is doing his part in helping his fellow investors. He's the leader of the Chicago-Naperville IBD Meetup group — the largest of such groups.

  

"It's really been a neat thing for me personally to be involved in the community and in some ways put so much into it. As you know, the more you put in, the more you get out. There's no free lunch in this or any system," he told IBD.

  

Starting with 14 members meeting at an Irish pub in 2003, the Chicago-Naperville Meetup gang has swelled to more than 1,400 members.

  

That's not a typo — 1,400.

  

The group first tried a talking-forum format, but that didn't work out well. A switch to a training format did. In essence, they do their own seminars, covering the gamut of market health, chart action in stocks and portfolio management.

  

The group even gives out homework.

  

A lot of time, effort and coordination is involved in preparation of the material. Daill does get help from longtime group members such as Mark Chionis and Eric Krull. While based out of Naperville, the group draws attendees from other states to the meetings. The bunch has even gone global: People can now participate through webinars. The Naperville group has members from as far away as Jordan and Singapore.

  

"I think the reason that we're successful is that we stay very rigid. This group is about CAN SLIM, that's what we try to train to. We try to put a training theme in it," he said. Even though Daill is the head of the group, he admits that doing Meetups help him learn.

  

Daill previously invested in mutual funds and didn't get into individual stocks until after his 22-year stint in the U.S. Navy. "There was no time for it, you're deployed six to eight months at a time," he said.

  

Being in sync with the market and knowing the best-performing industries and the best stocks within those industries take work, focus, drive and, of course, lots of time.

  

Currently a commercial pilot, Daill credits his profession with giving him the time to focus on the market and help other investors. "One of the things that's really nice about the airline profession is that it allows me the time and kind of the mental energy to do Meetup and to try to study CAN SLIM and to understand investing."

  

His work schedule fluctuates month to month, depending on the travel season. At times he might be away from home for 300 hours a month, but some of that time is for layovers in different cities. He takes his laptop and an extra monitor with him to check the market in down times.

  

Daill's introduction to Investor's Business Daily happened by chance. He was traveling while in the Navy. "I never really knew what it was before," he said. "I picked it out of the seat pocket (of a plane). I was looking at it and became fascinated with the data in what has now turned into the Making Money section on individual stocks."

  

The vast amount of information and the actionable data in IBD struck a chord with the former Navy squadron commanding officer and Top Gun instructor.

  

"The reason it really connected with me was in all of the leadership things I had done in the military over 22 years, starting small and working my way up to bigger and bigger things, I never solved a problem anywhere without data to manage and understand what the hell is going on and actually put proper solutions in place," he said.

  

**From Mutual Funds To Stocks**

  

Coming to the tail end of his military career, Daill's interest in the stock market grew and he was about to go through a transition from being a mutual fund investor to a stock investor around 1999 to 2000.

  

"I was still in the (mutual) funds and in transition," he said. "But what was really good for me is I started getting very interested and took about 90% of my money out of funds and I started doing the CAN SLIM system, which of course in the March (2000) time frame, it was get away." The market started a monster run from late 1999. From Oct. 29 to Jan. 24, 2000, the Nasdaq shot up 45% before pulling back to its 50-day moving average.

  

Stocks such as **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **JDS Uniphase** ([JDSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JDSU)) were on fire. But by early March 2000, the market was getting hit with distribution days, and leading stocks showed climax action.

  

"Just by the stroke of luck, I ended up pulling it all out but 10%," Daill said. He was able to sit out most of the bad times. He tried to look for places to get back in, but admitted that none worked well until the market bottomed in 2003.

  

Some of Daill's favorite features in IBD include The New America, Internet & Technology and NYSE/Nasdaq Stocks On The Move.

  

"If a company is going to make a big move, it's going to go through that table," he said.

  

Like anything in life, learning to trade takes time, patience and lots of practice. On the surface, the CAN SLIM system seems simple, but it consists of a lot of pieces, and everyone learns at a different pace.

  

For Daill, success didn't come overnight. "It took a little bit of time," he said. "I can remember in 2003, early in the bull market, that I didn't have the success I expected."

  

As he recalled, "I wasn't doing too badly, but I wasn't really having success, so I started looking over trades and came to the conclusion that one of my weaknesses was I didn't know as well as I should have proper base structures, time, depth, duration, buy points, all those kinds of things."

  

Daill took action by going to his first IBD workshop. "What was fun about that was it was still taught by Bill (O'Neil, founder and chairman of IBD). Now I look at it and go, 'Oh my God, Bill spoke to us for \$150; I'd do that every weekend.' "

  

Investing is a tough game, and mistakes will be made along the way. On the plus side, there's something to be gained from mistakes.

  

**Learning From His Winners**

  

Daill said: "RIMM (**Research In Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)) and ISRG (**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) were my two best stocks of 2007, and I knew it. I sold completely out of both, losing my entire position in each instead of trying to hold on to a core 10%-or-so portfolio position with a lower cost basis in each while selling out of all the others, which were not as strong. This is a money management lesson learned."

  

On Intuitive Surgical, he made several buys between June and July 2007, with a cost basis of 143. Gap-ups can provide additional entry points, but they can be mentally challenging to buy. Intuitive Surgical staged a breakaway gap on July 20, 2007.

  

"I did not add during the earnings breakaway gap after-hours in the 172 to 175 range even though I had money (margin) available," he said.

  

Daill eventually dumped his shares at 208 and 201 as the market came under pressure in August of 2007 and didn't get back in as the market recovered. "As the market regained its footing and put on a three-month rally, I did not buy my ISRG back and watched my monitor for three months as it went up over 100 points from my sell point," he said. "This is a psychological lesson learned."

  

Daill lauds O'Neil: "He's a guy who really figured it out and was very innovative and very entrepreneurial and then was willing to share with the rest of us to say, here's how you do it. I think all of us are forever grateful."

  

There are other trading/investing methodologies out there, so when asked why he follows CAN SLIM, Daill responded, "When you step back and study former leaders, you realize that it's right. There's a myriad of systems out there. What you're trying to do is be a follower in terms of what the institutions are buying or what they have to own to compete in the environment."

  

Daill added: "One of the things that resonates with me is that all of the studies that Bill has done and fostered through IBD is that cycle after cycle, the names change, but a lot like what Livermore says, the psychology of it doesn't. The names change, the players change, but the psychology was here in 1880 and is still here now. And the more you study it, the more you see the truth in it. Basically, it's the truth and it has no agenda. I think every time Bill has a chance to talk to that, (he says) basically it's not my opinion, it's just how it works."

Investors are told all the time that no one can pinpoint a market top.


While nailing the exact top is practically impossible, the handwriting is always on the wall ahead of a market decline.


Fact is, there's no shortage of market precedent showing that market tops always occur when the institutions rush for the exits. And recognizing this action can save your stock portfolio from some serious hurt.


The warning signs pile up in the form of distribution days, higher-volume declines by the major stock indexes. Distribution is another term for severe institutional selling.


Institutional selling can be mild, or it can be intense. The mild variety might see the Nasdaq pull back 0.2% or 0.3% in below-average volume. But if volume is higher than the prior session, it still counts as distribution.


The more intense kind might see the Nasdaq crater 1%, 1.5%, 2% or more in above-average volume where the volume is higher than in the prior session. That's unequivocal distribution.


During market uptrends, a distribution-day tally can be found in IBD's The Big Picture column. It normally takes five or six true distribution days in a relatively short amount of time — typically four to five weeks or less — to cause problems for a rally.


A market uptrend can have staying power when distribution days are spread out, but when they start to cluster after a run-up, it can cause problems for an uptrend.


The Nasdaq's Day 9 follow-through day on Aug. 29, 2007, spawned a two-month rally for the market, but distribution days eventually became too much for the market to handle.


Between Oct. 11 **(1**) and Nov. 7 **(2**), the Nasdaq flashed seven distribution days. IBD's market outlook was changed to market in correction after the close Nov. 8. The Nasdaq went on to lose another 20% to 2155 — 25% off its peak — in a little over four months.


A high distribution-day count doesn't automatically mean that the market's headed for a fall. At the very least, though, a high count means that it's time to take some money off the table and get defensive.


Earlier this year, major averages were able to hold near highs despite numerous distribution days in the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The missing ingredient was broad weakness in leading growth stocks. It takes both for a market correction to gain traction.

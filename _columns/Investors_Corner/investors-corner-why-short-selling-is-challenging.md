As the market plunged 8% last week, many IBD investors watched safely from the sidelines.

  

Cash is king during a correction. But for adept investors who want to stay active, now is the time to look for shorting opportunities.

  

Shorting stocks involves selling shares that you borrow from a brokerage. If the stock falls, you can pay back the borrowed shares with shares bought at a lower price. The difference is your profit. But if the stock rises above your sell price, big losses can accumulate.

  

Even investors who profitably negotiate bull markets need a different mindset to win at shorting.

  

"Short selling is treacherous even for professionals, and only the more able and daring should give it a try," IBD founder William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

O'Neil had great success shorting early in his career, helping him buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and start his firm.

  

IBD has put together a new resource called the "Short Selling Home Study Program" to help investors who want to tackle the market on the short side.

  

It consists of three elements.

  

A chart book shows 44 shorting examples in a large format. O'Neil selected the charts himself and wrote the notes that detail the nuances of shorting, where to open positions and when to take profits.

  

A workbook provides an overview of short-selling strategies, such as when to short and how to minimize risk. A one-hour DVD features O'Neil reviewing 11 classic short-selling cases.

  

**Research In Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)) is an example in the home-study program.

  

Quarterly earnings and sales growth was still in triple digits when the BlackBerry device maker completed a cup with handle in June 2008. **1** The base was late stage, which is more prone to failure than a first or second stage.

  

The breakout failed. **2** With the S&P 500 in a downtrend **3**, the shorting opportunity arrived when Research In Motion dived under the 10-week and 40-week moving averages in strong volume. **4**

  

The short could have been covered three weeks later. **5**

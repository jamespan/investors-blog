What does it take to gain a permanent edge in the stock market? Some might say cutting-edge technology, especially if you love to day-trade or are a [swing trader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).









 
 
 Others might say, conviction in your best investment ideas and patience. Still others might say an ability to be flexible and to not let your ego or emotions zap your ability to follow sound rules on buying and selling.
Each individual is unique in experience, ability, personal networks, and goals. But there is at least one great unifying force that can help anyone improve their results: It's called education.


Those who invest regularly and deeply in their own Wall Street education are more likely to reap bigger rewards from stocks in the long run.


IBD, which started as the Investor's Daily newspaper in April 1984, is relentless in its mission to help readers learn how the stock market really works. IBD wants people to find out how the [Ciscos, Googles, Home Depots and Microsofts came to be such terrific winners](https://www.investors.com/news/top-ipo-stock-gems-which-new-stocks-next-google/) and how to find the next ones. IBD seeks to give every trader a toolbox of rules on [when to buy stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), [when to lock in gains](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/), and [how to avoid account-crushing losses](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


Indeed, numerous investors have capitalized from the lessons in IBD founder Bill O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks," which provides the backbone to the stories, screens, stock ideas and charts that give IBD Weekly and Investors.com. Just go to the "Success Stories" chapter in the fourth edition of O'Neil's best-selling classic. The book features 13 pages' worth of testimonials from among hundreds, if not thousands, accumulated by IBD over the years.


For longtime IBD readers who have taken in all that [IBD University](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/getting-started/) has to offer, there are ways to deepen one's mastery of the IBD system for selecting, buying and selling stocks. One way: study your past trades and find out what you did right and what you did wrong.


Two, consider using IBD's intermediate- and advanced-level [home study courses](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=HSProgram&src=A00272A), which you can read and learn at your own pace.


A third way is to truly take your knowledge of charts, the stock market, business fundamentals and other timely topics to a higher level by attending IBD's [CAN SLIM Masters Program](https://www.investors.com/product/can-slim-masters-workshop/), a two-day event in Santa Monica. Held every year since 2004, the program allows readers to interact with senior portfolio managers from IBD's sister firm [William O'Neil + Co](https://www.williamoneil.com/)., senior product coaches at IBD's premium charting and stock screening service [MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF) and a member of IBD's markets team.


This year, the Masters Program will begin with a review of the big winners and losers in the stock market by Scott O'Neil, son of IBD Chairman and founder Bill O'Neil and CEO of Data Analysis Inc. Studying these past examples will help you identify future great market opportunities. Why? The companies that lead the market up and down may change over time, but the forces of earnings and revenue strength, new innovative products, top-notch leadership and the emotions of fear, greed, hope and despair never change. Charts capture all of these important factors that drive the stock market.


Other topics during the [two-day intimate gathering](https://www.investors.com/product/can-slim-masters-workshop/) include the importance of price gaps, the latest in portfolio manager insights, bases and pivot point research and an in-depth analysis of the current U.S. stock market.


In the end, investing is not about perfection. Even the best pros are going to make errors in judgment. Some trades will be lucky, others not so much. But no one would dispute the fact that education is critical to achieve long-term success in the stock market.

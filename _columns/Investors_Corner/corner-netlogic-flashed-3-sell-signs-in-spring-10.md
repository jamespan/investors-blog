If you were looking for a promising tech stock in early 2010, **NetLogic Microsystems** ([NETL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NETL)) might have caught your eye.

  

It would have ended up being a smart play. But you probably would have wanted to sell before the general choppiness that hit the market in the middle of 2010.

  

It would have been tough to hold NetLogic through the second half of the year, as the stock fell as much as 35% from its late April peak.

  

With this Investor's Corner column on spotting the sell signal, we'll point out the signs in March, April and May that indicated it was time for NetLogic shareholders to head for the exits.

  

The buy point for NetLogic was at 48.10 (or 24.05, adjusting for a later split) **1**.

  

That entry point came from a five-week consolidation involving a correction of 15% **2**. This consolidation was a little odd, since it didn't really look like a square-box base or a flat base, the two types of structures that are often five weeks long.

  

Another trait worth noting: NetLogic rose straight up from the bottom, which isn't an ideal breakout.

  

Nonetheless, NetLogic cleared its buy point on Feb. 4. The stock stayed in a buying range for the next five trading days.

  

The stock was up 20% from its ideal buy point by the week ended March 19 **3**.

  

It would have been a sound move to sell during this week. After all, one smart strategy is to take profits regularly, such as whenever you have a gain of 20% to 25%.

  

(A recent Investor's Corner column went over this 20%-25% concept in detail. It was part of a series called "Top 22 Sell Rules To Lock In Gains." This [column](/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/558543/201101031816/Take-Profits-Regularly-Mostly-At-20-25.aspx) ran online on Jan. 3.)

  

But what if you didn't sell then, as the stock traded around 29 for a 20% gain?

  

You might have ended up selling around 29 anyway. That's because NetLogic sliced through its 50-day moving average in fast trade on May 4, providing another sell signal **4**. It ended that day at 29.50.

There was one other sell signal in the spring of 2010 that could have pushed you out of NetLogic.

  

It came on April 30, when NetLogic suffered its largest one-day point loss since breaking out from its latest base. The dramatic single-day loss in huge trade told you that some large shareholders were unabashedly locking in their profits.

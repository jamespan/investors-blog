Those short, one-line annotations below the mini-charts published in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and other [stock lists of market leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/)s sometimes say, "Stock is extended more than 20% above buy point; take profits."




What does that mean?


After all, if a stock has gained 20%, how do I know that it won't gain 50% or 100%? And if it is not sending any sell signals, why wouldn't I hold?


It may seem a little counterintuitive at first. But experience will quickly teach that the 20% to 25% level is often the perfect point to sell, lock in the profit, and eliminate the risk that a 22% gain could fade away to nothing.


It's a good policy in any sort of market, especially so in a flagging one. Learn to develop this sell rule into a good habit.


Date Your Winners
-----------------


[Taking a 20% to 25% profit](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) is conservative, as opposed to the pernicious hunger that always wants gains of 50% or more.


This rule keeps you from getting into a mindset in which you are psychologically married to a stock. Those are the mindsets that too often lead to holding on and watching big gains turn to little ones, or even to losses — simply because you believe, think, feel or hope the stock is going to come back and do well.


That belief may feel like it is in your heart, or like some intuitive sense about the stock. But it's really all about your ego. It's a psychological need to want to be right that keeps you holding, even as the stock gives up all its gains, then dives into losses.


When To Sell Stocks: Avoid The Round Trip
-----------------------------------------


IBD's [CAN SLIM investment system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) doesn't set a specific level at which a stock that is trimming gains should be sold. The rule is, simply, to not let a big gain round-trip into a loss.


But rules are very specific in saying that taking profits at 20% to 25% most of the time is the prudent rule to follow. A handful of these can make for a very good year. It keeps your capital flexible and your profits secured, which is a very nice combination.


Every investor will take losses. There are no exceptions, even among the pros. If you can limit your loss on each trade at 7% to 8%, and take gains on most of your winners at 20% to 25%, you are trading smart. It means that you could be wrong on three of every four trades and still come out even or marginally ahead in the game.


And the odds are much higher that you will nail numerous 20% gains over a year than gains of 100%, 200% or more.


Try Partial Strategy
--------------------


Also remember this: The strategy says sell, but that doesn't necessarily mean liquidate an entire position. Consider selling at least half your stake. In a volatile market, this strategy becomes even more attractive, raising cash and trimming risk, while keeping a hook in stocks that may yet rally.


Learning to differentiate between stocks that might go on to huge gains vs. ones in which a 20% to 25% take should be good enough takes time. But in normal market conditions, when a stock has gained 25% from a proper buy point in a well-formed base, the probability that your stock will round-trip to zero is higher than the chance that it may double to 50%.


The difference, after the fact, is that if you sell at 25% and watch the stock continue to climb, it is a lesson for which you have been paid. If you hang on and watch your gains fizzle to zilch, you've also paid to be reminded of what you already know.

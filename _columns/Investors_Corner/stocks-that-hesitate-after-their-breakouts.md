  Do-Nothing Breakouts Can Have Three Causes

When a stock breaks out and then doesn't do too much, three explanations are possible.

The problem could be the general market. The problem could be the stock. Or the problem could be the investor hasn't given the stock enough time to prove or disprove itself.

The Big Cap 20 includes several stocks that raise those kinds of questions.

**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) edged above a 54.93 buy point intraday Dec. 17 but closed just under the entry. Volume was only 4% above average, far below the 40% minimum spike that points to institutional footprints.

Big volume kicked in with a 217% spike Dec. 20, but this coincided with the stock's addition to the S&P 100 and the S&P 500. This raised doubts about whether the volume was just a technical blip as index-based funds added Facebook.

Since then, action has been relatively quiet, just as it has been in the market. The online social network is up about 4% since the Dec. 20 close, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have been only slightly better than flat. Facebook remains in a buy zone up to 57.68.

Facebook might need more time to prove itself, but also could use a stronger market tail wind.

**Precision Castparts** ([PCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCP)), a maker of parts for the aerospace, power generation and automotive industries, popped above a 263.62 buy point Dec. 18. Volume was only 17% above average, but jumped to 66% two days later.

Since the Dec. 20 big-volume day, the stock has inched down about 1%.

With the market down in five of the past six sessions, Precision hasn't had ideal conditions for proving itself.

The Street expects Precision to grow earnings 23% in fiscal 2014 ending in March. In fiscal 2015, analysts expect EPS to pop 16%. While this growth isn't great, it's solid and both represent upward revisions.

Investors still considering a purchase should wait for breakout-quality volume if and when it retakes the buy point. Those who bought on Dec. 20 aren't seeing any sell signals yet.

**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) moved above a 126.49 buy point Dec. 9, but closed under the entry. Volume was 53% above average. The stock dropped 4% under the buy point before retaking the buy point Dec. 18 in volume 82% above average.

The maker of orphan drugs is in a buy zone to 132.81. Orphan drugs are those with a patient base too small to attract most big players.

**Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) is climbing the right side of a cup base. The stock appeared to form and clear a handle in mid-December, but the handle was too low to be valid. A low handle is more prone to failure than a higher handle. However, the breakout worked.

The stock is about 5% under a proper entry at 116.55.

Are you monkeying around with CAN SLIM rules? Don't.

  

CAN SLIM isn't a car to which you can add a souped-up engine and a pair of fuzzy dice.

  

It's a well-proven investment model, one that has been developed over many years of painstaking research, including back-testing and trial-and-error experience. Plus, the American Association of Individual Investors has conducted a real-time analysis of CAN SLIM and has found it to be a superior model in good years and bad.

  

You'll be certain to find some parts of CAN SLIM that you won't like, at least from time to time.

  

Selling a stock for no worse than an 8% loss is not just annoying; it often feels like a slap in the face. But sitting through a bigger decline threatens to take you out of the game.

  

Buying too early, just before a stock breaks out of a base, also is a temptation that can be hard to resist. So can buying late as a stock has flown beyond the allowable 5% reach from a valid buy point.

  

Can you break these rules? Sure, it's your money. But then you'd no longer be a true CAN SLIM investor. And you'd almost surely end up damaging your returns.

  

Perhaps one of the most common of all rule-breaking acts is ignoring faulty price-volume behavior.

  

You see a stock break out from a base, but volume isn't nearly what it ought to be. You make excuses. You see such a lovely chart breaking out, you can't believe that the subpar volume could be a problem.

  

But if the stock is really breaking out, you expect the big funds to step up before it gets away.

  

Another mistake could be looking at a five-week base with an 18% correction and calling it a flat base. That's an excuse to buy a stock that you want to buy — not necessarily one that will rise.

  

Low handles, poor fund ownership, sloppy trade and spending too much time under the 10-week line are other flaws that perhaps some would like to ignore. After all, the thinking may go, if not for one or another of these flaws, you'd be looking at the perfect stock.

  

Fundamentals, too, can be monkeyed with — at your own peril. Even a great-looking chart needs solid sales and earnings growth, wide margins and a great new product to make complete the perfect stock. Buying a great chart with mediocre "fundies" is just enough tinkering to cost you money.

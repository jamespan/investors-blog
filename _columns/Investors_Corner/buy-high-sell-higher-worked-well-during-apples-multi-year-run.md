'What seems too high and risky to the majority generally goes higher, and what seems low and cheap generally goes lower."  -- *William J. O’Neil, "How To Make Money In Stocks"*


You wouldn’t know it by reading financial magazines and listening to market pundits on television, but buying low and selling high in the stock market is an *extra risky* endeavor that can lead to less-than-desirable returns.


When tech stocks topped in 2000, some people couldn’t wait to buy **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) after it lost nearly 50% of its value. After hitting a split-adjusted high of 100 in January, it hit a low of 51.50 three months later, tempting numerous traders and fund managers. But the stock lost another 50% of its value over the next three months. Battered investors were in “hold and hope” or "hold and mope" mode, a situation that should be avoided at all costs.


Contrary to conventional wisdom, buying low and selling high is not an easy way to make money in the stock market. In fact, it can be quite risky because in many cases, you’re buying damaged goods.


A large number of stocks selling near lows are in trouble due to deteriorating fundamentals or shrinking market share. These are two qualities you don’t want to see in a stock and are often the reasons why mutual fund managers decide to sell.


Remember, the goal is to target growth stocks that are being bought heavily by institutional investors, not sold.


Make no mistake. It’s not easy holding a growth stock for a long-term gain, especially during periods of market volatility. Some will try to break out and fail one or two days later. Others will break out, rally 10% to 15%, only to see the gain go back to break-even. A lofty [distribution day count](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764) in the major averages is often the culprit.


Growth stocks need a positive market tide to succeed. When growth-fund managers are coming in from the sidelines and putting money to work, that’s when buying high and selling higher can pay off big.


Apple had a healthy market going for it when shares broke out one year into the bull market that started in March 2003. Apple cleared a well-formed base in early March 2004 (not shown in accompanying chart). It rallied 37% before settling into a new base in 2004. It broke out again from a base-on-base pattern during the week ended Aug. 27.

But Apple was still innovating with successful product launches when it cleared a flat base in January 2005. Buying high turned out to be the right strategy again, as institutional investors continued to accumulate shares. Another breakout from a cup-with-handle base followed after that.


Bottom line: Don’t be afraid to buy a stock when it’s showing supreme relative strength and sitting near highs. There’s no shortage of precedents that show big market winners staging multiple breakouts during multiyear runs. Don’t be quick to say it’s too late, especially if a compelling growth story is still intact.

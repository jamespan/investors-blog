Thursday began well for **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), with the stock rising as much as 6% in fast trade to within pennies of a new high. A solid earnings report — the company's EPS rose 48% and beat views in Q3 — sparked the buying.

  

But most of those gains didn't stick. The stock turned tail and ended up just 0.70, or 1%, at 66.76.

  

Alexion develops treatments for various forms of cancer, auto-immune diseases and transplant rejection, where the body recognizes the new organ as an invader and attacks it.

  

Much of the better-than-expected Q3 results (sales also beat estimates) can be traced to Soliris, the company's treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which causes a breakdown of red blood cells.

  

In late September, the FDA approved the drug as a treatment for hemolytic uremic syndrome, which mostly afflicts children and often leads to kidney failure and death.

  

The weekly chart shows a couple of interpretations: a rebound off the 10-week line or a breakout past a 59.17 entry. Either way, the stock is extended beyond a buying range.

  

But last week's poor close (an 8% gain was whittled down to just 2%) will look more serious if Alexion can't regain its upside momentum soon. For starters, the stock would look better if it can close Friday in the upper half of the weekly range.

  

Looking at other Sector Leaders Thursday, you might think nothing happened. Most put in small gains or losses, while all recorded soft trade.

  

But those dull results mask a few upside reversals.

  

Biotech issue **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) started strong and sold off quickly. About midday, the stock began to claw back. You could say the stock reversed its downside reversal.

  

Celgene rose 0.64, or 1%, to 65.95.

  

Virtualization-software developer **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) ended the day up 1.39 to 95.19. It turned what was a 1% loss into a 1% gain.

  

VMware is still trying to form the right side of a new base. Even if it succeeds, it will be forming a late-stage base, a serious flaw.

  

**MarketAxess Holdings** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)), which provides an electronic trading platform to trade high-quality corporate bonds, bounced back from a 2% loss to end up 0.11, or less than 1%, to 26.22.

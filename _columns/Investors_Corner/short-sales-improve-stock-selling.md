  Learning To Short Can Improve Stock Selling Skills

Since three of four stocks usually follow the market, it makes sense to buy leading stocks during a confirmed uptrend and stay on the sidelines in a correction.


But for investors who have mastered the art of buying and selling, a case could be made for shorting stocks when the market is in a sharp decline.


When you sell short, you're betting that the stock you've sold will fall in price. Later, you buy back the shares at a lower price and profit from the difference.


Understanding how and when a stock should be sold may help improve and reinforce your chart-reading skills.


"If a person doesn't know how to recognize when a stock is topping out and should be sold, how can he or she be sure that the very stocks he or she is buying aren't actually giving off indications that they should be sold?" IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil writes in IBD's [Short Selling Home Study Program](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/short-selling/?src=APA1BQ8).


Shorting isn't easy, though. Since the market has an upward bias, short sellers can rack up a massive deficit if they don't cut losses or if they time their short sales improperly.


Just as the optimal time to buy stocks is during a confirmed uptrend, the best time to short stocks is during a sharp downtrend. In fact, the only time investors should engage in short-selling is in a bear market.


Learn the head-and-shoulders pattern, which looks like three bumps on a chart, with the bump in the middle bigger than the others. The pattern usually takes five to seven months to develop. The proper entry is set when the stock makes a last attempt to rebound above its 50-day or 10-week moving average and instead falls below the line in heavy volume.


After rising 858% from March 2009 to October 2011, **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) formed a five-month head-and-shoulders pattern. It shaped the left shoulder as it ran up to 109.90 the week ended Oct. 14, then fell back **(1)**.


Deckers rebounded to a high of 118.90 in early November, then retreated again to the 10-week line, forming the head **(2)**. The right shoulder appeared as the stock made several unsuccessful tries to recover the 10-week line **(3)**.


A short-sale entry was triggered as the stock broke below its key support level in heavy trade **(4)** near 83.32. Buy back shares to cover a short position when the gain reaches 20%-25%.

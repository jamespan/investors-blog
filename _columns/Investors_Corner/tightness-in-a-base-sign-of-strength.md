Sometimes a big market winner shows no quitting.

The stock keeps going and going, showing no indication it wants to take a breather, consolidate gains, or build a new base. But a leader always does at some point, especially when selling pressure starts to build in the broad market.

When it happens, some consolidations look a lot better than others.

Sometimes, a stock consolidates gains showing wide and loose price action, characterized by volatile price swings. Other times, the consolidation is calm.

Focus on stocks that show the latter. The less volatile the action, the better. Erratic price action in a base reveals investor uncertainty. Quiet, tight price action is just the opposite.

A stock under accumulation forming a good base should contain areas of tight weekly price closes. Tightness is characterized by small price variations from the high to the low for the week. It's also seen when a weekly close is virtually the same from the prior week.

Tight weekly closes are easy to see when a stock forms a flat base, but the quiet action is also good to see in a [cup-with-handle](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/671397-evaluating-long-cup-with-handle-base.htm?ntt=cup+with+handle+Investor%27s+Corner) or [double-bottom](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/689664-double-bottom-pattern-can-yield-solid-breakouts.htm) pattern.

Look for it when a stock forms the left side of a base. It's also good to see some tight closes as a stock rounds out the bottom of its base. Tightness is also good to see in the handle area of a cup-with-handle pattern where the last shakeout occurs before a breakout. The handle should generally show a decline of no more than 8% to 12%. Handle areas can also be seen in double-bottom bases.

Market precedent shows it's worthwhile to target bases that show tight trading. Bowling equipment provider **Brunswick Corp.** ([BC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BC)) showed several tight weekly closes when it formed a cup-with-handle pattern in the second half of 1957. It showed tightness in the left side of the base and especially at the bottom of the base in October and November **1**. The handle area started forming in December and showed constructive action with several tight closes **2**.

It cleared the cup-with-handle pattern at 35.35 in late January 1958. The rally took a while to ignite, but the stock eventually climbed 22% to a high of 43.13.

From late March, a base-on-base pattern took shape. Two flat bases with tight price action yielded a fresh heavy-volume breakout. By October, the stock rallied 120% from the initial 35.35 entry.

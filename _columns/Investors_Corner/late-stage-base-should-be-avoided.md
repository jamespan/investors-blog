While it's best to buy stocks when they break out of bases, it's smart to stay away from bases that form late in a stock's long-term advance.


After a stock has climbed from a third or fourth base, the odds of winning a substantial profit shrink considerably. That's why investors need to avoid late-stage bases.


History shows that in a market uptrend, the first base of an institutional-quality stock has a high success rate, and can see a share-price increase of 20% to 25% or more from the buy point.


After that, the second base forms. It also has a high success rate, and typically rises 20% or more before the next base starts.


But by the time a stock makes its third and fourth bases, it has become obvious to everyone in the market. As much as 80% of fourth-stage bases fail, according to "How to Make Money in Stocks."


These late-stage patterns also tend to be sloppy or outright faulty. For example, they could be too short or too deep.


To count bases and know if you're looking at a late-stage base, it's best to use a weekly chart.


Make sure you include only patterns of proper length (seven weeks minimum for cup-with-handle or double-bottom bases, five weeks for flat bases). There must be a separation of at least 20% from a buy point until the start of the next base. A [base on base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/594152-how-to-invest-in-stocks-using-base-on-base-pattern.htm?Ntt=dollar-tree-alan-elliott-base-on-base) counts as a single one.


**Bebe Stores** ([BEBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEBE)) rebounded from the 2001 recession with an earnings gain of 74% in 2005. The retailer of young women's clothing was rebounding too, and was in a major upward cycle.


A yearlong base-on-base developed **(1)** from October 2003 until the breakout in early October 2004. That was a first-stage pattern. A short base in the summer of 2003 could have escaped notice because the firm's earnings were still in decline at that time.


Bebe soared more than 70% until it began its next base. That cup with handle (**2****)** was the second-stage base. The breakout resulted in a 25% gain until the next base started: another base on base.


That was the third-stage base **(3)**, or even fourth-stage if you counted the 2003 pattern. The base didn't have obvious faults, but investors counting bases would have known to steer clear of it.


Bebe made a feeble breakout and began a 58% decline from which it has never recovered.

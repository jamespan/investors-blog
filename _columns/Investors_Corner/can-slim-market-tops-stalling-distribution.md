Imagine that the stock market has been in a smart rally for months. Your stocks are up nicely. You know that the rally's going to end, but when?

  

Watch for days of distribution and stalling. They are the telltale signs that big investors are taking their profits, and you should, too.

  

This [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/) talks about stalling, but investors need to know the difference between stalling and [distribution](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/707985-tracking-distribution-days-can-help-spot-market-top.htm). A distribution day occurs when a major index — either the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500 — is down at least 0.2% on volume equal to or greater than the day before.

  

A stalling day is more subtle. It typically occurs when a key index is up no more than 0.4%, with volume greater than or equal to 95% of the prior day's volume. So in other words, the market can actually rise while institutional investors are cashing in.

  

The index must also be making a price high — either by closing at greater than or equal to the prior two days or by finishing at greater than or equal to the high of the prior day and within 3% of a 25-day price high.

  

Another key requirement is that the price close must be in the lower half of the daily range.

  

A heavy combination of stalling days and distribution days over a five-week period can spell the end of a rally. When an investor spots them, it's time to lighten up on holdings and raise some cash.

  

**Keeping Track**

  

There are also instances of a rare type of stalling action that do not exactly fit the above criteria. To keep abreast of all such stalling days, read the Big Picture column, today on B4, and check the daily Market Pulse table that accompanies the story.

  

Stalling days are removed from the count due to time or a significant upward move by the relevant index.

  

In Tuesday's Market Pulse, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 mark five distribution days, a relatively high load. One on the 500 was a stall day triggered July 24.

  

An intermediate market top in 2012 provided a glimpse of two stalling days. On Sept. 14 **(1)**, volume rose as the S&P 500 gained 0.4% and made a multiyear high of 1474, yet it finished in the lower half of the daily range. On Oct. 1, the index rose 0.27%, also finishing well below the day's midpoint **(2)**. The index also suffered three distribution days between those dates. By Nov. 16, the index fell to 1343, down 9% from its peak.

What is a setup day?




In volleyball, a setter floats a slow, perfectly positioned pass to a teammate who's ready to spike the ball over the net and away from the outstretched hands of the opposing team. If executed well, the setup may lead to a winning point â€” and even the match.


In great stocks, the setup day can set up a blistering run.


Take a stock with [outstanding fundamentals](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) or high prospects for amazing growth in sales and earnings for months, years to come. It forms an [excellent base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). But it hasn't broken out yet: The stock has yet to surpass a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The setup day sends a stock one step closer to that delightful reality. It's a bullish day right before the stock reaches its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) that puts investors on alert.


What Is A Setup Day? A Case Study In This 2020 Market Champ
-----------------------------------------------------------


**Peloton Interactive** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) began its tremendous run with a breakout in the spring. As the coronavirus spread, forcing mass closures of gyms, demand soared for the New York-based innovator's exercise equipment that enables group classes via an internet-connected video screen. In the first three quarters of 2020, Peloton's sales vaulted 66%, 172% and 232% vs. year-ago levels. Revenue over the past 12 months topped \$1.8 billion.


After peaking at 37.02 in December 2019, the stock initially collapsed. It fell as much as 52% to 17.70 before rebounding. Then it formed a [deep double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ICpton112320-300x161.jpg) Peloton broke out past a 34.70 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on April 15. The rally faded fast. It triggered the [8% stop-loss sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Yet shares found support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and formed a handle. Yes, this pullback was too deep for a [normal handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/). But 2020 ain't normal times.


On May 5, Peloton rallied 6.8% in heavy volume. Nice. It didn't quite send shares above a handle entry at 38.18, a dime above the handle's high. But that action served up a vital setup day **(1)**. On May 6, the stock powered past the 38.18 buy point, rising 5%. More than 27 million shares changed hands, at that time the second heaviest day of trade since its Sept. 26, 2019, Nasdaq debut.


Here's a second way to view Peloton's chart action. After the April breakout failed, the stock did not spend enough time to form a new base. Instead, it cycled back above the prior [double-bottom buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) of 34.70. So in this case, if May 5 served as the breakout day, then May 4 was an equally fitting setup day **(2)**.

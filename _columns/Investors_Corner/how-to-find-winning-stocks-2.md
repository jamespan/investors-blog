IBD and Investors.com offer investors a wealth of resources to find great stocks.

  

Discount carrier **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) nearly doubled this year. But it hasn't been an easy stock to trade. Spirit didn't offer many buying opportunities and the stock experienced bouts of turbulence, especially in the latter part of the year.

  

From stock lists such as the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/top10/), Your Weekly Review and Sector Leaders to The New America and Stock Spotlight articles, there's no shortage of places to find the market's leading stocks. These are some of the must-read features.

  

Regularly reading IBD will keep you informed on which companies have market-leading products and services and red-hot earnings and sales growth rates.

  

Besides IBD, there's a ton of research tools on Investors.com. Use [Screen Center](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?nav=ResearchSC) to find stocks with big earnings estimates, fat profit margins, rising mutual fund ownership, or high return on equity.

  

Investors can also get a quick assessment of a stock's fundamental and technical health with Stock Checkup.

  

Spirit Air made IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and Sector Leaders in early February. When a stock makes its way to multiple lists, investors should pay close attention to its price-and-volume action.

  

The stock had staged a breakout from a cup-with-handle base in October 2013 and was in a second test of its 10-week moving average, providing another buying opportunity. It jumped off the line near 46.42 **(1)** and ran to an all-time high of 63.89 in late March before consolidating gains.

  

In the May 19 edition of IBD, Spirit again made the IBD 50. It was No. 11 and forming a late-stage base. The company was also featured in one of two Inside IBD 50 mini stories. At that time, the discount carrier had quarterly earnings growth of 16% to 126% over the past five quarters. And Spirit racked up 15 straight quarters of double-digit sales growth.

  

Spirit cleared a 63.99 buy point from a consolidation in the week ended June 20. While action was choppy, the stock rallied nearly 16% by September before settling into another consolidation **(2)**.

  

The stock then cleared a 74.10 buy point from a cup base in the week ended Nov. 7. But that breakout failed a few weeks later.

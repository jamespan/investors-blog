Not many big-cap companies can keep growing annual earnings at a double-digit pace. Yet, true to its "Just Do It" slogan, **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) has been doing just that for the better part of the past 14 years. With the exception of single-digit gains in fiscal 2010 and 2007, the athletic shoe powerhouse's per-share earnings growth has ranged from 10% to 28% since 2002.

  

That streak is expected to continue. The Beaverton, Ore.-based company has a five-year earnings growth rate of 13%, with analysts looking for a 16% increase in the current fiscal year, which ends in May, and a 14% jump in fiscal '17.

  

On Tuesday, Stifel raised its [Nike](http://news.investors.com/business/121515-785382-stifel-raises-nke-price-target-fl-finl.htm?ref=HPLNews&t=1450217369493&cachecheck=1) price target to 146 from 135 and maintained a buy rating on the stock, citing strength in running shoes and women's apparel, and rising demand in China and Western Europe.

  

Athletic and so-called "athleisure" trends, which Nike plays right into, remain popular too.

  

Stifel expects Nike to report 87 cents a share on 47.81 billion in sales when it gives Q2 results Tuesday after the close. Consensus estimates are for 85 cents on \$7.8 billion in sales, for increases of 16% and 12%, respectively.

  

That would extend Nike's double-digit per-share earnings growth streak for a sixth straight quarter and mark its best sales gain in four quarters.

  

Deutsche Bank expects Nike to post strong results. In a report Friday, it said Nike "has consistently surpassed expectations this year" despite U.S. retail weakness, slowing in China and foreign-exchange headwinds.

  

**Beating Estimates**

  

The shoemaker has topped earnings estimates so far this year. Analysts thought the shoemaker would end its double-digit profit growth steak in the last reported quarter with a 9% gain, but it reported a 23% EPS jump. 

  

Nike has been a strong stock this year, running up more than 30%. That's far ahead of the S&P 500, which is slightly underwater. The stock is back below a 133.62 flat-base buy point cleared Nov. 25 in light volume.

  

It's a first-stage pattern, because the gain from the prior base's breakout was 13%, short of the 20% minimum needed to qualify for the next-stage base.

  

The low of the prior base also undercut that of an earlier pattern during the Aug. 24 mini flash crash, which reset the base count.

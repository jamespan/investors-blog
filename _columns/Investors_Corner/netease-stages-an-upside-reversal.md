Nearly all Sector Leaders ended lower Wednesday as the market took a beating.

  

But volume was tame in most losing issues. And a couple of stocks managed to buck the trend.

  

**NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) shook off early losses and climbed 0.73 to 61.42. That's good for an all-time closing high. But volume ended 10% below average. Its four prior gains have been in above-average trade.

  

The stock has been vacillating near its 10-week line in recent weeks. It broke out from a 47-week consolidation in late February.

  

**Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) also staged an upside reversal. It added 0.60 to a new closing high of 73.64. Volume was greater than Tuesday's pace, but still came in 9% below average.

  

The stock has fared well amid market volatility in recent weeks. But Monster remains 12% off its April 30 record high. The stock had a huge run-up and reversal that day on reports of a potential buyout offer from **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)).

  

**SXC Health Solutions** ([SXCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SXCI)) erased gains from the past two sessions. It fell 2.60, or 3%, to 88.74. Turnover rose 10% above average and marked the busiest session in more than three weeks.

  

Despite Wednesday's loss, the stock is still in a flat base with a 100.60 buy point.

  

**Coinstar** ([CSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSTR)) backed off after meeting resistance near its 50-day line Tuesday. It lost 1.38 to 60.87, but turnover was 24% below average. The stock snapped a five-week slide last week, but there was no volume behind the move.

  

**SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) shed 1.84, or 4%, to 46.28 in trade that fell 26% below average. It has been hitting new highs in weak volume, which is not a good sign.

  

The stock broke out of a cup base Feb. 3 and is still 37% past a 33.78 buy point.

  

**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) eased just 0.38 to 91.69. The stock lost ground for the third straight session. But Alexion pared the bulk of Wednesday's loss after finding support at its 50-day line.

  

The stock previously found support at its 50-day moving average May 23, which was one day after it cleared a 94.07 early buy point from a flat base. Alexion has yet to close above 94.07.

**Sell Winners Like A Pro:** [Sixth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/611488/201205211612/how-to-sell-winners-like-a-pro.aspx)

Buying is easy; selling is the tougher part, and it determines your bottom line. While most selling techniques involve a stock chart, the P-E (price-to-earnings) expansion method does not.

This method helps investors determine a target selling price. The method is based on IBD's research, which has shown that the P-E ratios of leaders that break out from bases go up by an average of 130% from the buy point.

Yes, the P-E ratio is at the heart of this technique. On Wall Street, the P-E ratio is heavily touted as a simple valuation gauge.

The P-E ratio simply involves dividing the stock's current share price by its latest annual earnings per share.

Stocks with high P-E ratios are considered overvalued and should be sold. And those with low P-E's are touted as being undervalued.

But in reality, some stocks trade at high P-E's for a reason. That's the market's way of saying that the stock is a winner and its profit growth is superior. In contrast, stocks with low P-E's tend to trade at low multiples because of some material weakness.

The P-E expansion technique is only to be used with top-quality stocks breaking out from first-stage bases. So be mindful of where you are in the game. The P-E expansion method can be useful to get a target price on a hot IPO.

In order to find a price target using the P-E expansion method, find the P-E ratio at the time of the breakout. Basically, divide the base's buy point by the latest four quarters of earnings.

Once you have the P-E, multiply it by 2.3 (130%) to get the expanded P-E. Next, look up the company's earnings estimate going two years out. You can find this in MarketSmith. Lastly, multiply the earnings estimate by the expanded P-E ratio to the target price.

In October 1986, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) cleared a 35.60 cup-base buy point **1**. The software firm's latest four quarters of earnings totaled \$1.87, giving it a P-E ratio of 19. Multiply 19 by 2.3 to get an expanded P-E of 44. Microsoft's earnings estimate going two years out was \$2.80 a share.

In order to get a target price, multiply \$2.80 by the expanded P-E ratio of 44. The product is 123.20.

By early May of 2007, Microsoft hit a high of 128.25 **2** before staging a sharp pullback that sent it below its 10-week moving average.

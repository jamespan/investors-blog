  NetEase Snubs China Sell-Off To Advance Big In 2015

NetEase started this year in a test of support at its 10-week moving average, not quite 9% below a late-November high. The Guangzhou, China-based firm, trading its American depositary receipts on the Nasdaq, had gained 26% in the prior 12 months.


2015 would be a much, much better year, but that was less than clear as 2014 rolled to a finish.


**NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) is a home-field favorite on China's gaming scene, ranking a close second to titan **Tencent Holdings** ([TCEHY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCEHY)). NetEase opened the year with its earnings growth slowing to 9% in the fourth quarter of 2014, its slowest rise in more than two years.


Still, the number beat consensus estimates. Revenue grew 39%, marking a third straight quarter of acceleration.


But the stock stumbled. NetEase's December-January pullback became a flat base. The mid-January breakout went nowhere, fizzling just as China's mainland markets began flashing warning signs.


NetEase pulled back 21%, falling more than 8% below the prior buy point and tripping an automatic sell signal. Not a great start to the year.


Turning up from a test of support at its 40-week moving average, the stock shaped a seven-week cup base. It snapped briefly above the 118.57 buy point on April 8, then quickly retreated 6.7% below the correct entry.


Meanwhile, the U.S. market's uptrend was under pressure. Many investors may have been bumped from the stock.


Yet NetEase shares quickly turned up, possibly aided by markets rallying in China.


The U.S. market had slipped into a correction by the time that NetEase reported its Q1 earnings on May 13. But the 20% gain in EPS and 55% revenue surge trounced analyst expectations, sending the stock up 8% in a gap up gain the next day (please see a daily chart). NetEase rallied through May 21 **(1)**, rising 27% above the 118.57 buy point.


Shares consolidated for a few weeks, then rose briefly to a new peak, 31% above its buy point on June 17. But China's markets had become unhinged on June 15 and were in the midst of what would become a 58% rout over the next two months.


NetEase would correct 34% over the same period. Then, as China's markets began their recovery, NetEase launched a powerful rally that is still underway (please see a current chart).


Shares cracked the 154.98 buy point on Nov. 12. The base was more than 50% deep, adding extra risk to the breakout. The stock quickly reversed and slipped 9% below the buy point, tripping another sell rule.


But experienced investors knew the stock's tricks and kept careful watch. NetEase retook its buy point in a seven-day advance. By Dec. 17, shares rose to nearly 20% above the buy point and 88% above where they started the year. They also continue to ride support at the short-term 10-day moving average.

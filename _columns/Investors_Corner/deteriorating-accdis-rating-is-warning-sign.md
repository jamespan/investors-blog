**How To Sell Winners Like A Pro II:** [Third In A Series](http://news.investors.com/special-report/623411-sell-like-a-pro-ii-defense.aspx)

  

Things are bad enough when you see your stock falling. But you know you're knee-deep in something awful when those declines appear with signs that the big-money funds are driving those losses.

  

To make sure you aren't playing against the biggest pockets in town, monitor the Accumulation-Distribution Rating. It runs from a best-possible A to a worst-possible E. No doubt your biggest winners sported an A or B rating when you bought the stock.

  

But owning the stock and watching it rise is no excuse to take your eye off the ball. A declining Accumulation-Distribution Rating would be a clue that the big guys are bailing out.

  

This proprietary grade is best used to filter the market for great stocks to buy. Yet it can also serve as a relatively late sell signal to lock in profits.

  

Sometimes, a deteriorating Acc-Dis Rating presages other problems. Usually, though, by the time the Acc-Dis Rating falls apart — say, to a D or an E — the stock is already having problems. In what way? Maybe it has already sliced below the 10-week moving average. Maybe there's lots of volume on the downside.

  

Remember: You don't ever want to see a gain turn into a loss.

  

Look at fertilizer maker **Potash Corp of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)), a rip-roaring star from 2003 through 2008.

  

Steep gains and clear entries make for the sort of stock you could get your claws into. One of Potash's last bases before it peaked was a square box that broke out in the week ended April 13, 2007 **1**. With many tests of the 10-week line along the way, Potash tore ahead to peak at 241.62 in June 2008 **2**, a staggering 328% past the square box's 56.45 buy point.

  

You're positively giddy.

  

But a daily chart showed that in June 2008, the stock scored several new highs in below-average volume, a big no-no after a big run-up.

  

The stock started to back off. No need to panic. It's been lurching higher and backing off for years. But a closer look reveals that the Acc-Dis Rating had sunk to C+. Even worse, it had fallen as low as D+ a few days earlier.

  

The big funds were exiting. Potash was in trouble.

  

The stock rebounded off the 10-week line in July with solid volume. It moved up some.

  

Maybe you feel better. But Potash sliced decisively below the 10-week line on July 23 **3**, with the Acc-Dis Rating down to D-. Now you also see a head-and-shoulders top emerging and surging downside volume.

  

Hesitant to unload? Now there are no excuses. The stock is falling, and now you know what the big guys are doing — selling.

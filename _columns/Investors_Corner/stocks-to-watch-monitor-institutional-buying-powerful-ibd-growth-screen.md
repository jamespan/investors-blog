With the [stock market in a confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq near or at all-time highs, the case for a year-end rally still holds plenty of water. So it's important to have a ready list of stocks to watch that are catching the attention of institutional investors like fund managers, banks and pension funds.




And there's no better way to do that than with [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) on both the homepage of Investors.com and in the [Stock Lists section](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/). It's a great way to monitor institutional buying — and selling — in the stock market.


The screen of stocks to watch gets continuously updated. It often highlights under-the-radar stocks that are seeing big increases in trading volume.


When a stock that normally trades 1 million shares a day trades that amount in the first couple of hours of trading, the activity will be flagged in Stocks On The Move. Keep in mind that big increases in trading volume aren't the work of retail investors. Instead, it's big investors buying large blocks of shares. And early signs of institutional buying can often turn into more as fund managers build a position.

Keep in mind that volume can trail off in a stock after an early pop, so the most compelling opportunities in [Stocks On The Move](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) will be in stocks that hold strong volume throughout the day.


Stocks To Watch: Auto Retailers
-------------------------------



Perhaps one of the more underappreciated pockets of leadership the current stock market are the auto retailers. Two stocks in this industry group appeared in Stocks On The Move in recent days.


**Sonic Automotive** ([SAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAH)) appeared on Oct. 24 when it gapped out of an early-stage consolidation with a 32.78 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). It also appeared in Weekly Stocks On The Move, found in IBD Weekly on B2.


And **Lithia Motors** ([LAD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAD)) appeared on Oct. 23 when it gapped out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) with a 139.28 entry.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IClad110419-300x161.jpg)Outside of the auto retailers, small cap tech services firm **Perficient** ([PRFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRFT)) appeared in Stocks On The Move on Oct. 29 when shares jumped 5%. The move was good for a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from a [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) with a 39.84 buy point. Volume totaled 1 million shares, well above its 50-day average volume of around 260,000.


And don't forget about data center chip play **Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)), which held the top slot in Stocks On The Move Wednesday.


Shares in the new [Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) soared 19% in huge volume, helped by strong earnings. Volume totaled 5.9 million shares, well above its 50-day average volume of around 950,000.


Headed into Friday's close, Inphi looks poised to gain more than 22% for the week.

**Sell Winners Like A Pro:** [Eighth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/611488/201205211612/how-to-sell-winners-like-a-pro.aspx)

  

Listening is all but a dead art. It was once a keen sense and a critical survival skill, but we now often hear mainly what we want to hear and tune out the rest.

  

Smart investors with an ear to the ground know the sound the market makes when big institutional investors begin to liquidate positions. It starts out faintly in the distance. But it picks up and, as billions of shares trade hands, it begins to rumble.

  

IBD's Market Pulse records those troublesome notes as distribution days rack up against the major indexes. An index that posts a loss of more than 0.2% in higher volume than the prior session earns one distribution day.

  

Five or more stacked against any one index over a short period flags significant institutional selling. It indicates the general market is at risk of some type of correction. That's the cue to shift to offensive selling mode.

  

Offense-style selling says sell on the way up and forgo the final percentage points of a winning run in order to protect existing gains. This often means missing some big upside moves. The payoff is security: It negates the risk of a sharp slide if and when the stock veers into a correction.

  

Alert shareholders of **Riverbed Technology** ([RVBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVBD)) shifted to offensive footing as the market began to rack up distribution days in early March 2011. The IBD 50 stock (then the IBD 100) started the year up 114% from a breakout in July.

  

The stock dropped through its 10-week moving average in heavy trade in late January. It quickly recovered, then broke to new highs. While the stock's sharp bounce off its lows was positive, the action produced a two-weeks-down, two-weeks-up pattern, a key early sell signal **1**.

  

The market was in a confirmed uptrend, a plus. But by Feb. 18 the Nasdaq had gathered four distribution days. The NYSE and S&P 500 showed two days each.

  

Riverbed again dropped to its 10-week moving average and got support **2**. But price action continued to be volatile, another warning. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq was now freighted with five distribution days by Feb. 23. The market uptrend was now under pressure, leaning toward a correction. That, combined with Riverbed's red flags, was enough to put investors on notice.

  

Sellers would have been well within rights to close out positions aggressively, even as the stock posted three gains of more than 5% within a two-week span.

  

Riverbed peaked on March 4. The market fell hard again three days later and shifted to a correction. Riverbed's nail-in-the-coffin sell signal came March 18, when it again punched through its 10-week line in heavy trade **3** and kept falling. The stock is 63% off its March 2011 high.

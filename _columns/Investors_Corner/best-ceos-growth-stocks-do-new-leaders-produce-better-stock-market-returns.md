Can a new chief executive officer lead to a wonderful rebound in a stock? Given time, certainly. But it does not always lead to a stock's outperformance vs. a major average.




Among S&P 500 companies that greeted a new CEO on Jan. 1, 2018, or afterward, the average stock gained 21.6% from Jan. 1 to July 30 this year, according to data from William O'Neil + Co. That slightly beats a 20.2% rise by the S&P 500 itself, dividends excluded.


S&P 500 firms with new CEOs since Jan. 1, 2017, show an average gain of 20.3%. And how about the 36 companies that hired a new chief on Jan. 1 this year or later? Their average return: up 16.1%. Laggards!


Small data set, for sure. But the stats suggest a new CEO may need time to fix problems, deliver on a new strategic plan, or benefit from a sea change in the company's market, industry regulations, or the economy itself.

But simply hiring new management is not enough.


You need a new product or service to reverse a company's fortunes or sustain highflying fundamental growth.


Good managers may change the focus on key products or markets.


Best CEOs And Growth Stocks: One Kind Of Positive Change
--------------------------------------------------------


**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) has had an extraordinary run since its IPO in June 1992. Longtime CEO Howard Schultz reportedly wanted to dramatically boost the number of "Premium Reserve Roastery" mega-shops. But Kevin Johnson, the new CEO in April 2017, steered away from that idea. Instead, his team targets the U.S. and China for long-term growth. Johnson also focuses on serving up new beverages, speeding up service with mobile ordering, and expanding the loyalty program.


The strategy seems to have given Starbucks a big caffeine boost.


In the week ended Nov. 2, 2018, the stock hustled out of a [long saucer](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/) and hit all-time new highs. Over the next two months, Starbucks traded tightly, forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) on top of the prior saucer base. The stock brewed up a 69.08 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), then broke out during a nine-week stretch of gains that began in late December.



On Monday, Starbucks almost hit 100.

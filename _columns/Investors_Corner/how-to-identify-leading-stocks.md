There are high-growth stocks and then there are leading stocks. The difference between the two is greater than it might seem.

In the CAN SLIM investing system that IBD follows, the "L" represents leaders: the leading stocks in an industry or the whole market.

It's not enough to just have earnings and sales growth of 25%, 50% or more. You want high-growth companies that stand out among their peers with well-rounded financial profiles that include solid margins, profit estimates and long-term growth.

For example, of 41 companies in the ethical drugs industry group, 11 had EPS gains of more than 25% in the latest quarter. Of those 11 (excluding thinly traded stocks), just five companies have the long-term profit growth to complement the strong growth of the latest quarter.

**Strength Before A Breakout**

A leading stock also stands out from the rest by the way its share price performs. Leaders make significant price advances, even before they break out of bases.

IBD's Relative Price Strength Rating helps you identify those price leaders. Generally, a leading stock will have an RS Rating of 85 to 99.

An industry group could have more than just one bona fide leader. Choose from the top two or three, but no more.

It's that much better when a company not only tops its industry group in financial performance, but the group itself is a market leader. So, you can also look for stocks in the top 40 of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Part of the entire IBD rankings is published today on Page B2.

An easy way to find the outstanding leaders is to check the Sector Leaders table, today on Page B3. Those are the handful of superior stocks in the IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables. As a group, they've easily outperformed the market.

A leader is not necessarily the biggest company in its market, however. **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are examples of titans in their industries but laggards when it comes to financial growth. Some smaller rivals are performing much better in terms of financials and share prices.

Want an example of a solid leader? **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) was a standout even before it broke out in May of last year, as the chart above shows. The Sector Leader had strong IBD ratings at the start of its move.

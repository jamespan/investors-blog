To make money in stocks, pay more attention to the market than the economy.

In early 2009, investors could have been forgiven for panicking and vowing never again to buy stocks.

Gross domestic product shrank at an 8.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2008, followed by a 6.7% rate of contraction in Q1 2009. More than 2 million people lost their jobs from January through March of that year, and the Nasdaq plunged 53%. There was talk of another Great Depression.

But a strange thing happened on the way to Armageddon.

On March 13, 2009, IBD readers who had checked the Market Pulse box on Page A1 would have found that the NYSE and S&P 500 had followed through **1** (weekly chart is shown), placing the market in a confirmed uptrend and giving the green light to buy stocks.

Those who had ignored the indicators and paid attention to the market reaped the benefits of one of the most powerful stock market rallies in history. From its close at 1426 on March 12, the Nasdaq soared 84% in 10 months, bouncing off its 50-day moving average multiple times to a peak of 2326 on Jan. 11, 2010 **2**.

It's true that economic data can move the market on any given day. Investors should pay close attention to quarterly GDP reports, monthly jobs and other data to gauge the economy's health.

Following news about the major indicators can help investors adjust their market exposure.

But making investment decisions based mainly on economic indicators is no guarantee of investment success and could even be detrimental. One set of indicators could make investors overly pessimistic or excessively optimistic.

First, many indicators lag trends in the economy, describing what was happening in the prior month or quarter. Also, the economy is usually subject to many crosscurrents that sometimes don't immediately show up in the indicators but may influence the markets.

In the example above, President Obama signed a \$787 billion stimulus bill in February 2009. China had also started to crank up government spending. The Federal Reserve had slashed interest rates to near zero, pumping huge amounts of cash into the financial system.

Investors who took note of the market's uptrend in March and started looking for stocks in the IBD 50 would have fared well despite the economic gloom. Similarly, investors who followed IBD's methodology before the 2008 crash were able to get out of the market with gains or with minimal losses.

The key is to find stocks that have hit proper buy points in sound bases and to sell any stock that falls 8% below its buy point.

Also, make sure to sell most winners at 20% to 25% and to never let a big gain become a loss.

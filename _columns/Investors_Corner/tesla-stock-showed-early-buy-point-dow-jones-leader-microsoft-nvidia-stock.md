Cups, double bottoms and flat bases are the main stock chart patterns that set up big price runs. But there are early, more aggressive buy points — like the one seen in Tesla stock in 2020 — you can use to get a head start on the main breakout.




There are a few different ways to find such entries. One easy way is to draw a trend line that connects the highs within the base.


Within a cup with handle, you can draw a [trend line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) that connects the left-side high of the cup with the high of the handle. Meanwhile, you can also draw a trend line that only connects the highs within the handle portion of a cup-with-handle base.


Elsewhere, previous areas of resistance can also create earlier buying opportunities. These are price levels where bulls have been frustrated, but when the resistance is finally breached, the stock can resume its upward trend.

Additional Risks
----------------


Remember, the risk-optimal buy point is the correct buy point based on the chart pattern — not the cheapest price — so these aggressive entries carry more risk. For a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), for example, the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) is the highest price in the handle.


IBD admonishes investors to buy fewer shares at alternative buy points to mitigate the additional risk. As usual, be sure to cut your losses short if the stock trade starts to head south. You can use the same [7% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) as you do with normal buy points, or you could also cut them a bit earlier if the stock is clearly not behaving as expected.


Tesla Stock Shows An Early Buy Point
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ICtsla021521-300x161.jpg)During the autumn of 2020, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was basing in an awkward cup with handle, which showed a conventional buy point at 466. Using a trend line **(1)** that connected the high of Oct. 14 with the high on Nov. 9, an aggressive entry emerged around 450 **(2).**


The 450 early entry was about 3.5% lower than the 466 buy point **(3)**.


Tesla stock broke past the early entry on Nov. 17, 2020. One day later, the stock broke out past the conventional entry at 466.


On Jan. 25, 2021, Tesla stock hit a record high at 900.40 (prior to a 3-for-1 stock split), climbing as much as 93% past the 466 entry. Meanwhile, [the Jan. 8 IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tesla-stock-flashes-climax-top-signals/) column signaled that Tesla was flashing several signs of a climax top amid a nearly vertical run. Indeed, Tesla began a long correction in February 2021.


Microsoft's Multiple Entries
----------------------------


**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) flashed multiple alternative buy points in its first base since the coronavirus stock market crash.


On April 14, 2020, shares jumped above a 170 early entry, in a way-too-short handle. Shares topped the "normal" buy point, a double bottom's 175 entry on April 16. In another alternative buy point, the software giant cleared a higher handle with an entry at 180. All three buy points produced gains.

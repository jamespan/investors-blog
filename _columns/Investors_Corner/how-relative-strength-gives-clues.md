  How Relative Strength Lines Can Tip Off A Big Winner

To make the playoffs, a baseball team doesn't need to win a certain number of games, it just needs to be better than the rest of the teams in its division. Similarly, a stock's strength during a correction only needs to be relatively acceptable. For example, what if a leading growth stock goes down 15% while the general market averages fall 25%? That's strength, and an easy way to spot it is to learn to read the relative strength line on IBD Charts.

  

The RS line is the squiggly blue line found under the stock's price bars. The line plots the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500, a benchmark for the broad market. When the line is trending higher you know the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. Conversely, when the line is trending lower the stock is underperforming the benchmark index.

  

When a stock breaks out from a base, savvy investors like to see the RS line at or near new highs to confirm the strength of the stock. Even more bullish is when the RS line jumps to new highs before the stock breaks out.

  

When the RS line hits new-high ground before the actual shares hit a new high, the stock often follows.

  

To assess the technical strength of a stock, the RS line is a technical tool to use along with moving-average lines; the price and volume movement; the Accumulation/Distribution Rating; and the up/down volume ratio.

  

It's different than IBD's proprietary Relative Price Strength Rating, which runs a scale from 1 to 99 and compares all stocks based on 12-month price performance. Used together, these two measures give a good picture of how strong a stock is compared to other investment candidates in the stock market.

  

The steeper the upslope of the RS line the stronger the outperformance. A base breakout from a stock with a declining RS line is weaker and more likely to fail. Subscribers to MarketSmith can use the screening tool to screen for stocks whose RS lines are hitting new highs, which can often be good watch-list candidates.

  

The relative strength line would have helped you spot discount warehouse **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) as it broke out from a cup-with-handle pattern in the early 1990s.

  

The base corrected 38%, which is a little deeper than many successful patterns, but was sound â€” relative to the correction in the general market at the time.

  

The stock first cleared a short handle, which could only be seen on a daily chart, on Nov. 27. The relative strength line gave a tip-off to the power of the stock by moving to a new high on Nov. 12 **(1)**, two weeks before the breakout.

  

Other elements in the base helped confirm the strong technical picture that the RS line was painting. Within the base, tight weekly closes, support weeks and heavy volume advances pointed to institutional accumulation. A run of seven straight weekly gains up the right side of the base was also a positive sign.

  

Costco offered an additional high-handle buy point on Jan. 16, 1991, past 49.60. The RS line had made a series of new highs **(2)** in the weeks prior to this breakout as well.

  

The stock continued to outperform and shares nearly tripled from the first buy point over the next 14 months **(3)**.

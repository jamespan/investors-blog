  Things To Keep In Mind For ETFs And CAN SLIM

While an ETF explosion in recent years has provided new opportunities for retail investors and professionals, traders following IBD's CAN SLIM strategy need to keep a few things in mind.


Yes, exchange traded funds offer a relatively easy way to get exposure to commodities, foreign markets and many other areas â€” from smartphone companies to Brazil's currency.


But remember that you can't apply all of the concepts in CAN SLIM to ETFs.


It certainly makes sense to use the market-timing aspects of the CAN SLIM strategy when trading some ETFs.


Some readers say they have profited from using IBD's market outlook as they buy and sell a straightforward ETF that tracks a key index, such as the **SPDR S&P 500** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) or the **PowerShares QQQ Trust** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) (which follows the Nasdaq 100, an index of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange).


These readers buy when a follow-through day signals a new rally attempt, switching IBD's outlook to "confirmed uptrend." They sell when distribution days pile up and the outlook downshifts to "market in correction."


You might be tempted to use IBD's approach to technical analysis when you trade ETFs, since they can sketch and break out of chart patterns in a similar fashion as growth stocks. But many ETFs tend to be a collection of stocks, so they are bound to include laggards. These names would place a heavy drag on such moves.


It also gets complicated if you try to apply CAN SLIM to some other areas for ETFs, such as quarterly gains in profit.


You might see some figures in that department for an ETF, but you shouldn't give them the weight that you would with a growth stock.


**Too Many Rabbits?**


And CAN SLIM investors also ought to think about opportunity costs as they ponder ETFs.


In other words, the time that you spend researching and analyzing ETFs could take away from the time that you have for looking for promising growth stocks.


You should ask yourself: Will you score bigger profits with your ETF investments than you would with a CAN SLIM stock?


You just might manage to do that, but also keep in mind what William J. O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has said in his best-seller "How to Make Money in Stocks."


"To be perfectly honest, I'm not a big fan of exchange traded funds because I think you can make more money by focusing on the market leaders," O'Neil wrote in his book, referring to stocks that are leading the market. "But because ETFs had become so wildly popular with not only individual investors but also asset managers, (IBD) started covering ETFs in February 2006."


IBD continues to provide regular coverage of ETFs. The articles look at everything from ETFs that have just been created to those that are making big moves because of the latest headlines around the world.


Recent articles have covered ETFs tied to gold, natural gas, Greece, airlines and homebuilders. There also have been stories about ETFs linked to cotton, cocoa and even what hedge funds are buying.

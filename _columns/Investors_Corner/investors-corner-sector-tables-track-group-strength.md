Investing can be a time-consuming and intensive process. IBD consistently strives to make things easier for investors.

In February 2008, the standard, old-school, alphabetically ordered stock tables were revamped to make them more useful.

The NYSE and Nasdaq Research Tables, which start today on Page B3, combined the stocks from both main exchanges into one list. Each stock goes into one of 33 sectors, and the latter are ranked by relative performance. The strongest sector is listed first, the weakest last. Stocks priced below 10 a share are omitted from the tables.

Just below the headings of some sectors, you'll find a few stocks with extraordinary fundamentals and price performance heading a sector's listings. These highlighted issues are sector leaders. This special feature helps you identify the best stocks in each sector. Not every sector will have such highlighted names, though.

It's critical to understand the impact that sector performance has on the chances a growth stock will produce excellent returns. IBD research has found that almost half of a stock's price performance can be tied to its broad sector and its specific industry group.

Like schools of fish, stocks tend to move in groups. But not all groups of stocks move up at the same rate. There's a reason why sometimes chipmakers are leading the market, while solar panel makers are lagging. Innovative new technology, demand for supplementary or complementary products and services, regulatory changes, price increases and material shortages can all affect a sector.

Investors should focus on top-rated stocks from the best sectors. But it's also a good idea to pay attention to sectors climbing or falling in the listings.

At the start of the final quarter of 2010, agriculture, leisure, computer and Internet were among the top sectors. Rising grain prices and a buyout offer for **Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) boosted not only fertilizer producers, but farming equipment makers as well.

In late November, agriculture slipped, while computer and Internet moved ahead. Gains in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **EZchip Semiconductor** ([EZCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EZCH)) boosted the computer sector. **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) helped the Internet sector.

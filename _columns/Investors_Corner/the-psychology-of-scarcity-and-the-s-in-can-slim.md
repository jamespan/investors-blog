If necessity is the mother of invention, then maybe it’s the uncle of price. If you need something and have trouble getting it, you are generally willing to pay more.


That is how the floor of a stock exchange works, with buyers bidding and sellers trying to coax the best price possible. When a stock is in short supply and multiple buyers want it, prices get bid up and the stock’s chart action heads north.


What would make a stock’s supply run short?


That is the subject of the S in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749): weighing the supply of and demand for shares. And it is a key factor in setting the stage for a leading stock’s price rally.


There are several ways to measure the supply of a company’s stock. The first is total shares outstanding. This is used to calculate market capitalization and earnings per share. The important number for price action is a stock’s float. The second is a company's float, or total shares outstanding minus the number of shares closely held by management or other inside shareholders. These closely held shares rarely, if ever, make it to the trading floor.


Differences between shares outstanding and float can vary widely. **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) has total shares outstanding of 1.478 billion and a float of 1.419 billion, a difference of 59 million shares. **Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) (which trades American Depositary Receipts) shows total ADRs outstanding of 2.446 billion and a float of 929 million -- a 1.5-billion-share differential. But **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) counts 50 million shares outstanding and a float of 49 million.


The third gauge is average trading volume (bought and sold each day) over the past 50 sessions. Seek a minimum of more than 400,000 to 500,000 shares. High-priced stocks may show a smaller average volume and still be highly liquid.


This may seem counter-intuitive. If a tight supply drives up prices, why not go for stocks that have small floats and are thinly traded? The problem: Thinly traded stocks tend to be volatile, typically rising fast and steep when they rally, and falling especially hard when they lose. Thinly traded stocks generally form erratic bases, characterized by wide daily or weekly price swings. They can be easily manipulated by a single large investor, driving prices up and taking profits according to their own needs, and fracturing the group behavior that drives base patterns and breakouts.


A large float and a healthy current of daily volume makes it much less likely one or two brokerage shops can manipulate a stock. Basing patterns track a stock in which share supply gradually tightens as institutional players build positions at comparatively low prices.


When the supply becomes constrained due to large-volume buying and a lack of willing sellers, a stock surges as investors crowd in for the rally that will hopefully follow.

Some investing terms sound simple, but deserve a little detailed explanation. "Industry group" is a good example.

Homebuilders, online retailers, chipmakers and biotech medicine developers are all examples of industry groups. These are collections of companies that tend to have somewhat related products and/or address similar markets.

Overly simplistic, maybe. But an industry group usually represents a segment of the economy. When large flows of investor capital move into that portion of the economy, it typically drives that group of stocks higher vs. others in **[IBD's industry group rankings](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-sep-07-2016/)**.

Rankings are based on a number of factors, predominantly six-month price performance. If you watch the IBD's industry group rankings closely enough, catch the move early, and identify the strongest stocks in the industry, you have a clear advantage in taking action near the onset of an industry rally.

The majority of leading stocks generally rise from leading industries. IBD research shows that 37% of a leading stock's price movement is directly tied to the performance of the stock's industry group. Another 12% owes to the strength of the overall sector. (A sector is a collection of related industry groups. IBD collects its 197 groups into 33 sectors, which it tracks and ranks in its Smart NYSE & Nasdaq Tables*.*)

Overall, this means nearly 50% of a leading stock's price performance is linked to its industry and its sector. Learning to track those sources of strength is simple, but it requires a little practice.

You start with IBD's Industry Sub-Group Rankings Table. This online resource, reached by clicking Stock Lists, then IBD Data Tables at the top of the Investors.com home page, tracks industry rankings. The table also shows where each group ranked three weeks ago and six weeks ago. These rankings are also found in the IBD Weekly print publication.

Look for high-ranking groups that are accelerating in the rankings over the past three and six-week periods. You'd like a group Composite Rating above 85.

Once you zero in on an industry, the most complete way to find and sort specific companies within the group is using IBD's **[MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen&src=A012BF2)**. This powerful screening and research tool shows all the stocks in every industry group, allowing the user to break them out by a long list of factors including earnings or price performance, Accumulation/Distribution Rating or SMR Rating from IBD.

Another avenue is to go to IBD's **[New America](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-new-america/)** or **[Industry Snapshot](https://www.investors.com/category/research/industry-snapshot/)** offerings at Investors.com. These provide in-depth views into leading stocks and industries in motion, giving names of not only stocks in a particularly industry group, but also a sense of the markets, products and innovations driving investor interest in that specific area of the economy.

IBD's **[Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-acacia-communications-acia.aspx)** gives additional insight from an industry group perspective. The checkup lists the top five stocks in each industry group, sorted by all of IBD's proprietary ratings: Composite, EPS, Relative Strength, SMR or Accumulation/Distribution.

Learning to track and benefit big-money trends is one of the most powerful ways for individual investors to success in the stock market._

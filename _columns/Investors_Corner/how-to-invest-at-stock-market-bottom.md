"Major buying points often occur without a full scale actual business depression. At such times the fear of a depression exists." (G. Loeb, "The Battle for Investment Survival")

  

"Through the years, I've found that when you get a follow-through, the vast majority of investors simply do not believe it's for real. They are scared to death. They're too busy licking their wounds from a downtrend that's been so bad and news that's so negative that they're conditioned to doubt and be afraid of every rally." (William O'Neil, "The Successful Investor")

  

"I feel my success comes from my love of the markets. I am not a casual trader. It is my life. I have a passion for trading." (Ed Seykota, "Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders")

  

Fear is good for mankind's survival.

  

Kids learn it's not a good idea to put a hand in the fire. Smart investors cut losses at 8% or less; the chance of taking a much bigger hit to our portfolio always exists.

  

But when it's time to buy stocks, it's often when fear fills the air like a thick fog.

  

The best time to buy great stocks is in the days and weeks after the market has turned. That's when a strong follow-through takes place and fast-growing companies bust out of sound price consolidations, or bases, to new highs.

  

As true market leaders build their gains and climb the wall of worry, the media often will bombard you with negative opinions, sour headlines and bad news.

  

Forgetaboutit! A bull market discounts all of that. It looks far ahead.

  

On Sept. 1, 2010, the Nasdaq vaulted 3% in heavier volume **1**. This follow-through gave IBD readers the signal to seek highly rated stocks breaking out of well-formed bases and running to new highs in big volume.

  

As the accompanying chart shows, some news headlines relayed gloom and doom. But the Nasdaq went on to rally 22% through the end of 2010. Market leaders gained 20% to 200%.

  

When the sounds of doubt and fear echo inside your head, remember Seykota's quote. Your passion for investing and desire to succeed can extinguish any raging fear.

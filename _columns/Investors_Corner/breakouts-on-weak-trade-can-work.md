  Why Some Low-Volume Breakouts Can Still Work

In whatever you do, sometimes conditions don't go according to plan. Rain or other bad weather can kill your plans for a weekend picnic or stop you from going out on a cross-country bike ride.


In the CAN SLIM investing method, one key thing that IBD always stresses is before you invest in stocks, they should have big volume breaking out of bases.


While heavy volume is the ideal situation, it doesn't always come just when an excellent stock takes out the buy point in a well-constructed base.


**Exceptions Can Occur**


While a lot of fundamental, technical and market factors should be in place before you buy a stock, it's rare that every single aspect is perfect before the stock proves to be a good breakout. But you definitely want to see far more positives than failing factors.


Regarding volume, daily turnover should be at least 40% to 50% above average when a stock clears a buy point in a base. IBD computes a stock's average over the past 50 trading sessions. In the data tables, the "Volume Percentage Change" figure reflects the change in the prior day's volume vs. its 50-day average.


Big turnover signals that professionals such as mutual funds and hedge funds are buying shares. So at a critical point such as a breakout, a big volume spike (along with a healthy price gain) is the best evidence of big turnover. The higher the volume, the bigger the conviction in a move.


Sometimes, though, trade will rise only slightly — not quite 40% or more — above average. Other times, volume may be well below typical levels.


It's not an automatic game over, and it's not a sell signal, either. Heavy volume can come a few days later to validate a breakout. It can happen when a stock takes out a base's buy point before an earnings report.


In other cases, overall market volume may be light, affecting the level of turnover among emerging market leaders.


If a stock has solid leadership qualities, such as high top- and bottom-line growth, and showed increasing accumulation before staging a low-volume breakout, you may want to give it more leeway.


While strong volume is the best evidence of institutional buying, price is the final arbiter.


Remember: Always cut losses if a stock falls 7% or 8% below your buy point. This is key whether a breakout occurs in overwhelming or underwhelming turnover.


Market leader **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) staged a breakout in weak turnover during late June but has gone on to post nice gains.


On June 30, the biotech passed an 83.80 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Trade ended 14% below average that day **(1)**, and the stock closed below 83.80, down 4 cents at 82.91, both of which are uninspiring. But volume may have been slow ahead of the July 4 holiday.


In the first quarter, Gilead's profit jumped 208%, the biggest jump in years, on a 97% rise in revenue to \$5 billion.


The stock rose 6% from July 1 through 3. Trade was only modestly above average July **(2)**. Big volume didn't come in until July 23 2. By that time, the stock had already climbed 8% past the 83.80 trigger. Gilead hit the 20% profit-taking zone Aug. 18 **(3)**.

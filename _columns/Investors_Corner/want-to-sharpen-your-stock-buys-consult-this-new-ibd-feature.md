Simplify, simplify, simplify. It's the mantra of some business gurus. It also may make your quest for stock market profits in the best growth stocks such as Amazon.com more fun and pleasant.




During a conversation years ago, William O'Neil showed one of his favorite books, a published diary and observations of Thomas Edison. O'Neil turned to a page noting Edison's prediction of what education would be like in the future.


It would involve motion pictures, including sound. Edison thought the future of education would be video.


Did Edison predict the TED and TEDx talks?


O'Neil's point: Make something simpler to take in and learn, and it will grow high in demand. That's been the IBD chairman's philosophy ever since he launched Investor's Daily (the old name of the newspaper) in April 1984.


Making Money In Growth Stocks: A Guiding Principle
--------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ICamzn051517-166x300.png)


Simplify the complex game of making money in stocks by picking the very best companies. Stick with those with excellent ratings. Buy only the No. 1 company in its field. Be aggressive at the beginning of a new bull market. Move to the sidelines awash in cash when the market seas get rough.


The [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/) feature, refreshed every Monday at Investors.com, is one of the more recent efforts by IBD to help stock pickers. Subscribers to Investors.com can access it by going to [Stock Lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) on the homepage of IBD's website.


For months, the market has been in a stable uptrend. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have posted new highs. So this column has been able to focus on liquid stocks with excellent proprietary ratings that have formed solid bases.


The Jan. 17, 2017, column featured **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) just as the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant was finishing a solid base. Amazon created a cup pattern with a 847.31 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), but it also [sculpted a fine handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) from Jan. 27 to Feb. 6, giving a slightly lower ideal entry at 843.94.


The overall decline was mild. Plus the handle slanted lower along the lows, a perfect final shakeout.


Amazon cleared the handle slowly in mid-February. Large volume was absent at first, but then came in strongly in March.



The Nasdaq megacap now trades near 1,800, less than 13% below an all-time peak of 2,050. Since July of 2019, Amazon has been fashioning a [saucer-style pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/).


The 2017 Breakout By Adobe
--------------------------


The same column highlighted **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) with a note that the specialist in digital marketing and graphics software could form a handle with a 109.15 buy point.



Adobe fell just one session short of the minimum five days for a handle. But the [IBD Big Cap 20 member](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) still broke out nicely past a 111.19 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a shallow three-month cup.


Adobe went on to rally more than 160%.


It now trades currently near 307 and it too is forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Of course, if you thoroughly know the theory behind IBD's [CAN SLIM stock selection system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), you'll do much better in practice. That's the purpose of the archive of stories at [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/).

As the old saying goes, "Everything should be in moderation." Yes, it is OK to eat greasy bacon or indulge in slice after slice of cheesecake once in a while. But too much can become a problem.


In the stock market, companies with hot products and services or savvy management often get their time on the TV screen, in flashy magazines or touted on different websites. Some coverage is fine, as this gets the word out and encourages investors to learn about the company's offerings and prospects, making for more potential shareholders.


But too much media attention can be a sell signal, especially if it coincides with [climax tops](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/612599-how-to-recognize-climax-top.htm) or other topping action in a stock. At the very least, it can be a warning to not get complacent.


When just about every magazine and TV station are touting the greatness of a company's game-changing product or how much its stock has run up, or perhaps when a firm's CEO smiling face gets on the cover of a publication, it's time to get defensive. Hunt for key sell signals by using daily and weekly stock charts.


There can be lofty levels of media attention on the entire stock market as well. If every guest on news programs is forecasting Dow 100K, it's time to get cautious. Too much media attention suggests that everyone who wants to be in the market or in an individual stock is already in. There are no investors left to buy, which becomes a dangerous situation. Good times are likely over.


**Unfortunate Covers**


Meg Whitman, former chief executive of **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), graced the cover of Fortune on Oct. 18, 2004. By the time that happened, eBay stock has already nearly quadrupled from a breakout two years earlier. The online auction giant topped in December 2004 and was nearly cut in half over the next four months.


More recently, **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) had a monster run since hitting a low of 2.17 in March 2009. From June to September 2010, the yoga and athletic clothing retailer formed a double-bottom base. A breakout past a 21.73 entry, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in July 2011, led to a 273% gain to an 81.09 peak in May 2012 **(1)**.


In March, two months earlier, analysts on CNBC continued to pound the table on the stock. Yet Lululemon began sliding sharply below its 10-week moving average and spent a year moving sideways. The stock touched a new high in early May of this year **(2)**, but good times didn't last.

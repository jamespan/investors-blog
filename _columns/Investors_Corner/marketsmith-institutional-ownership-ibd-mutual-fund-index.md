You've analyzed a company's impressive fundamentals. You've studied its chart. And you understand why the company's prospects are excellent. Before you push the buy button, you should check one more thing: the quality of institutional sponsorship in the stock.

  

[MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com/), a charting service and sister company of IBD, taps into a powerful database that will let you see important details regarding which and how many mutual funds own shares in a particular stock.

  

The first place to look is the weekly chart and the data blocks on the left side. Look for the block that reveals the number of funds that have owned the company over the past four quarters. At a glance, you can see if the trend is rising or falling.

  

Generally, rising fund sponsorship is positive, because you need strong institutional buying to fuel a stock's big rise after it breaks out of a proper base.

  

You can get a more detailed picture of mutual fund ownership by clicking on the "Related Information" tab on the right side, then the "Ownership" tab. There you can see the percentage of funds that own a firm and the number of funds that have owned shares over the past several quarters.

  

By clicking on the "Show Fund Ownership" button near the bottom, you can get a list of the funds that own it.

  

As you scan the list, seek out names of top funds with outstanding long-term track records. If none are there, their absence could raise a red flag. You can assume that top fund managers and the analysts who work for them have already put the company under a microscope by talking to customers, suppliers and management. If all of them have passed on the stock, maybe you should, too.

  

In IBD, go to the "What's The Market Trend?" page (today on B2) and check out the IBD Mutual Fund Index at the bottom. It's a list of the 20 top funds, handpicked by IBD founder and chairman William O'Neil. These funds are run by managers O'Neil considers some of the very best stock pickers in the business.

  

Now, create a stock list in MarketSmith with the tickers for those 20 funds. MarketSmith allows users to flag a fund. Put flags next to each ticker.

  

When you call up a company, you can create a list of all the funds that own it. You can sort by IBD's proprietary ratings to get the funds with A+ and A ratings. A fund's three-year performance must be in the top 5% to get an A+ and top 10% to get an A.

  

You can then sort by whether or not a fund has a flag and highlight the funds with the best long-term managers.

  

Let's take a look at **Level 3 Communications** ([LVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVLT)). It has a weak Composite Rating of 74, but its RS Rating is climbing, now at 89. The number of funds has increased in each of the last seven quarters to 530.

  

Now, look at the list of funds owning it. There are 19 A+ funds and 64 A funds. Be careful to scan the list of funds. Some might be sector, country or index funds, which own a stock because of where or what it is rather than the company's prospects.

  

Then, sort by funds that you have flagged.

  

One flagged fund appears at the top of the list: Legg Mason Opportunity Trust Fund .

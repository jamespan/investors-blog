Knowing the strength of a stock's industry group is vital to investing. That's why IBD publishes data and related features every day to measure this key factor.

The Industry Themes column, the daily ranking of 197 industry groups, and IBD's Research Tables show readers which industries and sectors are driving the gains like a locomotive and which ones are following like a caboose.

It may also be worth a minute or two of your time to check out the "Top 10 Fidelity Industry Funds Since Jan. 1, 2011" table, also found on the How's The Market? page.

Pay particular attention to the top several sectors on the list and those making solid gains.

The table helps you see where the institutional dollars are flowing. It helps you focus on stocks with the potential to make big gains. It may also enhance your market vision as you sift through stocks profiled in features such as IBD 50, Stocks On The Move, Stock Spotlight, Industry Spotlight and Industry Themes.

Fidelity, with decades of experience and expertise in the investment business as one of the largest money managers in the world, sells more than 40 separate sector funds, ranging from Health Care to IT Services to Retailing.

Why care what large funds are doing? They spend weeks, even months, building long positions in certain stocks. Their continuous buying has a dramatic effect on the returns of leading sectors as well.

Let's see what this table showed when the market followed through on Sept. 1, 2010. The Nasdaq, which jumped 3% on Day 4 of a new rally, gained 30% over the next five months.

As the table shows, Fidelity's top industry fund was gold, with a year-to-date gain of 16%. Next came transportation (up 15%), air transport (+11%) and Leisure (+10%).

Armed with this knowledge, you might have paid even more attention to companies in these sectors that made the IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and other features.

A week before the Sept. 1 follow-through, **Silver Wheaton** ([SLW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLW)) charged out of a two-month base and rallied 94% in just three months.

The mining products investor ranked No. 20 in the IBD 100 (the predecessor to the IBD 50) on Sept. 7, just days after the Sept. 1 follow-through. When the stock pulled back to its 10-week moving average in late October, it was a ripe time to buy shares.

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), the No. 1 DVD rental firm, resumed its breakout past a 124.10 buy point Sept. 1 after briefly pulling back. It was No. 1 in the IBD 100 on Sept. 7, 2010. The stock ran to 304 before sliding.

By the end of 2010, Fidelity's automotive, transportation, leisure and gold sector funds topped their peers with gains of 35% to 46%. But the best stocks in these sectors performed even better.

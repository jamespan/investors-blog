Let's say the market is in a serious funk. It's been in a downtrend for months in either a serious correction or even a bear market. You've taken your profits from the previous rally and are safely on the sidelines.

  

The temptation at this point is to forget about the stock market, but that would be a mistake.

  

Why? When the market finally turns up, you'll be caught off guard.

  

At the market bottom, the public commentary will be relentlessly negative.

  

Most seers and many individual and professional investors will be convinced the market is headed lower.

  

The market has also had several fake-out rallies along the way; you say to yourself that the most recent one looks no different.

  

That's why you have to keep watching the market.

  

Rallies begin when least expected.

  

**What To Do**

  

Take a look at the major indexes each day, analyzing the price and volume action.

  

Read IBD's [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) column, which analyzes the day's action from IBD's uniquely objective, fact-based perspective. Analyze the charts of major indexes on the What's The Market Trend? page (today on B2).

  

Check out the market columns in the B section, scanning the minicharts for stocks that might be setting up in bases.

  

When you spot one, do a little research.

  

Read up on stories in IBD's archives and visit the company's website. Put the ticker into [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) and see if it passes most of the CAN SLIM criteria.

  

Also, analyze the stock's daily and weekly charts. Then put it on a watch list and check its chart on a daily basis.

  

If you subscribe to MarketSmith, the online chart and screening service that is a sister company of IBD, run screens on a daily and weekly basis, trying to find emerging leadership. The IBD 50 is a good start.

  

The leaders in the next rally will likely be different from those in the last. You might find numerous stocks setting up that you've never heard of. You'll be much more comfortable buying them if you understand them.

  

One caveat: Avoid the temptation of buying before the market turns.

  

Wait for a follow-through day and wade in slowly, one stock at a time.

  

**Darkest Before Dawn Of Breakouts**

  

Take the example of **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) in late 2002. The period from 2000 to early 2003 was brutal. It was one of history's worst bear markets. The Nasdaq lost 78%.

  

But throughout 2002, eBay moved sideways. Institutional investors who understood the promise of the online marketplace that was just coming of age were quietly building positions.

  

The stock's outperformance can be seen in the rising [relative strength line](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/774122-how-relative-strength-gives-clues.htm) **(1)** that preceded the stock to a new high.

  

EBay shot past a double-bottom base buy point of 62.09 on Oct. 21, 2002. Volume was 71% above average. The market volatility wasn't finished when eBay broke out, so a disengaged investor missed the opportunity of the year. At the breakout, eBay had a Composite Rating of 97, an EPS Rating of 98, a Relative Price Strength Rating of 85 and an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+. By July 2004, eBay had soared 203%.

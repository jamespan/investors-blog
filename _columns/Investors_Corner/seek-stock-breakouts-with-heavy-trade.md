**How To Spot A Fine Chart:** [Ninth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/609681/201204301707/how-to-spot-a-fine-chart.aspx)

  

Every day, people or companies tell bald-faced lies or, at the very least, make what you might call "strategic misrepresentations."

  

It can be frustrating, but there are still some things in this world that are pretty reliable. In investing, that includes the volume bars on stock charts.

  

They tell you when there's a real rush for the exits. On the flip side, they show you when there's truly strong interest in a stock.

  

A key time to look for big volume is when a stock tries to break out from a base, a period of price consolidation.

  

Seeing heavy turnover in a breakout from a base is like having a nice moment of truth.

  

In this 10-part series of columns, "How to Spot a Fine Chart," we've covered topics like upside reversals and tight closes in a pattern. It's important to look for all of these elements.

  

Then, at the end of the base-building effort, you also want to see strong volume during a move past a buy point. That means turnover that's 40% or more above the stock's daily average daily over the past 50 days.

  

**Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) provided a good example of a stock attracting heavy turnover with its breakout in February 2011.

  

The restaurant chain made its move after etching a long base that began in April 2010.

  

It's probably best to view the pattern as a cup-with-handle structure. The buy point was at 50.60 **1**, which you get by adding 10 cents to the peak in the handle.

  

Weekly turnover was at its biggest levels in months **2** and more than double its weekly average as Buffalo Wild Wings moved past 50.60. This was during the week ended Feb. 11, 2011.

  

If you look at a daily chart, note that turnover also was strong on the actual breakout day, Feb. 9.

  

Beyond volume, it's also encouraging to see a decisive gain in price with any breakout. Buffalo Wild Wings certainly had that. The stock advanced 13% for the week ended Feb. 11 **3**.

  

Buffalo Wild Wings has continued to act relatively well since its February 2011 breakout. The profit is more than 60% for anyone who bought around 50.60.

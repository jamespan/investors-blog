  Aggressive Shakeout + 3 Buy Point Offers Rare Cushion

Pinpointing early buy points in base patterns is not really about getting in early in order to make those two or three extra points of profit. It's really about building more cushion into your position.


That extra cushion helps when a stock pulls back to test support or retest a buy point, and a stock often does such things. You are less likely to see your buy point undercut by 7% to 8%, the sell rule that automatically ejects you from the stock.


An early buy point is risky, and the stock may fall apart and never break out. But if the stock breaks out, early buyers have the luxury of a shock absorber that helps keep them in the stock.


This is why the pioneering investor Jesse Livermore (1877-1940) ID'd and named the "shakeout + 3" technique. The pattern can provide alert investors an early side door into a double-bottom pattern.


The setup requires two lows: the second low cutting below the first. It also requires a high point in the middle, creating something like a "W."


A typical double-bottom buy point would be the high of the center point, plus a dime. If the base forms a handle, then it's a dime above the handle's left-side high. In a shakeout + 3 entry, just add 3 points (dollars) to that left-side low and that's your buy point. In higher-priced stocks, you might want to add 5 or even 10 points, rather than 3.


If adding three points puts you very near or above the standard buy point of a double-bottom, the trick doesn't do you any good.


But if the corrections are deep, it could put you into the stock well ahead of the standard buy point. Shakeout + 3 winners in the past include **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)) after an April 2013 breakout and, the classic example, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), which snapped past its buy point in October 1990.


**Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) went public in July 2004. At the end of August 2005, the Brazilian carrier slipped into a 10-week, double-dip consolidation.


The first lobe of the pattern dipped to 30.26 (the chart shows prices adjusted for a 2-for-1 split), then rose to a center point before slipping to a second, deeper bottom. This put the shakeout + 3 buy point at 33.26, nearly 5% below the 34.95 standard entry.


Gol cleared the early buy point on Oct. 11 **1**, then cleared the standard buy point in heavy trade on Oct. 14. Gol ran to a May 2006 peak, up 148% from the early entry, and up 136% above the standard double-bottom buy point.

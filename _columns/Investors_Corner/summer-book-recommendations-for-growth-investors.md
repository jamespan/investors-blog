Are you looking for a new book to devour after finishing that third or fourth detective novel?


Before summer melts into fall, why not take up an investing-related book while you take in the rays? Savvy investors keep reading and learning. The reason is simple: The economy changes, the market changes, the stock leaders change.


You could read one or two investment classics, or reread them. It's always useful to refresh yourself with the wisdom and experiences of a legendary trader.


"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" details the experience of Jesse Livermore during his roller-coaster ride in stocks and commodities.


"How I Made \$2,000,000 in the Stock Market" shares how a ballroom dancer learned the importance of buying stocks only when they went up. Gerald Loeb's "The Battle for Investment Survival" and Peter Lynch's "One Up on Wall Street" hold nuggets of wisdom in stock picking, research and portfolio management.


The first chapter of the latest edition of "How to Make Money in Stocks" showcases 100 of the best winners going back to the 1880s. You'll see Richmond & Danville, which created America's first cup-with-handle chart.


Also consider reading a book that sheds light on how Wall Street works, or what's going on in a particular industry. Others explain why some economic regions offer growth opportunities. Here are a few quotes from the latest reads:


"One of the toughest things an analyst has to do is admit a mistake. If you're wrong only 45 percent of the time, you're one of the best."


This quote from Mike Mayo's "Exile on Wall Street" succinctly explains how analysts at Wall Street banks think and operate.


Mayo, a veteran banking analyst, was the sole analyst to testify before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee in 2002 on conflicts of interest on Wall Street.


"The problem with bubbles is a problem in dealing with the universal behavior of people, not the behavior of the abstract entities called markets."


This quote from "Finance and the Good Society" by Yale professor Robert Shiller rightly points out that bubble markets will continue to come and go.


"There is a perception, rightly or wrongly, that Vietnam is the next China, a booming market soaking up resources and consumer goods, buying banking services and cell phones with gusto."


In "World Right Side Up," Christopher Mayer gives reader a journey of trends and investing ideas across six continents.

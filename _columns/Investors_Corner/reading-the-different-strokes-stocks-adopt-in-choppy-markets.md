Well-trained, open-water swimmers learn to alter their techniques in order to deal with rough conditions. This means, among other things, sacrificing some symmetry and efficiency in order to flow with and punch through the chop.


Stocks attempting to build bases in difficult markets show similar adaptations. One common result: the base-on-base pattern.


From an investor's standpoint, a base-on-base can be an exercise in frustration. A stock forms a base, breaks out, then immediately falls back into a second consolidation. An ideal base-on-base sees the low of the second consolidation just touch the high point of the prior base.


In reality, the stacked patterns can seem messy and disorderly.  But they generally are an indicator of a strong stock, struggling to advance against a stubborn market. This is one of the reasons why the [M in CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) stands for [market conditions](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). Stocks fighting a weak market are clearly trying to swim upstream.


Rather than showing the typical 20%-plus gain that separates distinct bases, leading stocks in choppy markets may rise only a few percentage points before pulling back. Often, they will form a flat base after a breakout from a cup, and use that as a platform from which to advance.


When a base dips well into a prior base, this is generally called a base-beside-a-base pattern. It is still a valid structure, but doesn’t normally carry the firepower of a base-on-base. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has staged an awkward base-beside-a-base pattern since November, yet is still advancing in price. **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) and **Prestige Brands Holdings** ([PBH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBH)) offer somewhat more tidy examples.


In some cases, particularly in consolidating markets, a new base will dive back below the low of the prior base. This decline resets the stock’s base count. The new base is considered a first-stage formation, suggesting that the stock may have additional room to advance. **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) and **Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)) demonstrate recent base resets.


**Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)) has traded tightly for a fourth straight week, and the recent price movement rests just at the high of its prior base. If it holds for another week, the pattern becomes a flat base-on-base.


![ICch-EW-050616](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ICch-EW-050616-1024x587.jpg)Maybe the best recent example comes from **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)). A leading maker of heart valve replacements, Edwards has stacked up a series of base-on-base and base-next-to-a-base patterns beginning early last year. Its first breakout – from a cup-with-handle base in July 2015 – rose for less than two weeks before turning down into another cup-with-handle **(1)**.


Investors would not have wanted to hold through this 21% deep consolidation. But the trick is to keep the stock on a watch list. Those who jumped in at this second breakout, in late October, took a little longer ride, rising about 8% in less than six weeks. Then, another consolidation. Shares corrected 13%, cleared an 80.95 handle buy point in heavy trade Feb. 2 **(2)**, then dropped 6.9% below the pivot -- stopping just short of a sell rule (please see a [daily chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at Investors.com). Edwards retook the buy point in a three-day run up in mid-February.


The stock rose 11% in two weeks before stalling into a flat consolidation. Unlike the prior consolidations, this pattern dipped only 7% and held comfortably above its 10-week moving average. The breakout this time around was a killer: up 17% in powerful trade on April 4 after positive trial results on its Sapien heart valve.


True to character, shares rose another 7% over the next three weeks, then pulled back for what may well become another consolidation. But stay tuned....

Even when a base pattern has good characteristics, it could still be flawed if it doesn't have the right physical framework.

That's because in stock charts, shape matters. In most cases the smooth-looking base wins over the jagged one.

What exactly does this mean?

In stock charts, it's the way the price bars are formed that can tell investors if the base is right or wrong. This goes beyond simply checking if the decline in the base is too deep (a fault) or too narrow in length (also a fault).

A well-formed base has smooth contours and symmetry. It lacks the problematic shapes of weak bases, namely wide-and-loose price action or awkward-looking formations. For example, a sharp decline at the start of the base followed by a slow recovery would give a base an asymmetrical look.

When a cup base shows symmetry, the stock tends to take a roughly equal number of weeks to form the left side as it did to form the right side.

The well-ironed base shows the stock is in steady hands â€” institutional investors who are fairly committed to it. Wild bases indicate uncertainty in the market about the stock, and often a shortage of high-quality institutional sponsorship.

To illustrate the proper shape of a base, let's break down an example of a good base vs. a bad one.

From September to mid-January, **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) formed one of the cleanest-looking cup bases in a while. It had a reasonably shallow correction of 24%. It was easy to draw a curved line along the four-month pattern. Many weeks of the base had small price swings. The left side of the base was nine weeks long vs. 10 on the right side.

This base showed smooth trading action.

Tableau, which makes enterprise software to help analyze mounds of data, broke out Jan. 16 from a short handle and has soared as much as 42% from the 71.88 buy point.

By comparison, athletic apparel firm **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) formed a clunky base in 2011 that had its share of faults. Although it had the rough shape of a cup with handle, the pattern was volatile, with large weekly price swings.

That gave the base a sharp-edged V-shape. The handle was volatile as well. Its 23% correction from the handle high of 80.80 was excessively deep.

Under Armour made barely an 8% gain from its breakout at 40.50 before it started correcting again. Its later bases were better crafted and resulted in much stronger gains than the crumpled mess of July-October 2011.

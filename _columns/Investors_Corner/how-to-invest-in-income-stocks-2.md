In 2013, IBD introduced a series of enhancements to [The Income Investor column](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-income-investor.htm) that give this class of investors considerably more research.


In the IBD Weekly newspaper, the column has been expanded with a half-dozen charts of leading income stocks. IBD subscribers also have full access to a triple-screen combination of [leading dividend stocks](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/dividend-leaders-sep-24-2019/), [top utility companies](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/utility-leaders-sep-24-2019/), and [superior real estate investment trust stocks](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/reit-leaders-sep-24-2019/).


You can see the daily changes to all three stock lists at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/), found under Stock Lists in the main navigation bar of Investors.com.


Income seekers often favor utilities; revenues tend to be predictable. REITs by law must pass on most of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends, which makes them attractive to income investors.

The third screen searches for larger companies with solid earnings and dividend profiles. They tend to have an annualized yield that beats the S&P 500 as well.


Income Investors Should Focus On This Fundamental Factor
--------------------------------------------------------


All three screens will help readers find companies with steady profit growth. The chart action carries less importance.Â Steady and growing dividends serve as another key trait of the companies in the income screens. Price, volume and other factors are included in the screens to filter out lower-quality stocks.


The column provides a close look at a particular company, its fundamentals, markets and dividend situation.


The accompanying charts display weekly price and volume, certain financial figures and IBD ratings. But they have one more piece of data that may interest investors greatly: the annualized dividend yield, found in each mini chart.


Best Dividend Stocks: Don't Ignore The Chart
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/wIC-092619-268x300.jpg)Like in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), a brief chart analysis appears at the bottom of the charts.


Investors can use the screens to find some opportunities. Yet bear in mind that any company discussed in the column deserves special attention. Sometimes, IBD editors choose to cover dividend-focused exchange-traded funds, or broader topics affecting income investors.


In some cases, you might benefit more by aiming at companies with a smaller but more dependable dividend. A tempting yield should not make up for a questionable company outlook or descending share price. Remember, by definition a falling share price results in a higher dividend yield.


Don't assume the screens or the companies covered are buy recommendations. Also, the principle of bottom fishing doesn't work in income investing, or any other approach.


Finally, don't confuse income investing with value investing. The latter tries to identify a company's worth, and those trading at a lesser value than they're worth are considered the best investment choices.

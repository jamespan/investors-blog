  Three-Weeks-Tight May Be Clue To Expect More Gains

Tighter is better. And a three-weeks-tight pattern may be a clue that your stock is about to add to its winning ways. 

  

A three-weeks-tight is just what it sounds like. The stock will trade typically in a small range for three weeks, with closing prices each Friday no more than 1.5% above or below the prior Friday's close.

  

But there's more to look for.

  

First, the stock must be rising from a base. Maybe you're frustrated that you had missed the ideal buy point, or wishing you had bought more than you did.

  

Remember, the three-weeks-tight is an add-on point, a spot that signifies a pause within a strong uptrend. The time to buy is when the stock moves past the highest price within the pattern.

  

A three-weeks-tight is not a base, so when you add shares, only buy a tiny bit. You don't want the average cost of your position to rise fast.

  

Tightness in a stock's trading behavior is a telling clue that big-money institutions are comfortable holding a position in the stock.

  

These are the powerful forces that prevent profit-taking or weak-hand selling from doing much damage to a stock.

  

If the stock you're looking at has no history of big gains, a three-weeks-tight pattern probably is nothing to get excited about.

  

**Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) revealed a three-weeks-tight in 2007. In this case, Potash not only built an entry for investors but showed a longer-term improvement in its chart structure, probably reflecting the rising number of funds scrambling for this stock.

  

Potash broke out of a 62-week base in October 2006. The base was wide and deep. No one would have blamed you for passing on it.

  

But the fertilizer producer went on to build a flat base in the five weeks through 2007 **1**. What better pattern can a stock construct to atone for its previous sloppy ways?

  

Now look at the three-weeks-tight not far above the 56.39 split-adjusted buy point **2**.

  

Potash rose 9% in the week ended April 13, the first week of the three-weeks-tight. The stock then showed weekly rises of 0.4%, 0.7% and 0.1% the next three weeks. This pattern actually turned into a 4-weeks-tight, a variation on the same theme. Potash rallied past the 64.70 entry and rose 135% by December.

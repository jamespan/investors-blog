A few years ago, a self-help book and movie came out called "He's Just Not That Into You."

This just as easily could've been about the stock market, because the market sometimes acts like a bad-outcome romance.

It works like this: Investor meets stock. Stock treats investor badly. Investor puts more money into stock in hopes stock will realize the error of its ways. Stock treats investor even worse. Investor pours more money into stock because this just can't be true.

Rarely, does this story end well.

If a man could give his daughter some advice about stocks, it'd be the same as his advice about guys: Don't believe what they say. Believe what they do. And never make excuses when they're not doing what they should be doing. Just get rid of them.

A stock that's treating you badly should be sold when it violates the 8% sell rule. No exceptions.

And an investor should never buy more shares of a losing stock, which is known as "averaging down." This can be devastating.

On March 24, 2011, **OpenTable** ([OPEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPEN)) broke out of a square-box base in strong volume. **1** A month later, the stock was 20% past the 96.07 buy point. **2**

The company had a good story. A provider of online reservation systems for restaurants, it appeared to have room to grow. Earnings and revenue growth was strong. Profit margins were accelerating.

Yet, the 20% gain would've been a good time to take profits for two reasons.

First, OpenTable had risen more than 240% since breaking out of an IPO base 14 months previous. By March 2011, too many people knew the story.

Second, taking profits at 20% is the most usual place to take profits. Most stocks will begin to consolidate after such a gain.

For investors who didn't take the 20% profit, the 8% sell rule was triggered two weeks later **3** when the stock gapped down 15% in huge volume on May 4, 2011.

The company reported quarterly results that beat on EPS and revenue but apparently not by enough. OpenTable also announced a CEO change.

Taking the 8% loss would've been hard to swallow. At the peak, OpenTable was 23% above the buy point. A 23% gain that suddenly turns into an 8% loss is painful. Yet, the disciplined investor knows that a great pain can be followed by a greater pain.

What if instead of selling, the investor decided to average down?

The "opportunity" to average down continued for six months as the accompanying chart illustrates. OpenTable eventually fell 73% off its high. **4**

Such pain can be avoided if the investor realizes that, whether your stock is rising or falling, "The Market's Just Not That Into You." It's never about you.

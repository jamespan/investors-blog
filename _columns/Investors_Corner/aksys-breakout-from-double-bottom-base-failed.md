Why did **Aksys**' ([AKSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKSY)) breakout in 2004 fail?


As this Investor's Corner series shows, it always helps to go over things that go right — and those that go wrong. Both will offer valuable lessons for the future.


Aksys, which shut down operations in 2007 due to a cash crunch, provided blood dialysis equipment and services for those suffering from chronic kidney failure.


The stock had more than quadrupled from its 2002 low near 3.50, then dived from its peak of 15.85 on July 24, 2003.


This harsh decline marks the start of a new base. But you knew pretty fast this base looked plain wrong.


First, the stock dropped 56% in the first three weeks of its base-building process **1**. Could this be traced to a steep broad-market correction? Nope. The market was fine. Aksys wasn't.


Aksys then rebounded from its 40-week moving average (equivalent to the 200-day on a daily chart), and regained its 10-week line about six weeks after bottoming out **2**. But the rapid gains appeared amid fading volume **3**. The price-volume divergence was stark.


In late September, Aksys logged a big weekly downside reversal, although no special volume was seen. But that loss pushed Aksys below its 10-week line, which, over the ensuing few weeks, acted as clear resistance **4**.


That marked the start of a decline to 6.50, which would prove to be the second bottom of a double-bottom base **5**.


But what kind of a base? One that holds a correction of 59%. Again, the market was not falling out of bed. The bull market, in fact, was in good shape.


What's more, note all the time that Aksys spent below its moving averages — too much time.


Aksys quickly rebounded, only to find stubborn resistance at its 40-week line. Seven weeks of sideways action made for a handle **6**. But what sort of a handle? It was too low.


So when Aksys broke out from its double-bottom-with-handle pattern on Feb. 2, 2004, what did you see? Lots of volume as the stock pushed past its 10.07 buy point **7**.


But the base was too deep, too sloppy, with too much time spent at its bottom. And the handle was too low. By the end of 2006, the stock traded as low as 42 cents.

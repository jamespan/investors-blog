A little bit of this and a little bit of that is fine when you're putting together a spice mix to put on your roast or when you're adding toppings on your frozen yogurt.

  

When trading stocks, you shouldn't mix the [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/) investment methodology with other trading systems.

  

CAN SLIM is already a tried and true investment system that combines fundamental and technical factors.

  

**Follow The System**

  

Why mix things into a system that's already based on the qualities seen in the past greatest stocks in market history?

  

In a nutshell, CAN SLIM focuses on buying stocks of leading companies with breakthrough products or services that are rapidly growing earnings and sales.

  

These stocks are only bought when they break out from certain price patterns, which ideally have other positive technical traits. They also should be under heavy accumulation by institutions, the biggest force in the stock market.

  

Perhaps most important, there's a market-timing aspect to CAN SLIM. Long trades have a better chance of working when the market is in an uptrend.

  

Mixing CAN SLIM with other trading systems just makes things more complicated. There's already a large amount of work involved in finding and monitoring breakouts in CAN SLIM stocks. Adding more stringent criteria can cause you to overlook potential winners.

  

Another hazard: Mixing trading strategies can give you contradicting signals. Oscillators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Stochastics can be used to tell you that a stock is in overbought territory and should be sold. But the stock may just be breaking out from a base and rushing into new highs.

  

Developed by renowned technical analyst J. Welles Wilder, the RSI is a standard technical indicator found in just about any charting platform. Despite having relative strength in its name, the RSI compares average price gains in a single stock or market index against average losses.

  

It can be used to determine when a stock is oversold and due for a bounce, or overbought and due for a pullback. The indicator can also be used to spot divergences. A new high that is not accompanied by a new high in the RSI can be a bad sign. A new low that's not confirmed by the indicator can be a good sign.

  

**A Breakout Means Strength**

  

**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), a Leaderboard stock, broke out from a cup-with-handle base with an 81.85 buy point June 19 in strong volume. The stock hit a five-month high that day. The stock was buyable, according to the CAN SLIM rules.

  

But its 14-day RSI was already at 82. Readings above 70 are a typical signal that the stock is overbought.

  

Likewise, the RSI indicator was also in the "overbought zone" when **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) cleared a 72.60 buy point from a double-bottom base May 29. Its RSI was at 86 that day **(1)**.

  

Palo Alto develops next-generation security software and has been an IBD Leaderboard mainstay since Aug. 13. It rose 18% before pulling back to its 50-day moving average in mild trade **(2)**.

Successful stock investors could have handily outperformed a strong year in the stock market with huge gains from top growth stocks like [Dow Jones leader](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)). But it's never too late to improve your stock trading for 2020. In fact, even the best investors perform an annual post-analysis to learn from their biggest successes — and failures.




Stock Trading: Post-Analysis Checklist
--------------------------------------


To get started, start analyzing your stock trading in 2019. Sometimes the way you think you trade isn't reflective of how you actually trade. So the first step is to print out the daily and weekly charts of the stocks you traded in 2019, using either IBD or MarketSmith charts. Next, mark where you bought and sold in each stock.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ICapple123019-300x165.jpg)As you go through each trade in your 2019 post-analysis, here are a few questions to ask yourself.


**1. Was the stock market in a confirmed uptrend when you purchased the stock?**


IBD research indicates that three out of four stocks follow the trend of the overall stock market. Buying in a confirmed uptrend significantly increases your chances of stock trading success. This year's stock market uptrend [started on Jan. 4](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/) after a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on the S&P 500 index.


To help you stay in step with the market, check out [IBD's Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) for daily updates. You can use the [Stock Market Today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) updates to track the intraday action of leading stocks and the major indexes.


**2. Did you buy the right stock?**


Focus your stock trading on the top growth stocks in the stock market, like the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) stocks. These companies have dynamic earnings and sales growth with compelling price action.

Use the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) to help you easily identify the top stocks. For example, the [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) can be used to measure the quality of a stock's fundamental and technical characteristics. You should strive to buy the top one or two stocks in an industry group.


**3. Did you buy the stock at the proper time at the proper price?**


It's not about getting the best price for your stock purchase. More important is buying at the right price at the right time. The right place is the [chart pattern's](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) proper [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The right time is the [breakout day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Check out [MarketSmith Pattern Recognition](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) to help you train your eye to identify good chart patterns.


**4. Did you follow your sell rules?**


When you mark your exit from a stock, identify the reason and ask if it was logical.


IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks," " . . .buying precisely right solves most of your selling problems." The key IBD sell rule is to cut your losses when a stock falls 7%-8% below the proper buy point. This is the simplest way to preserve your hard-earned capital.


For any stock in which you have a gain, it's important to watch for sell signals to take profits.


Learn From The Top Stocks Of 2019, Like Apple
---------------------------------------------


There were a number of big winners in 2019, like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Let's examine its stock action in 2019 to see how we ideally should have handled the stock.


The year started off dismal for Apple stock, when it plunged 10% on Jan. 3 after a sharp Q4 pullback. The company cut its sales forecast at the time. At its 142 low, the stock was down as much as 39% from its 233.47 all-time high. For the next seven months, Apple recovered from those lows and traced a giant [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) chart pattern with a 215.41 buy point. The stock [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past the buy point on July 31.


But three days later, the stock triggered the [7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-balance-profits-and-losses-in-any-market-environment/) amid the escalating U.S.-China trade war. But the next day the stock started a rally that ran over the next month, forming a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-growth-stocks-how-to-spot-the-flat-base-amid-long-winding-chart-action/) with a 221.47 buy point.


Apple shares broke out past this new entry on Sept. 11. Currently, Apple is extended above the 20%-25% profit-taking zone from that breakout.


Apple would have provided a nice gain if you bought it right. Did you? If you missed it, you might consider adjusting your stock screens to make sure you're looking at stocks like Apple when they're near buy points. If you bought it but your gain was small, you might want to review the rules for proper buy points.


Stock Trading Rules For 2020
----------------------------


After researching your past trades and the biggest winners of 2019, analyze your flaws.


Perhaps you sold too soon because you were too afraid of giving back gains. Or maybe you held too late and turned a 15% gain into a 7% loss. Check out some of [IBD's rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/) to help you make better decisions.


If a common theme of your post-analysis of your stock trading was taking profits too early, remember that most profits should be taken when a stock is up [20%-25% from its entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).


Another common stock trading mistake is letting a solid gain turn into a big loss. To avoid a [round-trip sell rule,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) be sure to sell before a gain of at least 10% becomes a loss.

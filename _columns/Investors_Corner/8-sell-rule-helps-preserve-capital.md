  The 8% Sell Rule Keeps Losses Small, Shields Capital

An investor who buys a stock without having a clear sell strategy is courting danger.


There's no guarantee that any stock will keep rising after it breaks out of a proper base, no matter how strong its fundamentals or how solid its chart pattern.


That's why the 8% sell rule helps keep losses small and preserve capital. The rule is applied when a stock falls 8% below your purchase price, no matter what.


But if the action immediately after the breakout is clearly negative, it's even better to sell early.


"The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you're wrong," wrote IBD's founder William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Remember, the bigger the loss, the harder it is to recover. An 8% drop requires only an 8.7% gain to get back to break-even. But a 25% loss requires a 33% profit the next time. And a stock that plunges 50% must double to get back to break-even.


"You must sell without hesitation â€” no waiting a few days to see what might happen; no hoping that the stock will rally back; no need to wait for the day's market close," O'Neil wrote.


If you still like the stock, wait for it to form a new base with a new buy point. In the meantime, it's best to search for other leading stocks breaking out of bases.


**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) began forming a flat base in late July with a 110.06 buy point. The base was late-stage, making it risky, even if Alexion's fundamentals were strong and its industry group top-notch.


It cleared the entry on Sept. 7 **1** (weekly chart is shown), but volume didn't pick up until Sept. 21. **2** Still, the drugmaker went on to hit a record high of 119.54 on Oct. 5, a gain of 9%. **3**


But then the stock began pulling back, breaching its 10-week line and falling 8% below its buy point on Oct. 22 in volume that was 170% above normal. **4** That triggered the sell rule. Those who still failed to sell are now sitting on an 18% loss.


Note that IBD research shows that leading stocks rarely fall 8% below their proper buy points. So stocks that are showing weakness should be sold quickly, even before losses hit 8%.


In Alexion's case, a truly savvy investor may have decided to sell when volume failed to pick up in the days following the breakout. Volume should be at least 40% above average on the big move up.


The market correction that began Oct. 10 was another shot across the bow. Proactive selling could have gotten you out with a small gain or a minimal loss.


Of course, investors who had bought at an earlier buy point are still sitting on a big profit and have more leeway to see if Alexion can bounce back. But a gain should never become a loss.

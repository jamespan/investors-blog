Identifying a stock's buy point on a chart is often a straightforward endeavor.

Recognizing a cup-with-handle buy point (10 cents above the high of the handle) or flat-base buy point (10 cents above the high of the left side of the base) isn't tough, as long as it's a sound base. Earlier, more aggressive entry points, are also possible.

When it comes to the [double-bottom pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/), learning to recognize a Shakeout + 3 setup can help get you into a potential leader before it crosses a conventional buy point. The pattern was discovered by Jesse Livermore in his book "How To Trade In Stocks."

Livermore was a legendary trader in the early 20th century, perhaps best known for making and losing four stock market fortunes, each running into the millions of dollars at the time -- a huge sum now and an even bigger sum back then.

To recognize the Shakeout + 3, you first have to know what a proper double-bottom pattern looks like. The double-bottom looks like the letter W. There are two legs down in the pattern, and it's important that the second leg down undercut the first so that sellers get adequately shaken out of the stock.

The conventional buy point comes when the stock starts to rally after the second leg down. The entry is when the stock crosses above the middle peak in between the two down legs. Add 10 cents and there's your buy point. The Shakeout + 3 pattern also comes when a stock starts to rally after the second leg has formed. The buy point is derived by adding three points to the low of the first pullback. So if the first low was 27, add 3 points to get a correct entry at 30. Note that adding three points generally applies only to stocks that are trading in the 20-40 range. Always demand strong volume when a stock clears the proper buy point.

With higher-priced stocks, it's prudent to add more than three points to the first low. A general rule of thumb to follow is to add around 10% to the price of the stock. If the stock is priced at 60, you can added five or six points to the low to get the buy point. For a stock that trades at 100 or more, adding 8 to 10 points should suffice.

It also yielded an early Shakeout + 3 entry. It hit a low of 22 during its first leg down on Aug. 23, 1990, then rallied back to a high of 27 almost four weeks later. The next leg down saw Cisco hit a low of 19.75. It undercut the first low, resulting in a good shakeout.

When the stock started to rally again, astute investors could have begun buying shares at the Shakeout + 3  buy point of 25 (3 points added to the first low of 22). Cisco cleared the entry on Oct. 18, one day before it gapped over the traditional double-bottom entry of 27.10 (10 cents above the high of the middle part of the W). Cisco rallied 143% by February 1991 before building a new base.

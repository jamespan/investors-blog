A strong track record of quarterly and annual earnings-per-share growth is a critical ingredient to a stock’s success. Growth prospects ahead are also important.

A company’s earnings estimate for the current quarter can be found in IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com. It’s located in the Fundamental Performance section under the subhead, "Current Earnings." A green dot means “pass” and is assigned only to firms with an estimate of at least 18%. A company’s annual earnings estimate is shown in the Annual Earnings section. To get a green dot, the estimate must be greater than or equal to 25%.

Quarterly estimate data can also be found in weekly minicharts in the IBD 50 (published every Monday and Wednesday), Sector Leaders (daily) and IPO Analysis (Tuesday and Thursday). You can also find the data for every stock with IBD’s [eTables](http://shop.investors.com/products/premium-investing-tools/etables/?src=APA1BQ8) product at Investors.com. The IBD 50, New America Index, 85-85 index and the Big Cap 20 are also available electronically with eTables.

The accompanying table shows firms with a strong record of earnings growth and solid estimates for the current quarter and fiscal year.  Many stocks with big earnings growth and estimates have pulled back sharply in recent weeks. The problem right now is the market, which shows massive distribution.

Strong growth at **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is showing no signs of letting up. Same with chipmaker **Macom Technology** ([MTSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTSI)).

It’s tough for a company to maintain fast growth for multiple quarters in a row. Estimate data can be used to flag the beginning of a growth slowdown. If a sharp deceleration in growth is expected, it’s important to find out if it’s due to an extraordinary event.

"Even the best companies can have a slow quarter every once in a while. So before turning negative on a company, I prefer to see to see two consecutive quarters of material slowdown," wrote Bill O'Neil in "How To Make Money In Stocks."

Never look at EPS estimates in a vacuum. Strong growth is one thing, but if institutional investors are selling the stock in spades, it doesn't mean much. For example, annual EPS estimates look great at **Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)). The Chinese e-commerce firm hasn’t reported fourth-quarter results yet, but 2015 profit is seen rising 58% with 2016 profit up 38%. But the stock has been in a downtrend since April and is 62% off its high.

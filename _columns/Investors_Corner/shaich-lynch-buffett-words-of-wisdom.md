Rules, rules, rules, rules, rules.

The IBD reader who indiscriminately follows all of the dozens of rules on how to select, buy and sell growth stocks has a strong chance of making big money in the market.

Such a disciplined investor even has the potential to beat the pros.

But following rules is hard.

Emotions can rule the mind. So can the urge to blaze one's own path, trying to come up with a system that's even slightly better than one that has been built upon decades of objective, numbers-based study and research.

If you follow IBD rules to the hilt, read no further.

But if you desire to become ever more convinced why IBD's trading system works, consider the following quotes by successful professionals in the investing business. These words of wisdom jive with IBD's philosophy of how to participate in one of the most dynamic, puzzling and complex arenas of human interaction.

A few big scores in the market — and a few nasty falls — are perhaps the best way to fully appreciate and understand key rules such as the golden rule (sell a stock when it falls 8% from your purchase price, no matter what) or the basic buy rule (buy shares only when a stock moves past its proper buy point in big volume).

Nevertheless, great investors learn from other great investors.

One more suggestion. Do you go to your local IBD Meetup group? Perhaps you could suggest building a list of quotable quotes about the stock market.

_"No one can outsmart the market; you treat the market like you're dancing with a gorilla. If it wants to lead, let it." — Bill Berger_

This quote came from "Horse Sense. Street Smarts," by Don Hodges, a veteran investing professional who's compiled quotes on business and life for 40 years.

Berger's point: Trying to outsmart the market is essentially trying to predict what will happen three or six months from now. Don't. Read market columns including The Big Picture and Research Table Review to know what the market is doing _right now_, then act smartly.

The next several quotes also came from "Horse Sense." You can also go to a library or the Internet to find additional quotes on the art of investing.

_"When you hear that a stock is going to be 'the next,' just block it out. The next Toys R Us didn't work, the next Home Depot didn't work, and the next Xerox didn't work. Anytime you hear 'the next anything,' just forget it."_

_— Peter Lynch_

Lynch, former manager of Fidelity's Magellan fund, was a master of finding the great companies and holding them.

_"Market research tells you what happened yesterday. Sensitivity tells you where the world is going."_

_— Ronald Shaich_

Although the founder and co-CEO of **Panera Bread** ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) may have been talking about business in general, his words ring clear in the world of growth investing.

_"I don't read, much less follow, the valuations or predictions. I study the numbers." — John Neff_

The astute IBD reader focuses on the numbers too.

_"If you have a total intolerance for not making mistakes, you'll be unhappy in this business."_

_— Warren Buffett_

Cut your mistakes — that is, your losses — short.

What should you make of stock splits?


IBD has researched this matter over the years and reached a few conclusions.


For starters, the research showed that a stock often reaches a price top around the second or third time that it splits.


So in general, don't just shrug off a split. It ought to inspire you to give your stock a hard look and think about how it's performed, how long you've held it, and whether it might be time for you and this old friend to go your separate ways.


Keep in mind some key examples like **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)). After a monster advance, the chip designer topped in December 1999, just after its 4-for-1 stock split.


IBD's research also has found that the stock market's biggest winners generally didn't split in the year preceding their great price advances.


Sure, some did. About 18% in fact, according to the research.


But that means four out of every five leading stocks didn't have a split in the year before their big moves.


A look at some current market leaders suggests this finding continues to be about right.


Consider the top 10 stocks in the IBD 50 lineup as of the Feb. 27 edition. This bunch includes longtime leader **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), specialty retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), tech stock **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) and December IPO **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)), a manufacturer of high-end clothing and accessories.


Just two of the 10 split in the past 12 months â€” right about what you would expect.


The two that split are **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


Alexion executed a 2-for-1 split in May, and the drugmaker has managed to stage a strong advance since then. Now with 186 million shares outstanding, the supply of stock on the market is not excessive.


Meanwhile, Lululemon's split occurred in July.


The seller of high-end athletic clothing then joined in the broad market's struggles in the second half of 2011. But it's now managed to move to fresh highs.


Note that these splits by Alexion and Lululemon weren't out of the ordinary. William J. O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has warned against splits that are in the range of 3-for-1, 5-for-1 or greater, calling them excessive.


"In my opinion, it's usually better for a company to split its shares 2-for-1 or 3-for-2," he wrote in his best-seller "How to Make Money in Stocks."


"Oversized splits create a substantially larger supply and may put a company in the more lethargic, big-cap status sooner."


In other words, the more-modest splits by Alexion and Lululemon are what you prefer to see.


In any case, why do companies split their stock?


In large part, it's because many executives believe that a lower share price will draw more buyers, especially individual investors.


Remember that seeing a company split its stock for the first time is less troubling than noticing a later split.


After all, O'Neil said in his book that a stock "will usually end up moving higher after its first split in a new bull market."


The later splits are when you should especially be on guard. As mentioned earlier, research has shown that a stock frequently touches a price peak around the second or third time that it splits.

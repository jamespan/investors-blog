You are watching shares of a new IPO and wonder, "Is it experiencing heavy institutional demand?" To help answer the question, don't forget to use the up/down volume ratio.




In an instant, the up/down volume ratio gives you a sense of how strong is the level of turnover on the upside if a stock is forming a complete new base, such as a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) or [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), or ready to break out past a [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and launch into new highs.


The ratio compares the total amount of volume during up days in price vs. down days within the past 50 trading sessions. This time frame is significantly shorter than IBD's proprietary Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which covers 65 days, or about 13 weeks.


Readings above 1.0 indicate that volume on the upside is higher than on the downside. But a reading of 1.5 is considered unusually strong, so look for IPO stocks that post a reading at this level or higher.


Find the up/down ratio by looking in the "Supply and Demand" portion of [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) at investors.com or on the left-side panel of all [Leaderboard charts](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx))

Roll the clock back nearly 12 years to when internet search giant **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) (known back then as Google) cleared a 113.58 buy point of a [perfect IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) in September 2004.


The base took just 15 trading days to form. The mild decline of 13% from the base's high of 113.48 to low of 98.94 showed that big fund managers weren't so eager to exit the stock.


When Alphabetbroke out of its IPO base on Sept. 15, 2004, its up/down volume ratio was a whopping 4.7. Indeed, volume on the upside towered over the downside.


In the week before its breakout, the ratio was 3.6, also unusually strong.


After a stunning breakout, the internet content group leader soared 318% from its breakout past a 113.58 buy point to a high of 475.11 in the week ended Jan. 13, 2006. More than 12 years later, Alphabet still hits new highs and boasts a long track record of growing profits and revenue.


The correction in IPO bases can be shallow — less than 20%. Or, if the market is volatile, the correction can be much deeper. The buy point in a narrow IPO base is 10 cents above the high on the left side of the pattern.


A high up/down volume ratio doesn't always guarantee investing success. After you buy a new IPO, pay close attention to the price-and-volume action. After a solid rally, negative reversals after hitting new highs, big drops in heavy or rising turnover, and weak rebounds in light trade may signal it's time to ditch the stock. And never forget the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).



Fitness tracking device maker **Fitbit**'s ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)) IPO base formed over five days before the July 1, 2015, breakout. By the week's end, its up/down volume ratio was a stunning 4.0.


Shares broke out past a 40.55 entry and rose 28% in just five weeks before topping out. When a stock makes such a 20%-25% gain over a period of up to eight weeks, it triggers a [key sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) that encourages investors to take at least some profits and sell into strength.


Today, Fitbit shares trade near 5.28 a share, 87% below that proper buy point in 2015.

Many of the stock market's greatest winners will offer you several chances to buy. But not all entries will be from bases.

So if you want to raise your game when it comes to buying top-notch market winners, don't just look for breakouts. Develop an eagle eye for the moment that an emerging winner makes the first or second pullback to the 10-week moving average, as seen on its weekly stock chart (or a 50-day moving average on a daily chart).
The 10-week line tends to draw support from deep-pocketed institutions looking to add to their positions on a setback and to defend the stock from making a bearish slide in price.

But first off, what is the 10-week moving average?

Add a stock's price, taken at Friday's close, for 10 straight weeks. Then just divide that sum by 10. As a new week's close is added, the oldest drops off. That's how it moves.

The 50-day moving average is calculated the same way. Add the closing prices over the 50 most recent trading sessions, then divide by 50. The 50-day line appears in red on an IBD [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), as does the 10-week line on a weekly chart.

Don't confuse the 10-week moving average as being a carbon copy of the 50-day moving average. You might, as there are five days in a trading week. But the 10-week average is not impacted by one-day holidays, such as Labor Day or Presidents Day. Plus, how a stock finishes on any given Friday may vary greatly with how it ended in the first four days of the week.

Institutions may not only want to buy some shares on the cheap. By shoring up the retreating stock's price at the 10-week line, they're also protecting their core position.

Not all retrenchments to the 10-week moving average are alike. Remember, a stock that crashes had tested its 10-week line at one point. In that case, the test failed.

How can you tell if a stock's retreat to its 10-week line should be bought? Look for declining volume as the stock falls, and rising volume as the stock bounces from the line. Also, when a stock falls to its 10-week line, check the price level. Is the 10-week line currently above the correct buy point in the most recent base, such as a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/double-bottoms-make-sure-the-second-leg-undercuts-the-first/), [saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/), or [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/)? If so, good. But if the 10-week moving average is actually below the stock's proper buy point, then it's not a proper entry.

An excellent stock, once it's broken out, rarely falls below the breakout price, let alone 7% to 8% below that entry point. If it does fall 7% below the proper buy point, then you have to protect your hard-earned capital by executing [the golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

Stick with quality stocks, as usual. Those that make [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Global Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/global-leaders/), [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) tend to make excellent candidates for your watch list.

Pay special attention to the stock's fund ownership. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating, found in every stock quote at Investors.com as well as in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), is one way to measure the quality of fund ownership. Prefer a stock with an A or B rating. After all, you want those big guys defending the line.

And stick with just the first or second test of the 10-week line following a breakout from a base. Once you get to the third test, you're pushing your luck.

There is a proper price range in which to scoop up shares, so make sure not to buy too high. If it's trading more than 5% above the recent high before the stock pulled back to the 10-week, it's too far extended.

VanceInfo Technologies, a Chinese provider of software research and IT outsourcing services, had the fundamentals in place that you'd want to see: fat profit and sales growth, a solid RS Rating and rising RS line. Beijing-based VanceInfo thrives in a nation hungry for IT and software help. China accounted for 40% of VanceInfo's sales last year.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ICvance_033017.png)Among the funds that owned this stock at the time of its solid advance following a breakout, you'll find Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX).

VanceInfo broke out from a cup with handle on July 8, 2010 **(1)**. The 25.10 buy point lured a volume surge that amounted to more than twice the stock's usual pace of business.

At the breakout, VanceInfo had strong IBD ratings: a 97 Composite, a 99 for EPS, 91 RS, an A for SMR, and a C+ for Accumulation. In the research tables, VanceInfo was highlighted at the top of the Business Services sector.

Maybe you weren't among the buyers that day. Or maybe you were, and you wanted to add to your position. Where was the chance?

VanceInfo dithered for a week or two, then moved higher throughout July and August **(2)**. Gains were not sharp, but note how VanceInfo kept close to its 10-week moving average without actually touching it.

Volume during this stretch didn't amount to anything special **(3)**. That is, not until the week ended Aug. 20.

VanceInfo fell below the 10-week line, then regained that crucial marker near 25.49 by week's end **(4)**. Better yet, the stock closed at the high for the week, making an upside reversal. Best of all, this occurred with volume that rose 59% above its 10-week moving average **(5)**. Chance to buy!

By December of 2010, VanceInfo ran up as much as 61% from that follow-on entry point at 25.49 to 41.06. That turned out to be the peak as VanceInfo formed a faulty three-week cup base, then topped. The overall gain from the initial 25.10 entry was nearly 64%.

As the weekly chart shows above, the company showed a long history of trading wildly from week to week. Indeed, many small-cap techs are known to do just that. Yet the decent cup with handle and the breakout that followed helped set up the secondary buy point. You'll also be able to find these rebounds off the 10-week moving average in mid- and large-cap stock leaders.

One more note: When VanceInfo regained its 10-week line, at 25.49, the stock was just 2% past the 25.10 buy point from the cup-with-handle breakout. This is not unusual, but served to confirm the validity of the stock's buying opportunity. But a test of the 10-week line can occur further beyond the initial breakout.

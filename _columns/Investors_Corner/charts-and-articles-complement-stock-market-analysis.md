**Make Money With IBD Stock Checkup:** [Last In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/618220/201207251420/make-money-with-ibd-stock-checkup.aspx)

By reading the past seven Investor's Corner columns on how to use IBD Stock Checkup, you gained a valuable skill.

Checkup, an analysis tool at Investors.com, helps you build and refine a watch list of excellent stocks. You can quickly identify the fundamental and technical traits of stocks that have the potential to rise 20%, 200% or more from a proper buy point.

Your job is not done.

To identify the exact moment to buy a leader, you need to use daily and weekly stock charts to spot the breakout point.

To build the conviction needed to hold the stock through one or more pullbacks in price, you need to read at least one or two articles about the company and truly understand its essence.

The charts and relevant articles, found at the bottom of each Checkup, serve these purposes.

Charts provide key facts and hints about the level of supply and demand for a stock. When demand sharply exceeds supply, a stock surges to new highs.

You could spot a spike in demand by getting price quotes. But only a chart illuminates the key base patterns that precede strong breakouts â€” from the cup with handle to the high, tight flag.

Insightful articles help you understand why a highly rated company is growing faster than the economy, why it's outmatching its industry peers, and why it may be amassing big profits faster than it ever had before.

Articles in the Internet & Technology, New America and Industry Snapshot aim to pinpoint those reasons. Articles in IBD's B section spot signs of institutional demand and positive trends.

Consider **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) when it formed a base-on-base pattern from June to November 2010 .

The pioneer in stylish, premium-priced yoga wear grew earnings from a penny a share in fiscal 2006 to 41 cents in fiscal 2010. No wonder it showed up often in IBD as the market recovered.

Lululemon cleared a 24.27 square-box buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) in November **1**. It rose 165% in eight months.

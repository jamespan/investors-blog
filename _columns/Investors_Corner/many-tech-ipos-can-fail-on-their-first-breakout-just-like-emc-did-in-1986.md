  How To Trade IPO Stocks: A Big Breakout May Need More Than One Try

When it comes to winning in IPO stocks, it pays to learn a bit from recent history. When EMC high-tailed its way out of a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/) with a [superb breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in December 1986, it took place a full eight months after its initial public offering.




And as that [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) took place, Investor's Business Daily put a spotlight on it — sort of like the way California Highway Patrol helicopters do in a nighttime car chase.


Over the long run, EMC emerged in the 1990s as the king of enterprise-scale data-storage devices as computer use swelled in the office and laboratory, and as consumers began buying personal computers.


Yet as seen in the below chart, in 1986 the stock's first two bases did not work out. But the [third breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) proved a real charm.


Why does that happen? Even when a company's fundamentals are brawny, a breakout may still flop because the general market itself exudes weakness.


IPO Stocks And Breakouts: The Broader Market Matters
----------------------------------------------------


Remember this: If you want to win big with your new buys, [always check the state of the market first](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx). Look for the green light, in the form of a "confirmed uptrend signal," before you put down serious coin in a single growth stock.


Go to the [ETF Market Timing Strategy](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), or IBD's [Market Trend page](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) at Investors.com to find out the current status of the market.


If the status is "uptrend under pressure," you can still make money. But choppy, whipsawing action will increase. Breakouts will bear a higher risk of floundering.


When the status is "market in correction," refrain from any new buys. Stay on the sidelines. Wait for a market turn. Confirm that leading stocks are showing teflon-like rises and busting past proper breakout points.


Always strive to have the odds in your favor.

![ic_emc_030117](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IC_emc_030117.png)In the week ended May 23, 1986, EMC rose 20% in heavy trade and popped past a 15.85 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [narrow IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) **(1)**. That base formed over just four weeks.


Five weeks later, the stock slumped 25% from its peak of 17 to as low as 12.75, matching the lowest price within the base.


It was wise to cut losses, even though the market was nearing the tail end of a sharp uptrend.


The Market Must Be Acting Right
-------------------------------


When EMC broke out again in early July of 1986, the Nasdaq began to roll over. On July 7, the Nasdaq composite slumped 2.5% in a sharp increase in turnover vs. the prior session. Such action clearly pointed to [heavy distribution of shares by institutions](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). Three more big distribution days arrived over the next six trading sessions. By July 15, the Nasdaq sank 8% from a peak of 411.33.


The cluster of heavy selling killed the market uptrend. This was a big strike against EMC.


Also, notice how in this second base, the stock gushed straight up from the bottom to a new high **(2)**. That is unsound action.


The risk of a failed breakout from a narrow first base among IPO stocks always ranks quite high.


A 3rd Breakout, A 150% Ascent
-----------------------------


EMC's big move arrived Dec. 4 the same year.


The stock rose 2.25, or 14%, and sprinted past a 17.60 [cup-with-handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) in eight times normal trade. In the Dec. 5 edition of then-called Investor's Daily, EMC was listed sixth on the "50 Stocks With Greatest % Rise In Volume" table.


On the next page in the paper, the OTC Stocks In The News (now part of [Stock Spotlight](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/)) featured EMC's weekly chart, noting a long-term EPS growth rate of 146%, a 99 EPS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 and an 82 Relative Price Strength Rating.


EMC went on to rally 150% in nine months.

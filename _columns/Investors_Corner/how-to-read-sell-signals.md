  SouFun Teaches Lessons In Mixed Sell Signals

China's **SouFun Holdings** ([SFUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFUN)) went public in the U.S. in September 2010. The website offered marketing and listing services to real estate agents and developers.

  

The stock provided investors some invaluable lessons in how a rallying leader can send mixed signals as it begins to top out after making a strong price run.

  

China's housing boom reached its first peak in 2011. Housing prices crumbled, then rose to a second, even higher level. SouFun tapped that double bubble.

  

Starting with a July breakout last year, SouFun surged 227% in 28 weeks. It formed a second-stage base just before staging a deep correction.

  

The stock topped in two stabs. The first occurred this year in January. The second and final peak came in March. Between those peaks, SouFun sketched a six-week cup base and sent investors a spray of mixed signals.

  

The indicators were probably not enough to shake out shareholders who were sitting on healthy gains. But at least they should have had a finger on the sell trigger.

  

The warnings began with an 8% gain in heavy trade on Jan. 22. This pushed the stock more than 100% above its 200-day moving average **(1)** (please see a daily chart). That in itself is not a general sell sign, but it shows the stock is in risky territory. The Jan. 22 session also set up a potential buy point for a new base at 95.49 (before an April 5-for-1 split).

  

Over the next three trading sessions, SouFun pulled back in heavy trade **(2)**, but temporarily found support at the 10-week moving average. A 9% stab below the 50-day line in powerful trade on Feb. 5 was a warning.

  

A 6% drop in volume that was 78% more than usual on Feb. 24 seconded the Feb. 5 fall.

  

But the stock's daily and weekly chart signals were mixed. Shares ended high in the weekly range in early February, which can be seen as signs of potential support.

  

SouFun retook support and pushed briefly above the base's buy point March 5 and 6.

  

It rose again the next day, finishing below the session's midpoint, but above the base's buy point. Another mixed signal.

  

The subsequent pullback came in soft trade, sifting below its 10-week line, then began to cave lower in late March. Within six weeks, the stock lost 40% of its value. The upshot: Investors would have done better to err on the side of caution, act on the sell side of the mixed signals, and lock in gains.

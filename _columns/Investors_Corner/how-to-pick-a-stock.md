Wednesday's [Investor's Corner column](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/761584-use-ibd-stock-checkup-to-check-health.htm) looked at the fundamental elements of [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) at Investors.com. Today, let's look at the technicals, including the chart and fund sponsorship. Technical Performance has 10 items to consider. A green, yellow or red dot stands next to each item. Green means it is acceptable. Yellow is questionable. Red means it fails.

  

• **Price**: This is an easy test. A stock should have a price of \$15 or more. Funds generally avoid low-priced stocks. Unless the average daily volume is high, it's too hard for a fund to open or exit a position.

  

• **RS Rating**: This rating measures a stock's price strength vs. the S&P 500. A rating of 95, for instance, means that the stock is outperforming about 95% of all stocks. Stocks with a high RS Rating tend to continue to outperform. Those with a low rating will have a hard time changing the underperformance without a significant catalyst.

  

• **Percent Off 52-Week High** : A stock that is far off its high is often trying to work through overhead supply. This is resistance involving prior buys of the stock and the desire of holders to cash in around the breakeven level. A deep base is more likely to fail than a base with normal proportions.

  

• **Price Vs. 50-Day Moving Average**: A stock below its 50-day line can be trouble. Also, a stock that rises 51% or more above its 50-day moving average line could be vulnerable to a correction. The 51% rise above the 50-day line doesn't constitute an automatic sell. However, the investor should watch for other signs.

  

• **50-Day Average Volume**: An investor should avoid thinly traded stocks. They are more volatile and often lack institutional support. Keep in mind that low daily volume isn't bad if the price is high. The average daily dollar volume is the real test.

  

• **Market Capitalization**: Depending on the market uptrend, small caps can hold an advantage or disadvantage. Check the S&P 600 or the Russell 2000, both small-cap indexes, to see if they are outperforming the market. The chart showing small-cap growth funds vs. big-cap growth funds (in today's IBD on page A8) can be helpful.

  

• **Accumulation/Distribution Rating**: Are mutual funds and hedge funds buying or dumping shares? This rating will give you a clue. A rating of A points to robust buying, while E points to heavy selling. An investor might look at some back issues to see if the rating has been rising or falling in recent months.

  

• **Up/Down Volume**: A 1.0 rating is neutral. Look for stocks with a rating above the neutral level.

  

• **Percent Change in Funds Owning Stock**: This is another clue to determine whether or not there is strong, growing institutional support.

  

• **Quarters of Increasing Fund Ownership**: This category also points to the support of big-money players.

  

Finally, a investor should look at the chart in Stock Checkup. The chart shows price-and-volume action, the relative strength line and the 50-day moving average. **Fleetmatics Group** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)), No. 5 in Wednesday's [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/), scores strong in the technical factors. The stock is trying to clear a 48.06 cup-with-handle buy point.

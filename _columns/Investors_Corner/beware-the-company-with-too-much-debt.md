The long-term-debt-to-shareholders'-equity ratio. It sounds like an obscure calculation from an overzealous accountant.

  

In fact, it's a key gauge that can alert you to serious problems with a company and its otherwise lovely looking stock.

  

Briefly put, the ratio gauges not just how much a company owes, but also what that long-term debt (what is owed more than a year from now) amounts to as a percentage of the firm's equity.

  

If **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) owes \$1 billion, well, that seems manageable. But if small-cap **Sourcefire** ([FIRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIRE)) owes the same amount (it doesn't), you might feel uncomfortable owning that stock.

  

The long-term-debt-to-shareholders'-equity ratio is found by dividing the total long-term debt by total shareholders equity, then multiplying by 100. A result over 125% tends to be perilous. But it's OK to start worrying earlier â€” say, at about 100%.

  

You also might be on the alert if the company's ratio runs past 100% with sudden spurts.

  

If a company with a history of low debt suddenly starts borrowing at a break-neck pace, it could be a sign of trouble.

  

Of course, the company may have discovered a new oil well or developed a new hot-selling product that simply requires \$1 billion of new capital. Yet many great firms use operating cash flow to invest in future growth.

  

Also bear in mind that a high debt load can mask other flaws. By borrowing, a company can artificially raise its return on equity.

  

That's just hinky. Conceptually, a company is not stronger just because it sold bonds instead of stock. That's a trick you should always keep an eye out for.

  

Some companies and certain industries can get away with a high debt load. Financial and telecom services are capital-intensive businesses, where it pays to borrow a lot. Also expect to see debt issuance in industries undergoing consolidation.

  

How do leaders finance acquisitions of the smaller fish? They have to sell either debt or equity. Of course, that goes back to the question of not letting the higher ROE impress you.

**Athenahealth** ([ATHN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHN)) had one of those days Friday where everything starts off so well, but goes all wrong by day's end.

  

A better-than-expected Q3 report pushed the stock higher right out of the gate, surging as much as 6% with wicked volume.

  

The stock backed off, as many do after such an initial spurt.

  

But Athenahealth couldn't catch a foothold.

  

The retreat from the high was modest at first.

  

But after a few hours, the stock saw its modest retreat turn into a full-fledged rout.

  

Athenahealth ended its session at 58.70, off 4.37, or 7%. At its worst, the stock had sunk 9% below Thursday's close.

  

The result was an outside day, and an outside week, where the range takes out the previous day's or week's high and low.

  

Volume for the session tripled its usual pace.

  

Watertown, Mass.-based Athenahealth makes software customized for doctors' practices.

  

The programs are designed to digitize patients' records, a huge task that the entire medical community must cope with.

  

Athenahealth beat Q3 expectations in its report, released late Thursday.

  

Earnings rose 33%, although weaker than the 183% and 83% gains of the two previous quarters. Sales also rose 33%.

  

Sales also were up 33% in four of the past seven quarters, ranging from 27% to 33%.

  

Earnings beat estimates by 2 cents while revenue beat by a slim margin.

  

Otherwise, Sector Leaders did not offer much excitement in the session.

  

**Randgold Resources** ([GOLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOLD)), with several mines in Africa, rose 1.02, or 1%, to 100.04.

  

Randgold sliced through its 50-day line a month ago.

  

It's been ratcheting higher ever since, with solid resistance at the 50-day line, its former line of support.

  

Big-cap biotech issue **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) poked into a 52-week high and closed up 0.98, or 1%, at 66.93.

  

**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) climbed 1.62, or 2%, to 68.38, ending just 2% shy of its 52-week high.

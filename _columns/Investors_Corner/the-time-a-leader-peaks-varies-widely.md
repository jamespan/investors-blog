What's hot today won't stay hot forever. That goes for many things in life, including stocks.

  

Stocks can have massive runs, but eventually all good things come to an end. Investors need to recognize this and make way for the new breed of leaders.

  

The time it takes for a leading stock's run to be finally over varies. Some leaders run for weeks, others for years. In a study of the greatest stock market winners from 2000 to 2008, the average time from breakout to peak was 109 weeks â€” just over two years.

  

In the study, there was a wide range of time frames. The stock with the shortest run, **Syneron Medical** ([ELOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELOS)), lasted only 13 weeks. It broke out from an IPO base Aug. 26, 2004, and more than tripled in three months.

  

On the flip side, agricultural chemical giant **Monsanto's** ([MON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MON)) reign lasted 266 weeks. It broke out May 13, 2003, and rocketed more than 1,300% before topping in June 2008.

  

Very few companies in the study are on growth investors' radar these days. Companies such as **ArcelorMittal** ([MT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MT)), **Bebe Stores** ([BEBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BEBE)) and **DryShips** ([DRYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRYS)) are well off their peaks in the study.

  

Investors who show the skill, and at times luck, to latch on to a monster winner have to learn to say goodbye. Leaders tumble by an average of 72% off their peaks. So it's important not to overstay your welcome.

  

Some leaders in the study such as **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) and **MEMC Electronic Materials** ([WFR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFR)) dived 85% and 90%, respectively. Shoemaker **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) lost nearly all of its value.

  

A downfall in a leader can be due to changes in the company itself or its industry, or simply because a bear market is at hand.

  

Investors can count bases to see if it's getting late in the game. Third- and fourth-stage bases are considered late-stage. Also, watch out for climax sell signals that tend to occur after a stock has had a long, steep advance.

  

**Research In Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)) dominated the smartphone market for years. The Blackberry maker had several huge runs. But **Apple's** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone and smartphones using **Google's** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) software platform took market share.

  

When RIMM topped in June 2008 **1**, it had tried to clear a fourth-stage base. The stock dropped 30% from a 144.60 buy point in just four months, then collapsed later in the year.

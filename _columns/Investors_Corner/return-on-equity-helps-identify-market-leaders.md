Return on equity is a measure of a company's profitability. It's also an important tool for investors trying to gauge a stock's chances of success.

ROE is calculated by dividing net annual income (before accounting changes and one-time gains or losses) by average shareholders' equity over the past two years. Shareholders' equity, which is equal to total assets minus total liabilities, is also referred to as owners' equity, book value or net assets.

Essentially, ROE helps to identify well-managed companies by measuring how much profit a company generates from its total net assets. For example, a company that earns 10 cents on each dollar of equity has an ROE of 10%.

IBD research shows that the greatest growth stocks of the past 50 years had ROEs of 17% or more. The biggest winners had ROEs of 25% to 50%.

Such companies typically have a competitive advantage that gives them a leg up on the competition, whether it's a new product or service, or method of doing business.

A company's return on equity can be found in the Stock Checkup section of Investors.com. It also appears in the IBD 50 charts, the Big Cap 20 charts, the Weekly Review charts and the charts that accompany the Stock Spotlight.

ROE, along with profit margins and sales growth, is a component of the SMR Rating, which is one of the five proprietary IBD ratings used to identify leading stocks.

The SMR Rating is on a scale of A to E, with A indicating that a stock is in the top 20% of all publicly traded companies.

Nevertheless, it's important to keep in mind that companies can show misleading ROE figures by, for example, borrowing more money, which increases liabilities. In this case, net assets are divided by a smaller shareholders' equity, yielding a higher ROE.

That's why it's best to look at a company's ROE over several years or more to get a feel for the long-term trend.

Also, companies that have high ROEs and low debt-to-equity ratios are usually doing a better job of boosting their return on invested capital.

The table shows several market leaders that had strong ROE and little or no debt when they broke out to new highs.

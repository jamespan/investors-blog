California has been a breeding ground for high-profile businesses in recent years.


Social media giant **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), Internet search firm Google -- now called **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) -- and chip designer **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)) are a few of the stocks that have had success after launching initial public offerings over the past 15 years, a period during which many growth stocks rack up their biggest gains.


As the companies above indicate, California tends to produce mostly tech startups, aided by deep-pocketed Silicon Valley venture capital firms. But retail, finance and consumer products companies have also gone public, including **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), discount retailer **Smart & Final Stores** ([SFS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFS)) and wearable camera maker **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)).


California led the nation with 54 IPOs in 2014, the latest year for which data is available, according to the WilmerHale 2015 IPO report. That was up from 44 in 2013 and marked the fifth straight increase, according to the law firm's report. Massachusetts was second with 23 IPOs, followed by Texas with 20 and New York with 10.


Life sciences companies have been another area of strength in the California IPO market, doubling to 29 in 2014 from 15 the prior year, according to WilmerHale. Among those was La Jolla-based Auspex Pharmaceuticals, which develops treatments for rare conditions such as Huntington's disease, which breaks down nerve cells in the brain. The company was acquired last year by **Teva Pharmaceuticals** ([TEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEVA)) for \$3.5 billion.


Santa Monica-based **Kite Pharmaceuticals** ([KITE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KITE)), which also went public in 2014, rocketed past a 32.75 buy point a cup base on Oct. 2 that year and nearly tripled to a high of 89.21 on Jan. 15, 2015. Like many biotech stocks, however, it's fallen out of favor and now finds itself more than 50% off its 52-week high.


Five California-based companies that have gone public in the past 15 years were in last week's IBD 50. They include Facebook, Monolithic Power Systems, financial software firm **Ellie Mae** ([ELLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ELLI)), medical equipment stock **Masimo** ([MASI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MASI)) and telecom **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)).


Other recent California IPOs include electronic payments processor **Blackhawk Networks** ([HAWK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAWK)), airline **Virgin America** ([VA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VA)) and chip designer **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)).


WilmerHale attributes California's IPO success to a large pool of venture capital-backed companies and a wealth of entrepreneurial talent. Ride-sharing service Uber could be the next big California IPO. The San Francisco-based company was recently valued at more than \$60 billion, according to [recent news reports](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation).


However, CEO Travis Kralnick said last fall that an IPO is likely a few years away due to the company's success in raising money from [private investors](http://fortune.com/2015/10/21/uber-ipo-kalanick/).

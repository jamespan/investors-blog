  Too Early Or Too Late In Investing Leads To Too Bad

Failure in investing can be summed up in two phrases: "Too early" and "Too late."


The investor who buys too early is often buying on a promise of profits. Sometimes that makes for a long wait.


The investor who buys too late probably won't have long to wait. Losses in that case often come quickly.


Avoiding too-early scenarios is fairly easy. Quit buying the promise of profits and wait for proof.


How does an individual investor avoid the too-late scenario?


One way is to count bases.


As a stock rises, it pauses to digest gains and consolidate. Breakouts from these bases provide opportunities and risks. The opportunities usually involve the first- and second-stage bases.


Usually, the greatest risks involve the older stages.


Note the word "usually." There are some stocks that in their heyday broke out from later-stage bases and did fine. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is history's most recent example.


Apple delivered price gains in the range of 31% to 54% from third-, fourth-, fifth- and sixth-stage bases in 2007-12.


An individual investor can take a lesson from the exception: If you are going to buy a later-stage breakout, make sure the stock has exceptional fundamentals and a very strong new factor.


Occasionally, a good but not great stock will deliver gains from a late-stage base, tempting investors to buy its next late-stage base.


Firearms maker **Sturm, Ruger & Co.** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)) formed a base from March to September 2013. The company had strong quarterly earnings growth of 52% to 88% in the previous eight quarters.


However, the stock didn't meet the 'A' criteria in CAN SLIM. The A requires annual EPS growth of 25% or more in each of the previous three years. Ruger had it for two years.


Still, Sturm Ruger broke past a 56.98 entry in a fourth-stage pattern in the week ended Sept. 13, 2013. The stock advanced 41% in about two months.


An odds-defying run can tempt individual investors to ignore the odds.


If Sturm Ruger worked out of a fourth-stage base, why not a fifth-stage base?


The stock cleared an 80.37 buy point in the week ended Jan. 10 of this year **(1)**. Sturm Ruger rose 7% from the fifth-stage base and then headed south. The stock dropped 8% below the buy point in the week ended Jan. 24, triggering a sell signal **(2)**.


Sturm Ruger eventually fell 40% below the ideal buy point **(3)** .

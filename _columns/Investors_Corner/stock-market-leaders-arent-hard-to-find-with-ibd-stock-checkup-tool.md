Stock tips have always been a dime a dozen in the stock market. Some are good, but plenty more are bad. A great way to validate them is with the IBD Stock Checkup tool at Investors.com.




IBD Stock Checkup provides a fundamental and technical breakdown of a stock. Specifically, it looks at the characteristics that historically set apart the most successful stocks, such as excellent earnings growth and superior margins. Put them all together, and you have a quick way to tell if a stock you're researching measures up to past stock market winners.


At the top of Stock Checkup, you can see where a stock ranks in its industry group based on its [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/), [Relative Price Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/), [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-new-stock-market-leaders/), and [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-top-stocks-2/). Focus first on the stocks with top Composite Ratings.


Below that is the IBD Stock Checklist, which gives a stock pass or fail marks based on those crucial fundamental and technical metrics. A green circle basically means pass, yellow is neutral and red is fail. It's good to see as many green circles as possible, but don't automatically dismiss a stock because it doesn't measure up in some areas. Each term has a link that explains what it means.


Don't buy a stock just because it passes most scores and has high ratings. You still should study its price and volume chart, and know something about the business. The Checkup is intended to be a way to filter stocks, rather than picking them for you.


Apple Gets High Marks
---------------------


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) gets generally high marks from IBD Stock Checkup, but it gets a few red circles. One is because it's three-year earnings growth rate is below 25%. Its three-year sales growth rate also gets a red circle, although the 16% rate is good considering the size of Apple and the economy's shifts in that time.

One of the biggest benefits to IBD Stock Checkup is that it uncovers breadth of leadership in a particular industry group. The more leadership in the group there is, the better. Basically, a group with good leadership will have at least several stocks with Composite Ratings of 90 to 99.


Stock Market Leaders
--------------------


Security software stocks were leading the market about a year ago, and the growth runway looked good for several top stocks in the group at that time.  

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wICtbl080221.jpg)In late July 2021, five stocks in the group had Composite Ratings of 94 or higher, according to IBD Stock Checkup.


**Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) was the top-ranked security software stock with a Composite Rating of 98. Its up-down ratio was 1.7 in late July, as the stock bounced off the 10-week line. It held in an uptrend until January of 2022.


**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) held support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) in July 2021 and soared nearly 19% in the week of Aug. 27. Its up-down ratio in late July 2021 was 1.7.

**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

When a market-leading stock starts to lag, it's usually a good time to sell. How do you know when a winner has finally run out of steam?

One way to detect changes is by comparing the stock to others in its industry. Maybe its [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) has started to fade, indicating that institutional investors are bailing. Or maybe its [RS line](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/760311-how-to-spot-a-tired-stock.htm) has begun to trail off relative to its peers.

In April 2011, **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) was hitting a new high after more than tripling from a 46.02 buy point of a cup-with-handle base that it had cleared seven months earlier. **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), another top Chinese name in IBD's Internet-Content group, was peaking at about the same time after enjoying a similarly strong run.

At the time, Baidu boasted best-possible 99 [Composite](http://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/?termID=6080&term=Composite+Rating%2c+SmartSelect%26reg%3b&mode=searchResults) and [Earnings Per Share Ratings](http://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/eps-rating). Sina was close behind with ratings of 99 and 95, respectively. Their fortunes soon started to diverge.

Sina and Baidu both corrected and eventually shaped double-bottom bases. But by the time the stocks were on the verge of breaking out in late July, the difference between them was clear: Baidu was still an IBD 50 stock, maintaining strong [Composite](http://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/?termID=6080&term=Composite+Rating%2c+SmartSelect%26reg%3b&mode=searchResults) and [EPS ratings](http://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/general/eps-rating) of 94 and 99, respectively. By contrast, Sina's ratings had dropped into the 70s, indicating that it had become a laggard.

Furthermore, Sina's base was flawed, diving 47% from peak to trough **(1)**; it showed a handful of wild weekly swings. By contrast, Baidu's base was much less volatile, and it corrected just 27%.

Sina's relative strength line was fading even as it neared its 128.27 buy point in the week ended July 22. Little wonder, then, that the stock embarked on a 17-month slide even as the market trended higher. It hit a low of 41.14 in the week ended Dec. 14, 2012, 72% off its April 2011 high.

Baidu, however, cleared a 148.54 buy point off a handle that formed on its double-bottom base in the week ended July 22. Its RS line was hitting a new high at the time, confirming the breakout. A couple of weeks later, it hit a peak of 165.96 â€” good for a gain of 12% **(2)** before it began to fade.

Keeping a close eye on your stock's technical and fundamental health can help you identify when it's going from leader to laggard, giving you a chance to act accordingly before it does serious damage to your portfolio.

"*It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting."*


So said Jesse Livermore in the classic "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator."


IBD founder Bill O'Neil can also relate. One of his most successful investments was Syntex, the developer of the birth-control pill, in the 1960s. But he didn't make money by simply trading it. He made money by sitting as well.


Make no mistake, though. It's not easy being patient with a big winner. Fact is, few investors capitalized fully on **Home Depot**'s ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) 20-fold move in less than two years from its IPO in September 1981.


And how many investors held on to **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) when it soared more than 80,000% between October 1990 and March 2000? Not many.


Remember that stock you bought last year? You took a 20% profit, only to see the stock rise another 150% from where you sold it.


You're not alone. After a few stinging losses, or due to fear of the future, it's human nature to nail down a quick gain to get your confidence back.


The process of learning how to buy a growth stock is hard enough. Handling it after you buy is even harder. Here are some tips to help you learn how to hold better.


• **Be early.** A breakout generally has the best chance of working in the early stages of a bull market — not the latter stages. This is an important point, and it's certainly relevant to today's market.


Five-plus years into a bull market, recent breakouts have been a mixed bag at best.


• **Expect a pullback.** Sometimes, volatility hits a stock after a breakout and the breakout falls apart. Other times, a breakout shows great promise, but sellers come into the stock and it erases a double-digit gain. In both cases, cutting losses or selling to nail down a gain is smart even if the stock eventually turns into a big winner.


Keep watching the stock. It may offer a second chance to buy it back. If it becomes a winner, give it room to run.


• **Don't fear major corrections.** Emerging leaders with outstanding fundamentals tend to do the best in the early stages of a new bull market. The strong bull markets that started in March 2003 and March 2009 came after extremely sharp pullbacks for the major averages. Both bear-market declines flushed sellers out — so much so that it wasn't hard for stocks to gain traction after both uptrends were confirmed with follow-through days.


After a 19% pullback for the Nasdaq in April to July 2010 that flushed a lot of sellers out, the Nasdaq soared 3% in higher volume on Sept. 1 (please see a daily chart), confirming a new uptrend.


On Nov. 24, **Cerner** ([CERN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CERN)) cleared a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point of 44.54 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split). In this case, it was an easy winner to hold. A big market shakeout earlier in the year helped.


Some volatility hit the champion in electronic medical records management in the second half of 2011. A 53% gain from the buy point temporarily shrank to 21%. Some investors might have decided to take profits, but those with conviction in the stock could afford to sit through the selling. They could also have added shares as the stock broke again in February 2012.

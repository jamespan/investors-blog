A key rule in choppy markets is to tighten up your sell rules. This also goes for stocks acting sketchy in a flat or rangebound market, like the one that has dominated most of this year.


What does "tighten up your sell rules" mean? Friday's [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/776960-learn-to-take-smaller-profits.htm) noted that tightening that upside-sell level from profits of 20%-25% to 10%-15% may allow you to book decent gains â€” even as the market is going nowhere.


But when even those smaller gains are harder to attain, be prepared to exit a stock with a profit in the range of 8% to 10%, or 3% to 5%. You might even be forced to sell at breakeven or at a tiny gain. Those trades initially don't sound good, but they will ultimately feel much better than a loss of 3% to 5% or more.


**CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) provided a good test of tight-rule discipline this year in June. The Israel-based security software developer broke out past a 69.10 cup-with-handle buy point in strong trade on June 8. It immediately turned and pulled back 10% below that entry, tripping tightened sell rules and the standard 7%-to-8% loss-cutting sell rule.


Then, just as quickly, the stock found support at its 50-day moving average and reversed higher.


Savvy investors who had sold may have jumped right back in as CyberArk retook its buy point in nearly triple average trade on June 15 **(1)**, closing at 70.83.


The market was sending mixed signals. The S&P 500 pecked out its high for the year on May 20 and struggled to hold above its 50-day moving average. This dictated a "short leash" strategy.


The Nasdaq traded mildly below an April high, but had consistently found support near or at its 50-day line.


As CyberArk rode four straight days of gains in strong volume en route to a June 18 peak, investors would have been justified in maintaining either standard or tightened sell rules. But those who had reduced their downside limit to 3% and placed a 10% or less limit on the upside would have wound up with more cash.


CyberArk peaked at just above a 10% gain on June 18, days before the Nasdaq hit a new high, then took a hard dive through its 50-day line **(2)**. The Nasdaq also tumbled. IBD's market outlook later that month switched to "uptrend under pressure." Time to go back into "short leash" mode.


The index rebounded to hash out one more new high in July. Then big money investors pulled the plug in July to August. Top to bottom, the Nasdaq corrected 18%. CyberArk shed nearly 47%.

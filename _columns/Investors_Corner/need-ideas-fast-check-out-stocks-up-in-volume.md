Keeping your watch list updated is never a bad idea, since you never know when a fresh name that merits further research could crop up.


IBD is full of potential candidates, from the New America, Internet & Technology and markets columns, to the multiple chart pages such as the Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight, IBD 50 and Big Cap 20. These features can be accessed under the "Research" tab at the Investors.com [home page](https://www.investors.com/).


Another less obvious, but equally handy, feature that investors should check for watch-list ideas is the daily Market Pulse (today on Page B3), which accompanies IBD's No. 1-read daily markets column, [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). Market Pulse not only gives the current market outlook and number of distribution days on the major indexes, it also provides a list of leading stocks up in volume for the day.


Leaderboard also carries the [Weekly Big Picture](http://leaderboard.investors.com/thebigpicture/default.aspx), which also features a separately constructed Market Pulse.


A highly rated stock that's breaking out in heavy trade is likely to show up on Market Pulse. So will a top stock that makes a big move up on solid earnings or some other news. Investors should be watching these names, and they may be worthy of further due diligence.


The "Leaders down in volume" list is important too. It may be worth digging deeper to find out why. Has a fundamental or technical change occurred that could trigger a sell signal for current shareholders? Or is the stock pulling back to a price area of potential support? Will a new entry point emerge?


Take a look at the stock's daily and weekly charts to see how the stock is acting. If it pared losses and closed in the top half of its intraday price range in heavy volume, that could signal support. But a reversal to a lower-half finish in fast trade implies big selling by institutional investors.


Regardless of which list a stock makes, keep in mind that it's included for a reason.  So even if you don't have time to peruse all the columns and charts for ideas, it'll only take a few minutes to come up with a handful of candidates on the daily volume lists.


This is a curated list. Authors of The Big Picture column select stocks that meet IBD's fundamental and technical criteria. Now, not all stocks making the Pulse will be necessarily written about in The Big Picture, but the fact they are included means they could warrant a closer look.


That's why it's a good idea to read The Big Picture and scan Market Pulse every day. There could be some gems revealed that you might otherwise miss.

A quick look at the Market Pulse will tell you if the market is in a confirmed uptrend, under pressure or in a correction. Breakouts tend to fare best when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. And since three of four stocks will eventually follow the market's trend, staying on the same side as institutional investors is sound strategy.


The accompanying table shows watch-list-worthy leading stocks that have been in the "Leaders up in volume" section of the Market Pulse in recent issues.

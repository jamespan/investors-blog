If you're going to tend to your own portfolio, you must learn not to succumb to knee-jerk reactions to the day's news. 


Headlines pour on to your computer screen every day. Violence in Egypt seems to be spreading unrest throughout the Middle East. Assassinations create turmoil in Pakistan or India. China's economy is faltering â€” or is it improving? The Fed will taper. The Fed won't taper.


Then you have to contend with front-page stories written for a particular slant. Consider a story that wound up on Drudgereport.com Aug. 19: "1 in 4 adults in NJ moving back in with parents." That draws your attention, so you click and find yourself on my9nj.com, and it's really depressing.


How can you get through this maze of headlines? You need to stick to the tried-and-true rules for buying and selling stocks.


Focus on stocks with great earnings and sales growth, solid profit margins and healthy sponsorship. Look for solid bases or support at the 10-week moving average following a good breakout. Seek healthy price-volume behavior. Don't buy stocks when the broad market is in a correction.


Maybe you've been studying and trading on these precepts for years. Maybe you're still new at this. Either way, it would be folly to throw it all out the window because of some shooting in Kashmir between Indian and Pakistani soldiers (which indeed is serious and a scary situation).


Or maybe the news is specific to your stock. An analyst downgrades your highflying stock and it falls 5%. Did it breach the most recent buy point or the 10-week line? Did it threaten to turn your profit into a loss? If not, you probably aren't looking at a sell signal.


Still, news can provide useful information.


You don't really care if Value-Minded Securities Research downgrades your stock "based on valuation" (their lingo for "It's gone up too much"). But the reaction could be telling. Sure, it'll go down at first. But what if it reverses higher that day and closes in the upper half of the day's trading range? What if it makes back all of that 5% loss in the next day or two?


Your stock would be shrugging off that bad news, which is just what you want to see. Remember, if your stock is any good, it should be able to withstand some slings and arrows.

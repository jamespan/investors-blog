History shows that many of the biggest winners each year are stocks that had their initial public offerings within the prior 15 years. New, dynamic stocks constantly enter the market: **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) in the 1980s, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) in the 1990s, **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)) in the last decade and **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) in this decade.

Initial public offerings are the freshest merchandise in the market, part of the N (for new) in [the IBD investment system CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2). Young, dynamic companies use the IPO market to gain exposure and raise capital for further expansion.

Many of these companies will be unfamiliar names. So make sure that you take advantage of IBD's extensive IPO coverage to stay on top of the best new issues.

**IPO Coverage In Investors.com**

On IBD's [website](https://www.investors.com), investors.com, check out the [IPO News](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) landing page, which covers upcoming and recent new issues. To get there, click on the "News" tab across the top of the home page, then hover over the "Investing" subhead and click on "IPO News" from the drop-down menu.

Another way to keep track of promising newer issues is via IBD's stock research tables throughout the paper's B section each day. At the top of each sector, just under any Sector Leaders listed, are stocks with EPS and RS ratings of 80 or higher that had an IPO within the last 15 years.

Also, at the top of the New America page is IPO After Market, which charts out recent new issue performance. This mini feature highlights relevant stock action and displays a table of top performers in terms of gain from their IPO pricings.

**Read Twice A Week**

Definitely check out the [IPO Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm) feature (today on B7), in the B section on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which covers leading stocks that made their market debut within the past three years.

The feature typically shows 16 minicharts with analysis and a story highlighting key action. Winning stocks recently covered include **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)), **WhiteWave Foods** ([WWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWAV)), **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)) and **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)).

WhiteWave Foods was featured three times from November last year to January while the stock was basing. At the time, strong fundamentals were noted as well as some challenging technicals as the stock carved the left side of a long basing process. Shares eventually bottomed out and charged up the right side as new accumulation came into the stock.

WhiteWave has climbed as much as 38% since clearing a 36.67 double bottom buy point. Today, it has a 90 Composite Rating.

Tableau specializes in visualization software for data analysis. It was featured in February after a blowout fourth-quarter earnings report sent the stock soaring. Shares settled down after that and found support near a 90.05 buy point that the stock gapped past.

A new base formed, shaping a base-on-base pattern with 99.39 entry. The stock broke out in April and climbed more than 20% over the next two months, giving investors a chance to nail down a nice profit.

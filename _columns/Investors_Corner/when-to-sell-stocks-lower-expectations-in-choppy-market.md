[How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/739732-how-to-trade-stocks-in-a-tough-market.htm)

Following sound buy and sell rules to make solid gains in the stock market is a good thing. But sometimes it pays to be flexible.

When you're in the mood for watermelon and it's not watermelon season, you just have to go with another fruit.

When you're trading stocks, you also have to lower your expectations at times and take what the market gives you.

This is especially true when market conditions turn choppy.

**Follow The Market's Cue**

The direction of the general market has a big impact on how individual stocks trade.

A strong uptrend acts as a tailwind, lifting many stocks. A punishing downtrend will send the bulk of individual names lower.

While you can expect stocks to move up in an uptrend or lower in a downtrend, a choppy, sideways-moving market is much tougher to trade. Stocks will tend to have trouble gaining traction in choppy market conditions.

With the stock market having peaked in late December, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have been stuck in big trading ranges. Leading stocks such as **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) have mostly wavered from their latest breakouts. Even better-than-expected quarterly results didn't help the semiconductor design firm.

When the market is in an uptrend, the idea is to take profits when they amount to 20% to 25%. Losses should be cut at a maximum of 7% to 8%.

But in choppy markets, many stocks will have trouble making those kinds of gains.

The key in tough markets is to temper your profit targets and take smaller losses. Aim to take profits at 10% to 15% and sell your stocks once losses amount to 3% to 5%. This will maintain a 3-to-1 ratio between profits and losses.

The S&P 500 staged a big rally off its Aug. 7 low, but turned sideways in late August. IBD 50 issue **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) staged a breakout past a 52.17 buy point from a six-week flat base pattern on Aug. 20 in fast trade. Volume was 58% above its 50-day average on its breakout day, a signal of strong demand **(1)**.

Despite tough market conditions, the stock rose 11% by Sept. 4 before moving sideways itself **(2)**. Buyers returned Sept. 16, putting the stock's gain at 12% **(3)**. But that was all Foot Locker could muster, as the shoe retail chain started consolidating gains after that. Although it went on to build another base, a breakout past a 58.50 entry did not pan out.

Tenacity is among the more difficult yet more rewarding traits CAN SLIM investors eventually learn to cultivate.


Buy-and-hold investors keep a stock as it spirals deep into a correction. They wager on faith that the stock will at some point rise to regain its prior highs. Students of CAN SLIM sell as a stock slices through its 10-week moving average, undercuts a buy point by more than 8% or threatens to narrow a healthy gain to a pittance.


But the great tendency, after clicking the sell button, is to spike the stock — along with all its research — and move on to seek the next leader near a buy point.


This lapse in attention is why investors all too often miss out on double-bottom bases.


A double bottom is effectively two cup bases, one after the other. The second dips lower than the first. The two are joined by a short-term price peak in the middle. These bases reward investors who hang in there to monitor fundamentally strong stocks through what generally appear to be ugly, double-dip corrections.


Double bottoms are often not pretty. Many times the bases will form with misshapen or disproportionate cups. These can carry a number of flaws, such as being more than 35% deep, or forming V-shaped cups. Or the second low fails to undercut the first.


But even less-than-pretty double-bottoms can produce strong results, so hold steady and pay attention. Many IPO investors threw in the towel on **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) after it gave up a basing effort and slumped into a deepening correction in February last year. It rallied for a few weeks through early May, then dived again, leading many to nix the stock from their watch lists.


But Facebook quietly formed a symmetrical, six-month, double-bottom base. It broke out past a 29.17 buy point with a 31% gain in a single week in July 2013.


**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) formed an awkward double-bottom base from August to October 2013. But compared with the roughshod consolidation the biotech had carved over the prior nine months, the double bottom was a thing of beauty.


The base began to form with the down week ended Aug. 9 **(1)**. Shares climbed the right side of the first cup with tight weekly closes, suggesting institutional support. The stock regained its 10-week moving average, rallied for a few more weeks and got as high as 118.29. Then it dropped hard for its second shakeout.


Another key chart point here is the week ended Oct. 18. The stock posted only a fractional loss for the week **(2)**, showing it holding its ground in heavy trade.


Shares started lower the following week, rebounding from support at their 200-day line. Shares then bolted 15% higher from Oct. 23 to 25, clearing the 118.39 buy point (a dime above the middle peak) in heavy trade.


The company's earnings and sales were growing nicely. Alexion gained 57% in four months.

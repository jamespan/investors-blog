**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was a top stock of 2015, gaining as much as 121% as sales and profits rebounded. But you probably wouldn't have believed it the way the year started for the e-commerce giant.

  

On Jan. 1, Amazon had a dismal Composite Rating of 16, meaning that it trailed 84% of stocks tracked by IBD on a wide range of fundamental criteria. Its Earnings Per Share Rating was just 2. An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D indicated heavy selling by the institutional crowd.

  

To make matters worse, its IBD subgroup — Retail-Internet — was ranked No. 163 out of 197.

  

But Amazon's character changed dramatically on April 24 **(1)**, when the stock rocketed out of a long first-stage consolidation on a better-than-expected first-quarter report. Amazon cleared a 408.16 buy point via a gap-up in price en route to a new high. A few days earlier, the stock had cleared an early entry of 389.47 in an eight-week handle that formed on the long base.

  

Amazon lost 12 cents a share, but sales beat the Street's view, up 15% even as the harsh winter froze consumer spending. Analysts also liked a 49% leap in revenue from the Amazon Web Services cloud-computing business.

  

The big gains eased concerns about lackluster holiday sales in 2014 and heavy spending on new business initiatives.

  

After its breakout, Amazon immediately began work on an 11-week flat base that featured attractively tight trading. The stock cleared the 452.75 buy point in heavy volume on July 13 **(2)** and soared 10% on July 24 after it showed earnings of 19 cents a share in Q2 vs. expectations for a loss of 14 cents. The results showed that investments in cloud computing and the Amazon Prime video streaming service were paying off.

  

The stock formed another flat base. After yet another big earnings report, it cleared a new buy point at 580.67 in heavy volume on Oct. 23.

  

By that time, Amazon's IBD fundamentals had improved dramatically. On Oct. 22, the day before the breakout, Amazon boasted a 96 Composite Rating, a 77 EPS and an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B.

  

Amazon accounted for more than a third of this year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday e-commerce spend, according to Slice Intelligence. Its Black Friday [sales](http://news.investors.com/technology/120215-783383-cyber-monday-set-holiday-shopping-record.htm) rose 23% vs. a year earlier.

  

Since its April 24 breakout past a 408.16 entry, the [Leaderboard stock](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) has so far produced a nearly 68% gain.

  In A Good Base, Gap-Ups In Price Signal Strong Demand

Some conversations are more positive than others. And what about a base that has formed on a stock's price chart? One way to see it is as nothing but a translated conversation between buyers and sellers.


Sometimes the chatter is negative and uncertain. Other times it is smooth and fluid.


Bases generally form around decisions and big moves made by institutional investors. Early share-holding investors take profits and liquidate holdings. Incoming institutions pick up shares on the dip and build positions, gradually constraining the float, or the available supply of shares.


While the fundamentals of the stock provide the basic magnetism luring large investors, the gradual reduction of supply in the basing process sets the stage for a breakout and rally.


Meanwhile, a stock's chart sends many minute signals on the status of that process.


One positive sign is gap-ups in strong volume within the base.


Sometimes these take place at a weekly level, but generally you need to look over price-and-volume action on a daily chart to get such cues.


A gap-up is when one day or week's trading begins at a higher level than the highest mark posted in the previous session or week. This distance leaves a gap on price-bar charts and generally shows enthusiastic support for a stock, although in some cases that gap in price gets filled by the day or week's end.


Gap-ups within bases are especially hard to come by on weekly charts. **Cirrus Logic** ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) gapped up in a base prior to a breakout during the week ended Dec. 19, 2014. Daily charts are a different story, offering a granular read on the stock-basing conversation.


In a 19-week cup base begun in mid-October 1997, **Nokia** ([NOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOK)) staged multiple gap-up moves. On the base's left side, the stock gapped up 4% in huge trade on Dec. 4 **(1)**, then jumped 6% in light yet rising trade on Dec. 29 **(2)**.


The Finnish cellphone maker also scored a 7% gap-up on Jan. 14, 1998, and jumped 6% in heavy trade on Jan. 28 **(3)**. The piece de resistance was an 11% surge in massive trade on Feb. 12 **(4)**.


That sharp rise could have prompted a buy point for aggressive traders. But the base was 38% deep, so one could have waited for the stock to gain more ground and round out its base. In mid-March, Nokia cleared a handle at 52.10 in rising volume and ran up 931% to a June 2000 peak.

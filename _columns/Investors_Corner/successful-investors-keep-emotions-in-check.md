  Curbing Emotions Is Key To Successful Investing

Warren Buffett once advised investors to "be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful."


In investing, emotions — such as greed, fear, hope and denial — rule the market.


The most successful investors prevent their emotions from dictating their decisions. Those who fail in that task often end up buying high and selling low, or buying low and selling lower, or refraining from buying when the time is right.


This is the first in a series of columns aimed at helping you understand and gauge investor psychology to help you keep your emotions in check.


Story topics include ways to prevent hope, fear and greed from causing you to make trading mistakes. Other columns will address how denying mistakes can lead to big losses, how to evaluate your own psychology and how to prevent your ego from getting damaged by a shakeout or a failed breakout.


IBD is the only newspaper in America — and maybe the world — that publishes numerous gauges of investor sentiment each day. They provide clues as to when investors have become too bullish or too bearish.


Indicators such as the put-call volume ratio and the Investors Intelligence bulls vs. bears survey appear in the "Making Money" section (today on B2 and B11). These can help you determine when the market is getting close to a top or a bottom.


When these indicators skew toward the extremes in bullish or bearish sentiment, you should be on alert for a key market turn and make adjustments accordingly.


For example, you may want to be cautious about making any new purchases when the sentiment indicators show excessive bullishness. If everyone is upbeat, who else can become new buyers? Conversely, periods of excessive bearishness are good times to burnish your watch lists of stocks to buy when the market turns up.


Sentiment gauges are merely secondary indicators. They should be used only in conjunction with primary indicators, the price and volume action of the major indexes.


Investors should heed the advice of famed investor Jesse Livermore, who once said that "to be consistently successful, an investor or speculator must have rules to guide him." IBD's CAN SLIM [system](http://education.investors.com/) provides that set of rules to help you buy and sell stocks properly. These guidelines will help you keep your emotions in check and resist the temptation to react to the latest headlines or a mere flashy move in a stock.

**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

It can be great when you catch a leader breaking out from an early-stage base pattern. It's dangerous to buy a breakout if a stock has already had a long, steep run. Breakouts from late-stage bases will often blow up. So always look and think twice before making a decision to buy.

  

It's usually best to buy when a stock breaks out from a first-stage or second-stage base.

  

You need to be more careful after that. Stocks can run for many months after breaking out. As a rally lengthens, the trade gets riskier. You need to be ready to exit the stock and lock in gains.

  

If the stock's fundamentals are good but not great, even an early-stage base could fail. So a weak breakout is a key sell signal.

  

When you examine a stock's chart, first note what stage base it's in. Pull up a weekly chart and eyeball how much a stock has moved after breaking out from a base. A breakout needs to produce a gain of at least 20% in order to be counted as one stage.

  

If the gain is less than 20% and the stock forms another base, it's a base-on-base pattern and counted as one stage.

  

An alternative way to identify what stage of base a stock is in is to use the pattern recognition feature at IBD's sister service [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com), which requires a separate subscription.

  

No matter what stage the pattern, look for signs of sloppy or big-swinging price action. Avoid bases that display these traits.

  

Price action that's calm and constructive tends to make for a better base â€” be it first stage or fourth stage. Institutional holders are in no hurry to sell hard.

  

In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote, "Sell when your stock makes a new high in price off a third- or fourth-stage base. The third time is seldom a charm in the market. By then, an advancing stock has become too obvious, and almost everyone sees it."

  

**Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) built a series of bases and had a monster advance from its November 2008 low. The stock zoomed from 5 a share to 111 by the time it started a faulty, fifth-stage consolidation on Aug. 4, 2011.

  

The pattern had a few weeks of wide and loose trading, a no-no. Keurig cleared a 111.52 buy point in the week ended Sept. 16. It eked out a new high, but reversed to trigger the 8% sell rule in the week ended Sept. 23 **(1)**. Shares plunged 71% by Nov. 11 **(2)**.

  Five Investing Pitfalls To Avoid In A Down Market

You found a company with a new, innovative product. Strong demand was fueling big earnings and sales growth. Mutual fund sponsorship was top-notch, and the stock was in a bullish technical pattern.


But the stock went lower soon after you bought it because you were wrong about the direction of the general market.


Mistakes are plentiful during a market downtrend. Avoid these common ones, and you'll be able to keep your hard-earned cash intact.


• **Buying before a base completes.** During the recent market pullback, many stocks pulled down to their 200-day moving averages and found support. To some traders, long-term support was a buying opportunity.


The key to making money in the market, though, is waiting until a base completes before buying. In most cases, stocks that come down to their 200-day lines do so amid signs of institutional selling. Make the stock prove itself more, and look for signs of institutional buying as the stock builds the right side of the base. Then you have a legitimate base.


• **Buying every possible breakout.** Bullish stock charts tempt investors all the time during down markets. Some growth names will hang in there with compelling charts.


A breakout may work for a while, but it will likely be short-lived. While stocks that hold up the best during down markets can go on to be the next leaders, they still should not be bought during a downtrend.


• **Staying married to a stock or even averaging down.** A stock trades at 100 a share. Your cost basis is 100. The stock heads lower, and you buy an equal amount of shares at 80, lowering your cost basis to 90. The problem is that you're averaging down in a former leader that's under tremendous institutional selling pressure.


This is how serious damage is done to a portfolio. It rarely makes sense to buy a stock that has the potential to spiral lower before finally hitting a bottom.


• **Buying low P-E stocks.** Price-to-earnings ratios are a common valuation tool on Wall Street. Expensive stocks can become cheap, but cheap stocks become cheaper in a down market. Trying to catch a stock "on sale" is fraught with risk.


In many cases, stocks with low P-E ratios are suffering from weak fundamentals, where shrinking market share results in lower earnings and earnings growth. That's not something you want to see in a stock. Remember, some of the best merchandise in the stock market often sells at a pricey valuation due to strong fundamentals and bullish growth prospects.


• **Stop paying attention.** It's easy to lose interest when stocks are selling off, but market downdrafts let high-quality names take a breather and eventually build new bases.


When a new uptrend is confirmed (see The Big Picture [column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) and Market Pulse in Wednesday's IBD), breakouts deliver the biggest gains. During a market pullback, try hard to make a list of stocks that held up the best. A few will show limited signs of distribution (heavy selling by funds) on the way down and accumulation (institutional buying) on the way up. Focus on the most resilient names with the least amount of technical damage. They will generally be your best prospects.

With a little more than three months to go in the year, **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) is no doubt one of the top stocks of 2019, surging more than 137% from a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) to a peak price of 176.55.




And it all started with a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), one of the [bullish chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) that the biggest stock market winners form at the start of their rallies.


Ahead of the stock's [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) on May 9, there were a significant number of clues that Roku could be a big winner, including "skyscrapers" of accumulation.


How To Invest: 'Skyscrapers' Of Accumulation
--------------------------------------------


"Skyscrapers" of accumulation — a term coined by Scott O'Neil, CEO of IBD parent company Data Analysis Inc. — point to big price increases in unusually heavy trading volume. An easy way to discern such ferocious demand from hedge funds, mutual funds, banks, insurers and the like on an [IBD weekly chart](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/)? Spot the tall volume bars, painted in blue when a stock rises for the day or week, as the stock forms its [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ICroku093019-300x161.jpg)The week ended Jan. 11 showed a true skyscraper: a 17.3% price advance by Roku shares on a volume increase of 176% vs. the 10-week moving average **(1)**.


Next, the week ended Feb. 22 displayed a near-24% price surge on 47% higher-than-average turnover **(2)**.


In all, at least half a dozen weeks on the right side of Roku's [well-made base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) showed nice gains in above-average trade.


Call that true institutional demand.

Roku's Breakout
---------------


[Roku stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/roku-stock-buy-now/) rammed through a 74.45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on May 9 in an [abnormally deep cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) after [better-than-expected quarterly earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q1-2019-roku-stock/). Another interpretation is a base within a base, as a smaller [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) produced a 71.40 entry.



Either way, the [breakout day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) was May 9. The stock rose to as high as 83.35, up 28%. Volume surged to more than 56 million shares, 335% above its average over the past 50 sessions. This indicated strong institutional demand even as shares hit record highs. Remember, institutions don't buy a stock just to flip it a few days later; they are normally looking to hold the stock for a number of quarters, if not longer.


Keep in mind, Roku stock bore additional risks. The company has scored big revenue growth, yet lost 8 cents per share in 2018. Analysts also expect the company to continue its money-losing ways with a net loss of 50 cents per share this year and 41 cents in 2020.


On a technical basis, the cup's depth exceeded 50%, eventually bottoming out with a 66% decline from peak to trough. In the vast majority of good cup-with-handle bases, the depth should not exceed 30% to 33%. However, during the throes of a bear market — like the fourth quarter of 2018 — it can be acceptable for a deeper-than-usual formation.


Roku's Potential Sell Signals
-----------------------------



In early September, the chart gave a number of clues that the stock's price was overheating. On the Sept. 6 close, Roku stock was nearly 125% above its long-term 200-day line. A stock is getting overheated when it rises more than [100% above the long-term moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-stock-how-far-does-it-rise-above-the-200-day-line/). While that indicator is not a sell signal by itself, you should be on the lookout for additional sell signals to help lock in gains.


On Sept. 20, the stock [plunged through its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in huge turnover after Pivotal Research Group [initiated coverage with a sell rating](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-stock-dives-below-key-support-level-after-getting-sell-rating/) and 60 price target. The analyst firm called the stock "dramatically overvalued."


Currently, Roku has formed a [new cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) that has wide and loose elements.

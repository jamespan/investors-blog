The N in [IBD's CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/) investment system can stand for new products, new services or new management. The N also stands for new issues or [initial public offerings (IPOs)](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) that are so strong that they go on to reach new highs.

  

Just as new toys can bring children happiness, new issues that come to market can bring investors joy. Some IPOs have gone on to become huge stock market winners. They include **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) in the 1980s, **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) in the 1990s and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) (formerly known as Google) in the 2000s.

  

While IPOs have the potential to be big-time winners, they can also bring pain if not dealt with properly.

  

New issues come about as companies sell shares of themselves to raise funds; venture capital firms use the IPO to exit their investment.

  

Some new IPOs are little-known firms. Others already have exciting products or services in the market that many people know well. These IPOs may bring about much anticipation, but this is not always a good sign. The swan dives by e-commerce giant **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and wearable camera maker **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) prove it.

  

While new issues can bring about large gains in a short amount of time, they can be very volatile. This is especially the case in the first few days or weeks of becoming public. They can also be quite volatile after the initial few weeks. Just look at the burger chain **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)).

  

There's also no past price-and-volume action or moving averages to help you key in on where to buy or trading behavior to study.

  

So that's why IBD recommends against blindly jumping into the fray and putting yourself at risk for large swing. Put your buying plans on hold; let the stock settle down and form an IPO base, which can be shorter than normal.

  

An IPO base is a consolidation that forms shortly after the stock's debut. It's generally between two weeks and five weeks in length but can be as short as seven days, in contrast to a minimum of five weeks for a flat base.

  

The correction in an IPO base tends to be less than 20%; but for more volatile issues, the correction can be as deep as 50%. For highly detailed information on the specific trading rules for IPOs, check out IBD's [IPO Trading Strategies home study program](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/ipo-trading-strategies/).

  

Check out the [IPO Analysis column](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm) in the B section of Tuesday and Thursday's IBD. This feature will focus on actionable setups or point you to glowing fundamentals in top new issues that have gone public in recent years. You can also study up to 16 minicharts with concise analysis on each stock's recent price action.

  

For an in-depth look at upcoming new issues, see the New Issues America page in IBD's A section. This feature, which occasionally replaces [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm), will give you the scoop on innovative firms that are soon going public. The column explains exactly what the company does as well as risks and challenges.

  

On the same page, you'll also find a chart that compares the performance of new issues with the S&P 500, plus a small table that shows the performance of a few recent new issues.

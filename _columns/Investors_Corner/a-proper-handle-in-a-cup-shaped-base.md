Learning to recognize and read the correct stock chart patterns (IBD calls them "bases") is, among other things, a process of assessing risk. Many [stock bases](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786&nav=IBDUCourse5) come with one or more flaws. This means their length, depth or some other element falls short of the rules that IBD research has shown characterize the bases that preceded many of the stock market's biggest winners.

  

Among the most important and easiest elements to gauge is the position of the handle within a cup-with-handle base.

  

The rule says the midpoint price of the handle must be above the midpoint of the left-side decline of the overall base.

  

This simply means that the mathematical halfway point between the highest and lowest marks of the handle must be higher than the halfway point between the base's left-side high and its lowest price.

  

Consider the recent base built by **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)). Using a daily chart, you can see the stock marked the left-side high of the pattern at 70.48 on Feb. 20.

  

The [Israel-based security software developer](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/042815-749993-cyberark-focuses-on-protecting-privileged-accounts-inside-enterprise-networks.htm) hit a low of 47.51 on March 16. Add these two numbers together, divide by two and you get a midpoint of 58.99.

  

The handle started with a left-side high of 62.98 on April 8 and ended with a low of 56.87 on April 14. Add them and divide by two. This tells you the handle midpoint is 59.92, above the overall base's 58.99.

  

This shows the handle is in a healthy position. The stock formed its handle after spending enough time building the right side of the base as institutional demand for the stock grew.

  

You can stack the numbers like this:

  

70.48 | 62.98

  

47.51 | 56.87

  

58.99 | 59.92

  

Plot your buy point by adding a dime to the handle's left-side high. In this case, that's 62.98, so the buy point is 63.08.

  

**Ulta Beauty's** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) recent yearlong base's left side high started at 132.72 in November 2013. It hit a low of 80.35 in January. The handle started with a 121.43 high in the week ended Sept. 26. It dipped 12% in four weeks, to a 106.87 low.

  

Adding the base's high and low and dividing by two gives you a midpoint of 106.53. Do the same for the handle and you get a midpoint of 114.15, plenty high enough to make the buy point valid at 121.53.

  

The number grid looks like this:

  

132.72 | 121.43

  

80.35 | 106.87

  

106.53 | 114.15

  

A handle or buy point that is slightly low can sometimes work. But the breakout will carry added risk of a breakdown.

  

In any case, you'd like your breakout to come with a big gain in strong volume.

  

Also, a correct midpoint for your handle does not assume the base's other characteristics are in order. The base's total decline, top to bottom, should generally be less than 35%. If it has a handle, the base itself should be at least seven weeks long from left-side high to breakout.

  

The handle itself should be no more than 8%-12% deep in a normal [market uptrend](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm), and you'd really like to see it drifting lower in dwindling trade. Rising or volatile trade in the handle, and a handle that wedges higher rather than lower, are potent flaws.

The IPO market isn't dead.

In 2014, there were 363 filings of new initial public offerings, a multiyear high and up 42% from 2013. This year, recent data from Renaissance Capital showed 96 filings so far this year, compared to 234 in 2015.

While filings surely have not been as robust lately, there have been plenty of winners in recent months.Â **Acacia Communications** ([ACIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACIA)) has been a big winner since its May debut at 23. Same with **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), which came public in June at 15.

Of course, it's great to latch onto an IPO in the early stages of its move, but IPOs shouldn't be bought willy-nilly. Certain things need to looked at, and rules need to be followed.

For starters, an IPO should never be bought on the first day or two of trading. Initial euphoria can be met by selling soon after, so it's important to let the dust settle. Otherwise, an ill-timed buy could result in a "hold and hope" strategy which often leads to dead money.

IPOs that tell a good story but with no earnings and sales should be avoided.

When it comes to technical analysis, an IPO base can be shorter than a typical base, which usually needs a minimum of five weeks to form.

Small cap **Cotiviti** ([COTV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COTV)) cleared a short three-week base with a 20.10 buy point soon after its May IPO at 19. It hasn't looked back. Twilio, meanwhile, cleared a 44.90 buy point when shares surged 28% in the week ended Aug. 12.

In rare cases, some good IPO bases can be very short, forming over 5-10 days.

IPOs also need to be looked at a bit differently from a fundamental standpoint as well. Some IPOs, for example, have only a few quarters of positive earnings under their belt; others might not be profitable yet, but they're right on the verge of profitability thanks to consistently strong sales growth. See Twilio. But this is rather the exception, not the rule. You'd prefer to see big earnings increases occur _before_ a breakout, not afterward.

IBD investors learn to look for high return on equity and profit margin when evaluating a stock. But again, IPOs that aren't profitable will be light in these areas. As a result, the stock's Composite Rating or Earnings Per Share Rating often won't measure up. Some IPOs won't have an SMR Rating (see it at [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)) because there is no measurable ROE (return on equity) yet.

Whenever possible, target IPOs with a proven track record of earnings and sales growth. Acacia presented a pretty clear growth story when it debuted in May at 23. In its first report as a publicly traded company, earnings growth accelerated from the prior quarter, soaring 376%. Sales growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 101% to \$116.2 million.

**Penumbra** ([PEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PEN)), **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Amplify Snack Brands** ([BETR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BETR)), **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) are all trading near proper buy points.

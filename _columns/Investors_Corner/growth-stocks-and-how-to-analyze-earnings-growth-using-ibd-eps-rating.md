  Growth Stocks And How To Analyze Earnings Growth: Using IBD's EPS Rating

Growth stocks and rising earnings go hand in hand. That doesn't mean that only stocks with rising earnings growth see huge price increases. Likewise, it doesn't mean that all stocks that stage big price rallies show accelerating earnings growth.




However, it does mean that one of the best ways for investors to reduce risk, and increase the chance of booking a gain on a stock breaking out past a [valid buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), is to verify that company earnings are rising, or at least stable.


A quick way to gauge earnings strength is by using IBD's Earnings Per Share Rating, commonly called the EPS Rating. Essentially every stock that trades on the NYSE or Nasdaq gets the rating, which takes a company's two most recent year-over-year changes in quarterly earnings, and the profit of the past three to five years, then compares those results with the thousands of stocks in IBD's database.


The strongest possible rating is a 99 â€” meaning earnings are growing faster than 99% of all other companies. Leading stocks typically carry EPS Ratings of 80 or better. But there are exceptions.


Growth Stocks: Putting The EPS Rating To Use
--------------------------------------------


Companies recovering from financial lapses will often bounce back from losses, or from declining earnings growth. The EPS Rating treats these cases favorably.



EPS Ratings can be found at [IBD's Stock Quotes page](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-the-trade-desk-inc-cl-a-ttd.htm?fromsearch=1), as well as [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-the-trade-desk-inc-cl-a-ttd.aspx) and the [IBD Smart NYSE and Nasdaq Tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-may-20-2020/).


Generally, a strong EPS Rating points out a stock that is a steady performer, usually with irresistible products or services, excellent cost structure and savvy management. If you look carefully at the quarterly results, you can find growth stocks that have both top-shelf EPS ratings *and* accelerating earnings growth. A few names fitting that description after Q1 of 2020 included **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) and **Focus Financial** ([FOCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOCS)).


Even with names showing those dual strengths, investors need to keep their ears tuned. Analyst estimates for coming quarters do not figure into EPS Ratings. Neither do changes in company guidance. For this reason, growth stocks may see their rallies start to flag before the EPS Rating weakens.


This is one key reason that investors are advised to "buy on fundamentals, [sell on technicals](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/)." This means that earnings, profit margins, revenue growth and other fundamental signals cue investors as to [when to buy a stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). A gradual weakening of technical traits, as seen in stock price and volume behavior, tend to provide the earliest messages on when to exit even the best growth stocks.

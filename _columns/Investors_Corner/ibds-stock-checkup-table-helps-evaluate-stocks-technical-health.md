To many new investors, technical analysis seems a bit like witchcraft — a magical skill that can’t really be trusted.


But investors who learn to analyze a stock’s technical strength together with its fundamentals have a big advantage.


“It’s not enough to buy a stock simply because it has good fundamental characteristics, like strong earnings and sales,” wrote IBD founder William J. O’Neil in “How to Make Money In Stocks.” “Fortunes are made every year by those who take the time to learn to interpret charts properly.”


The Stock Checkup, located under the “Research” tab at investors.com, doesn’t discuss charts per se, but it offers technical indicators that can be used with charts to give investors a sense of a stock’s health.

Stock Checkup is comprised of three sections — Market Direction, Fundamental Performance And Technical Performance. The first part of the technical section deals with stock price and volume to help you gauge whether institutional investors are buying or selling a stock.


The Relative Strength Rating indicates how a stock has been performing relative to the rest of the market over the past 52 weeks. Each stock is assigned an RS Rating of between 1 and 99, with 99 indicating that a stock is outperforming 99% of all listed companies. Focus on stocks with RS Ratings of at least 80.


The Accumulation/Distribution Rating tracks the degree of institutional buying (accumulation) and selling (distribution) over the past 13 weeks. It too is a barometer of a stock’s strength. An Acc/Dis Rating below C indicates distribution; above C points to accumulation.


Investors should avoid Nasdaq stocks that trade below 15 a share and NYSE stocks trading below 20 because they tend to be illiquid and more speculative. An average volume of less than 500,000 shares per day is a sign of less institutional interest in the stock, unless the stock is high in price.


After checking these indicators, now go to a chart. See where a stock is in relation to its 50-day moving average and its 52-week high. Stocks hitting new highs that are far above their 50-day lines could be near a top. But those getting support at the 50-day line just below their 52-week highs could be getting set to clear a buy point. Stocks trading sharply below their 50-day lines reflect weakness.


The technical indicators of many former top growth stocks have turned negative amid the market’s correction. That’s not surprising, since growth stocks can fall up to 2.5 times as fast as the rest of the major indexes.


Some defensive names are showing relative strength right now. Packaged food giant **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)), trades around 5% above its 50-day moving average; hence, a green dot next to that criterion in Stock Checkup means it passes the grade. Campbell is just off a 52-week high as it works on a flat base with a 55.18 buy point.


The steady dividend payer boasts an RS Rating of 94; hence, the Stock Checkup gives it another green dot. An Acc/Dis rating of C indicates a net balance of buying and selling by the big funds.

 Most institutions, as well as individual investors, hesitate to buy stocks at new highs. Everyone likes a good discount, so they wait for a pullback.
The 10-week moving average serves as a key area of potential support. Why? Institutions will use that moving average to add shares to existing positions. Use this investing behavior to your own advantage.


To form the 10-week moving average, drawn only on a weekly stock chart, first add up the weekly closing prices over the past 10 weeks and divide by 10. After each Friday, a new 10-week average is calculated, thus creating the line.


A rising 10-week line is positive, pointing to an upward trend in the stock's price. A downward sloping line indicates a stock is in a downtrend.


While the first two to three pullbacks to the 10-week line are considered proper to buy, the very first pullback to the 10-week line following a leading stock's strong breakout can provide the most compelling opportunity to acquire more shares, or even initiate a position if you missed the initial breakout from an excellent base. Make sure you buy a smaller amount of shares than your initial position, such as 20% or 30% of your beginning stake. You want to average up slowly in price, not swiftly.


Check out **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), one of the biggest market winners during the 2014-2015 time frame. The stock provided three separate classic situations in which to buy the stock.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IC032717-1024x544.png)First, the stock broke out of a proper double-bottom base with a 72.60 entry on May 29, 2014. Notice how the second leg undercut the first leg of the pattern, shaking out weak holders before moving higher.


Following the stock's breakout, the stock quietly formed a five-week flat base with an 85.88 buy point as the market underwent a brief period of weakness. Palo Alto's relative strength line remained near new high territory. The breakout occurred on Aug. 13, 2014.


Finally, months later in October, the first 10-week pullback occurred as shares fell back to the 10-week line **(1)**. While the stock fell under the 10-week average during the week, it recovered strongly to end the week on a high note.


Over the next nine months, Palo Alto would rise 176% to its ultimate peak at 200.55 from its double-bottom breakout. The 10-week line remained a steadfast support level throughout the move. When the top arrived in the summer of 2015, shares finally broke the 50-day line (on a daily chart) and the 10-week line on heavy volume **(2)**, a clear expectation-breaker and character change. The stock fell 45% in seven months.


[MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF2), an IBD company, just released its new Smart Alerts feature that provides both positive and negative alerts: first-time pullbacks to the 10-week moving average and heavy volume breaks of the 50-day line (see it on daily charts).


Not only can you find ideas of stocks meeting these characteristics, but you can input your own watchlists and you'll be alerted when those conditions are met. These features are particularly useful if you can't monitor your positions throughout the day. Add your portfolio into the Smart Alerts list and it'll notify you if one of your holdings is triggering a potential add-on or sell signal


Recently, **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)) and **Primerica** ([PRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRI)) triggered first-pullbacks-to-the-10-week-line after solid breakouts.


 JD.com broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Feb. 8 when shares surpassed the 29.01 entry point. After a 12% advance, shares have pulled back to the 10-week line near 29.86.
Ideally, you should see light volume on the way down, followed by a surge in volume as the stock rebounds, indicating institutions are stepping in to halt the stock's retreat.


 Primerica, a current [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) member, broke out of a flat base with a 73.15 entry on Jan. 13. After a solid 15% move higher, shares have used the recent pause in financials to fall back to the 10-week line where it is currently finding support.
Other leading stocks haven't been so fortunate and have triggered sell signals to the downside.


 **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), the leading maker of recreational vehicles, plummeted nearly 10% on March 7 on its earnings announcement. Not only did shares give back all of their recent gains from a 106.44 cup-with-handle buy point, but they closed sharply below the 50-day line, a clear sell signal. In subsequent days, shares have fallen an additional 9% from the gap-down day.

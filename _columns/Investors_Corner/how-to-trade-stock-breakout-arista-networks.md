You had a good year in the market, following solid rules. You picked companies that truly led their industries. Still, some stocks took off without you and staged rocketlike gains in 2017.









 
 
 How can you boost the odds of finding those superstars next year? Analyze this year's winners. Study how they formed good bases. Check how the market was acting as these bases formed. Then see how the company's earnings and sales grew amid the run.
You always gain something by doing a back-study of a great stock market winner. That's the [IBD way](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/). The concept of historical precedent analysis echoes throughout all of IBD's stock market coverage. It gives you an edge on Wall Street.


The elements of an [outstanding flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) do not change from bull market to bull market. **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) cleared a five-week flat base during the week ended Nov. 18, 2016, just days after the historic U.S. elections that year. The [Sector Leader](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) produced a bountiful gain of 180%. The S&P 500 rose 22.8% over the same time frame. Here are some of the major positives of that flat base.

What about a new IPO? Gauge the gain from the initial pricing to the current price. Is it up substantially? Google operator **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) ran up 33% after its August 2004 debut at 85 a share. Then it built the [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/many-tech-ipos-can-fail-on-their-first-breakout-just-like-emc-did-in-1986/) by which all future IPOs should be judged.


Two: Few big weeks down in price. Arista needed only five weeks, the minimum required, to craft a [good flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). Arista dropped 5.5% in the first week **(1)**. Not severe. Volume was light. Total correction within the entire base: just 10%.


Three: Look for heavy institutional support. Find evidence that mutual funds, pensions, banks and insurers take advantage of dips, scooping shares. In the week ended Nov. 4, see Arista's bounce off the lows? Nice close in the upper half of the week's range **(2)**. At 83.31, it closed just a dime below the 10-week line.


Four: Does a stock have solid ratings? Arista did.


Five: Does real volume come in at the breakout, or soon after? It did for Arista.


On Nov. 14, turnover jumped 79% above the 50-day average of 665,000 shares. On Nov. 21, volume ballooned 237% above normal as shares soared 7%. In early 2017, Arista built a new flat base **(3)**, then rallied again.

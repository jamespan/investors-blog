Spotting a cup-with-handle base in a fundamentally strong stock doesn't mean your work is over.

The disciplined investor will run through a checklist. If the stock doesn't pass the test, it's best to move on to the next possibility.

Here's a list of questions:

• **Is the market in a confirmed uptrend?** Without an uptrending market, you don't have the right environment for a breakout to work. It's best to buy when the market is rewarding the bulls.

• **Does the stock show a prior uptrend?** This is a tough one if you are inclined to look for bargains. The disciplined investor doesn't try to buy a stock at the cheapest price. The goal is to open a position when it is likeliest to work. If a stock doesn't show a 30% prior uptrend, or 20% climb from a previous breakout, the chance of success isn't good. So always check the chart action left of the cup base.

• **Is the base late-stage?** A first- or second-stage base has a much better chance of success than later- stage bases. Occasionally you find a stock — like **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) or **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) — that has made progress out of a later-stage base. But if you buy from a late-stage breakout, be aware of the odds.

• **Is the base long enough?** A cup-with-handle base should take shape over at least seven weeks. Most last three to six months, but some form over a year or more. If you hope to spot the longer cups, you will have to get in the habit of looking at the weekly chart. If you only look at daily charts, you could miss the longer cup.

• **Is the base too deep?** Most stocks correct 20% to 30% during a normal consolidation. In major bear markets, a cup base may correct as much as 50%. A base that corrects too much is facing a mountain of overhead — i.e., investors who bought during the base's left-side decline and are eager to sell near their break-even mark.

• **Is the action in the base wide and loose, or is it tight?** Tight trading shows institutional support. A base with wide-and-loose action is prone to failure.

• **Does the base show accumulation?** Look for up weeks in strong volume, gap-ups within the base and support at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

• **Is the cup's handle properly formed?** A handle should last at least a week and drift downward less than 12%. In severe markets, the handle may fall 20% to 30%. The volume should dry up. The handle should form in the upper half of the cup, within 15% of the left-side high, and should form above the stock's 10-week moving average.

Handles with lows that wedge upward are defective.

The buy point in a cup with handle is the highest price in the handle plus 10 cents. Look for volume at least 40% above the stock's average as shares clear the buy point.

Birds fly in flocks. Fish swim in schools. Wolves hunt in packs.

Stocks move in industry groups.

Hard to believe?

Research shows that "37% of a (leading) stock's price movement is directly tied to performance of the industry group," IBD Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

IBD research also shows that an additional 12% of a winning stock's price move is owing to the industry sector. That means that nearly 50% of a winning stock rally's strength borrows from the stock's industry and economic sector.

Industries can also move on new economic trends, such as housing and retail gains driven by recovering consumer spending. It may also be a significant structural shift or technical advance within an industry.

This might be shale gas and oil development, or advanced safety technology on new automobiles. You can follow industry trends by reading the daily [Industry Themes](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-industry-themes/) columns in IBD and at Investors.com.

The biotech and ethical drug industry produced a welter of leading stocks in the 2012-2015 period.

![ic_regn_121316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IC_regn_121316.png)Smaller biomedical firms saw an influx of investment from Big Pharma as the industry saw a historic lapse of patent protection on aging blockbuster drugs.

Larger firms found themselves needing to bulk up to compete. Many seized on overseas acquisitions. Some shifted their headquarters overseas in order to sidestep U.S. tax burdens.

When **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) broke out of a four-month cup base in April 2013 (see chart), the stock already had been climbing for four years. But Tarrytown, N.Y.-based Regeneron only managed to pull its earnings growth together through 2012.

Some of its prior bases were volatile and produced numerous pullbacks. Yet, by April 2013, its Composite and RS ratings were best-possible 99s.

The Medical Sector ranked No. 17 among 33 economic sectors tracked by IBD and listed in the daily IBD Smart NYSE & Nasdaq Tables. That was down from a No. 7 position in January.

But of the 15 groups within that sector, Medical-Biomedical/Biotech ranked No. 14 — one of two medical groups within the top 20. IBD had also shown that the group had climbed from a No. 33 group ranking in January, posting a 19% year-to-date gain.

You can track the movement of all 197 industry groups by going to the "Stock Lists" section at Investors.com, clicking on "IBD Data Tables," and then choosing "Industry Sub-Group Rankings." In IBD Weekly, the Top 40 Groups list forms part of the "What's The Market Trend?" page (usually on B8), and the entire table is also published in the second section of the newspaper.

Investors who bought Regeneron shares at the April 2013 breakout would have logged a 178% gain through June of 2015.

**IBD'S TAKE**: _To find stocks that may be breaking out or on the verge of doing so, go to the [Stocks On The Move](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx) table, updated in real time at Investors.com. You can see the table right on the home page or by going to the "Stock Lists" section. Focus on stocks with strong EPS and RS ratings that are rising in above-average turnover._

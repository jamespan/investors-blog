The L in IBD's [CAN SLIM stock investment system](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) is a simple yet vital concept.

It stands for Leaders: high-growth stocks with the greatest potential for outstanding returns.

True market leaders are typically the best performers in top-tier industry groups or sectors. They boast strong profit and revenue growth, generate unique or innovative products and services, and receive solid institutional support.

"The top one, two or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir," wrote IBD [chairman and founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=A011BMT&nav=IBDUWorkshops) in his best-seller "How to Make Money in Stocks."

Some investing systems emphasize buying stocks that have been beaten down, implying that they're undervalued and therefore ready to rebound. But CAN SLIM investors focus on stocks that are showing strength as they break out of properly formed bases and hit new highs.

If the overall [stock market is trending higher](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) , and you buy at a proper buy point, you have a strong chance of making money quickly with the top stocks. Volume as the stock breaks out of its base is key, as heavy volume indicates that the stock is being driven higher by mutual funds and other high-powered investors.

Top growth stocks that seemingly came out of nowhere to break out and rack up huge gains for investors include computer networking king **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) in October 1990, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in March 2004 and search engine pioneer **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) in September 2004. The table that accompanies this story shows a sample of today's leading stocks. They include drugmaker **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)), shoemaker **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and medical device maker **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)).

Leading stocks come from the top 40 of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks (see page B2 for a partial list). An industry group may have more than one leader, but investors should restrict their watch lists to no more than the top two or three.

Leaders should have [quarterly earnings](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/766086-how-to-buy-stocks.htm) and sales growth of 25%, 50% or more. [Annual profits](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/766269-what-is-annual-earnings-growth.htm) should be similar. They should also have robust financial profiles that include solid margins, profit estimates and long-term growth.

A leading stock tends to hold a [Relative Price Strength Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) of at least 80 out of 99, indicating that the stock's price performance ranks it in the top 15% off all stocks over the past 52 weeks. Stocks whose shares are falling usually indicate that their fundamentals are deteriorating. The top mutual fund managers may in fact be exiting out of the stock.

An easy way to find the outstanding leaders is to check the Sector Leaders table, today on Page B1.

Investing in growth stocks, no matter how good their fundamentals or chart patterns, always comes with risks. For example, when a market correction hits, leading stocks can fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times more than the general market.

Also, after lengthy uptrends, some leaders maintain high ratings from IBD even though they're in late-stage price runs. Prefer leaders when they're breaking out of early-stage bases over those breaking out after huge price runs.

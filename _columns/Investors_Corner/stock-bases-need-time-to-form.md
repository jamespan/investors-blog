When grandma's recipe for pot roast calls for four hours of cooking time, don't turn off the heat after only two or three hours. You won't wind up with something that grandma used to make.

Don't mess with a recipe that's tried and true. It's the same thing for chart patterns. Many investors want to be ahead of the game. They buy before a pattern actually completes.

Yes, sometimes, it's smart to try to get ahead. But in almost all cases, getting ahead can backfire.

When a stock consolidates for four weeks and pulls 10% off its high, don't call it a [flat base](http://education.investors.com/faq.aspx?nav=IBDUAsk) â€” it is not. It might be down the road, but not now.

In investing, you need to follow rules. Chart patterns have defined characteristics. IBD research has found that good chart patterns require a certain minimum amount of time to form.

A cup should be at least six completed weeks in length. If it breaks out two days before six weeks are up, it's still not a cup base. In most cases, start counting from the first down week on the weekly chart.

A cup-with-handle formation should be at least seven weeks. Seven weeks is also the minimum time requirement for a double-bottom base. The flat base takes the least amount of time to complete. It only needs five weeks.

Don't get bogged down in questioning why a certain pattern takes seven weeks, while another needs only five weeks to complete. It's just the way they have worked out over time. Just look through the numerous examples of big stock market winners in "How To Make Money In Stocks," or in Wednesday's column, "How To Find & Own America's Greatest Opportunities."

New issues can be big movers and IT services provider **Kanbay International** ([KBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBAY)) was one when it went public in July 2004 and began trading around 15. The stock more than doubled before settling into its first pattern.

Kanbay jumped to a high of 30.94 in mid-November that year, then fell 19% in the space of just six days. In the week ended Dec. 3, the stock found support at its 10-week moving average 1, indicating demand was still solid.

The stock went on to consolidate its big gains for five weeks. Although five weeks are enough time for a flat base, Kanbay corrected too much. And it was too short to be a cup. Kanbay cleared a 31.04 buy point Dec. 28 in light trade. It fell more than 8% below that buy point on Jan. 4 2. By March, it fell 41% below its peak.

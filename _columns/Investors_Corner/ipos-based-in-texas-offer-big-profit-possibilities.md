The so-called Texas economic miracle inspires belief or skepticism, depending on who’s singing from the hymnal.


The amen corner can point to the state’s lack of an income tax. Skeptics can point to property taxes, which are higher than 33 states, according to the Tax Foundation.


Stock market investors have a third take on Texas, and it might be worth more money than all the fighting over taxes combined.


The Lone Star state regularly launches an abundance of initial public offerings. Sometimes that leads to breakouts and big price gains.

Texas accounted for 92 of the IPOs, or almost 14%. (Only California had more, 179 or 26% of the total.)


Almost half of the Texas IPOs were in the energy sector. Oil companies are hurting big time now, but two stocks did fairly well before the sector crumbled.


**Sanchez Energy** ([SN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SN)), a December 2011 IPO, had breakouts that brought 25% and 18% gains before the stock headed down with the oil sector.


**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)), an October 2012 IPO, had post-breakout gains of 28%, 63% and 59% before turning south.


Retail played a big role among Texas IPOs in the past five years. Individual investors, though, often needed well-timed entries and sell rules to take advantage.


**Francesca’s** ([FRAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRAN)), a July 2011 IPO, had a 37% gain from a March 2012 breakout, but then became a downward-sloping story.


**Zoe’s Kitchen** ([ZOES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZOES)), a 2014 IPO, stirred speculation that it might become the next **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)). The stock formed some bases, but most led to little upside. The best gain was out of a June 2015 breakout that yielded a 30% profit.


**Dave & Buster’s Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), a 2014 IPO, offered its initial entry in a bounce off the 10-week line in December 2014. The stock logged an 84% gain from the 10-week line.


Other retail IPOs, the debut year and their breakout gains include: **Chuy’s Holdings** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)), 2012, 24% and 26%; and **Michaels Companies** ([MIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIK)), a 2014 IPO, gained 45% from a November 2014 gap up.


Some Texas-based IPOs, such as **La Quinta** ([LQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LQ)), a hotel chain that debuted on the NYSE in 2014, never found the big breakout gain. La Quinta’s breakouts led to modest gains. Others brought mostly frustration. **The Container Store** ([TCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCS)) debuted in 2013 amid lots of financial media attention. The stock formed a short IPO base and gained about 27% after the breakout. However, the overall trend since has been down.


Sometimes a stock will stage several breakouts that go nowhere before getting it right.


After its IPO in November 2013, **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) rose and then offered breakouts **(1)** that led to small gains in January 2014 (not shown on chart), July 2014 and June 2015. In August 2015, a breakout **(2)** led to a 78% gain in four months.

Investors must understand a company's story, from its competitive advantages to any new trends it's riding.


A main goal of IBD's New America section is to give you exactly that story.


Every day, the section — [found here](https://www.investors.com/search/searchresults.aspx?source=filterSearch&Ntt=The+New+America&Nr=OR%28Column%3aThe+New+America%2cEducation%2fHelp+Type%3aThe+New+America%29) — profiles a promising company.


It's often a relatively young, entrepreneurially minded company, but it might be an older name that's turning itself around.


**New Bull Runs, New Winners**


It also could be a very young firm that's just going public. Such profiles appear in some Tuesday editions under a modified section heading: [New Issue America](https://www.investors.com/search/searchresults.aspx?Ntt=New+Issue+America).


Whether the firm is young or old, each article should answer some key questions about the company. For example, what are its key products? Who are the most important customers? How long is the runway for future revenue and earnings growth?


The story also doesn't sugarcoat the company. For example, the article generally will point out some potential stumbling blocks that could end the firm's growth spurt.


The possible challenges could range from new regulations to large competitors with deeper pockets.


The New America section also will periodically run a long list of companies that have recently been featured, so you can see if there's a profile that you missed and want to go back and read.


Some companies put in the New America spotlight never really become big winners in the stock market, but many are able to accomplish that feat.


Last year in October and November — as the market chopped around ahead of its Dec. 20 follow-through that signaled a new uptrend — **Hain Celestial** ([HAIN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAIN)), **Teradata** ([TDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDC)), **Texas Capital Bancshares** ([TCBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TCBI)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) were among the companies featured in New America.


Hain, which produces natural foods and personal-care products, has more than doubled since it was profiled [Nov. 3](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/110211-590240-two-acquisitions-widen-hain-celestials-footprint.htm) **(1**) (monthly chart is shown). Data specialist Teradata is up 42% since its [Oct. 24 New America story](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/102111-588919-teradata-helps-corporations-save-vast-amounts-of-data.htm).


Texas Capital, featured on [Nov. 30](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/112911-593084-texas-capital-adds-jobs-despite-downturn.htm) **(2**) and currently a member of [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/products/default.aspx?id=trial&sec=startsection&src=ablbkd6), has gained about 65% since its article. And athletic apparel maker Under Armour has also risen about 65% since its [Oct. 18 story](http://news.investors.com/business-the-new-america/101811-588444-under-armour-goes-high-tech-with-sportswear.htm).

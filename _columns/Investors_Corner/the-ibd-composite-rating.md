Any good craftsman's workbench offers up indecipherable tools that nevertheless serve a vital purpose.




Once a craftsman learns how to put those specialized tools to use, he becomes more skilled. One of the specialized tools on IBD's workbench is the Composite Rating.


Part of IBD's SmartSelect line of stock ratings, the Composite Rating gives an instant overview of a stock. It combines the [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/), [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/), SMR Rating (which measures sales, margins and return on equity) and Accumulation/Distribution Rating — as well as recent price action — into one gauge. It points a finger toward stocks with strong characteristics.


How To Research Growth Stocks: This Saves Time
----------------------------------------------


Despite this breadth — maybe because of it — it's important to remember that the Composite Rating is just a starting point. It identifies stocks worthy of deeper investigation. Even a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 (1 is the lowest) is never a buy recommendation — at any time.


The highest Composite Rating in the group isn't always the right stock to buy. Do your research and find the proper entry.


You can find Composite Ratings in the mini-charts of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and other stock lists. They are also listed in IBD's [Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-nov-15-2019/), updated every day at [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/).

You can find extra analysis of a stock's Composite Rating by using [Investors.com Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=secondResearchCheckup) function. Why? It will show you the top five Composite-rated peers in a stock's industry group.


You can also go to [key stock lists at Investors.com](http://research.investors.com/screen-center) and click on any of the lists. When the list pops up, go to the "View by" box just below the title. Both the Fundamental and SmartSelect options turn up the Composite Ratings for all stocks on the list.


These well-vetted lists allow you to quickly move past the general focus of the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) into more tightly focused fundamental investigation.


A Starting Point For How To Research Growth Stocks
--------------------------------------------------


Among the first things you'll need to verify are a stock's average daily trading volume and debt levels, two things Composite Ratings do not directly take into account. You will also need to verify that a stock's chart status is constructive.


As an example, check **Toll Bros.** ([TOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TOL)) into IBD Stock Checkup.


The homebuilder on Dec. 6, 2021, showed a solid Composite Rating of 96 on a scale of 1 to 99. Anything above 90, and preferably 95 or higher, is easily in the strike zone. Shares are in buy range from a 67.43 buy point.


Other top Composite Ratings in Toll's homebuilding industry group belonged to **Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)), **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)).


Century at that time was at new highs and extended from a 70.47 buy point. D.R. Horton was extended from the 99.75 buy point of a double bottom. Lennar broke out of a cup with handle Nov. 5, 2021, and was extended. Given a choice, the builders with higher Composite Rating are where you should start your research.

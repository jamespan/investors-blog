Most investors listening to the bearish grumblings of the current market have judiciously pared holdings and raised cash.

  

It's a good time to review your portfolio strategy. When the market finally puts a bottom in place with a follow-through, it will help to have in hand a diagrammed approach to your buying and portfolio goals.

  

When the market follows through, leading stocks often breakout by the handful. The effect can turn investors into kids in a candy store.

  

One way to stay disciplined is to have a clear buying strategy, know how many buys you want to make and how you'd like to manage your portfolio as the rally moves forward.

  

It is also good to have your ultimate goal in mind before you place your first buy order.

  

Goal: "The winning investor's objective should be to have one or two big winners rather than dozens of very small profits," says IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

Smaller investors often have an advantage in this regard. The more capital you have to work with, the more tempting it is to take a lottery-ticket approach and buy into a broad array of breakouts with the goal of improving your odds of landing a winner.

  

But such diversification, O'Neil says, is "plainly and simply often a hedge for ignorance."

  

It's better to do more research ahead of your buys. Focus your watch list on stocks with the most thoroughly solid fundamentals and which are most likely to lead their industries. This should narrow your field of candidates considerably.

  

"The best results are achieved through concentration," O'Neil says, "by putting your eggs in a few baskets that you know well and watching them very carefully."

  

For investors in the \$20,000 to \$200,000 category, this means limiting buying to four or five stocks at the start of a rally. If an excellent new stock shows up on the radar, stay focused: Sell your weakest holding and move that cash into the newbie.

  

O'Neil argues that the best way to diversify is not by building a broad portfolio but by investing over time, through follow-on opportunities. This limits your capital at risk, and keeps you focused in a few, strong stocks on which you are able to keep a close eye.

  

As the rally forges ahead, your goal is to rotate capital out of your slower-moving plays into the clear leaders in your portfolio.

  

By the time the the market turns dicey, your portfolio is trimmed to one, two or three stocks. This allows you to concentrate on their charts, to watch for topping or sell signals, and to carefully manage the way you tend to your holdings.

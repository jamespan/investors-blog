Starting a venture in an age-old industry like food and beverages can seem daunting. Competition is everywhere. But in some niches, such as healthy drinks, your rival can become your mentor, troubleshooter or pro bono consultant. Or all three.

The key? Learn how to communicate your mission honestly and your willingness to learn from others. That's what Mark Reith, co-founder of the energy beverage firm [CHIA/VIE](http://drinkchiavie.com/), did.

• **Admit your ignorance.** In the mid-2000s, Reith excelled in the business of videoconferencing systems as a **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) certified internetwork expert. In order to make the leap to consumer drinks and land on his feet, he openly shared his lack of knowledge and experience with others in the biz.

"If you acknowledge you don't know everything, you end up building a network," Reith told IBD. "Asking lots of questions leads to relationships."

• **Greet the enemy.** Reith says he was surprised at how much he gained from rival healthy drink makers he met at the 2013 Expo West natural products show in Anaheim, Calif., this past March.

Reith noted that he and Camille — his wife and company co-founder — have found that while the industry is "very small, people are very friendly and very helpful to those who are out to do a lot of good and promote growth and healthy living habits."

The CHIA/VIE brand of fruit-based beverages showcases the nutritious value of chia seeds, which are high in omega fatty acid, calcium, manganese and zinc. The Monterey, Calif., firm's Banapple-Berry 75% juice smoothie is particularly full of the popular omega.

CHIA/VIE launched its products in Northern California in the summer of 2011. This year it's expanding into the Golden State's south.

• **Follow your instincts.** Reith points out that listening to veterans in the business doesn't always mean you have to mimic their every move. He didn't know that one typically hires a consultant to find the right path to get a contract with a big retailer. Consultants teach that grocery giants have a specific calendar in which they let beverage producers make a pitch.

Instead, Reith cold-called a local forager of natural food who loved the CHIA/VIE product.

The source began making calls, helping Reith's Bare Nutrition LLC land a large grocer deal to sell in 70 stores across Northern California.

"In hindsight, it was very scary not to know a lot of things," Reith said. "But it's still pretty good to be starting out without preconceived notions. If you naturally look at each problem that comes along, and look at it analytically and logically, you can make a pretty good choice (about what to do)."

• **Commit.** Mark and Camille are CHIA/VIE's sole full-time employees, so naturally they talk about the biz all day. "Work never stops, and that is a bummer," said Camille, who worked for the accounting giant KPMG before becoming an entrepreneur. "But the company is both our baby. We're both in it equally, instead of one person saying, 'OK, enough talking about the business; it's family time now.'"

• **Feel good.** "From Day 1, if our goals were misaligned, it wasn't going to work," Camille said of the startup. "I didn't want to go into a business in which one spouse is supporting the other."

• **Be open.** The CHIA/VIE couple can comment frankly on new business ideas. "You don't have to come up with a politically correct response," Mark said regarding chats with a spouse. "You can just say it's not a good idea, and not have to spend time comforting that person."

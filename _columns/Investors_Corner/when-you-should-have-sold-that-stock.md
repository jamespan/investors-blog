It happens to almost every investor. Your stock keeps running higher and higher. You smugly start thumbing through luxury magazines, looking at yacht ads. The stock takes the latest of several dips. You don't worry. This has happened before â€” it always comes back to make a new high. They're talking about it on TV. All the commentators love it. The analysts love it.


The correction gets deeper, and now you notice the news headlines that the economy is getting a bit soft. There's a sharp build-up of distribution days. Something goes wrong someplace, maybe China, maybe the Middle East, maybe Europe.


The market cracks open.


Now the stock you thought would make you very rich is sinking on big volume. Your big profit dwindles. What was once a huge gain is now a moderate gain.


This is when you look at the chart and say, yes, that price is where I should have sold.


And this is the reason that you need historically validated sell rules. Many investors can buy right, but they don't know when to sell.


IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil has shared decades' worth of studying the charts of winning stocks and the clues that tell the investor when to sell. He's devoted an entire chapter to the topic in his classic book "How To Make Money In Stocks."


Selling a successful position right is often harder than selecting a good stock and buying it. Sell signals can be subtle, and investors are often reluctant to jettison a position that has treated them well.


But there's the flip side: Taking a profit feels good. When you move an unrealized profit to the realized profit column, you know you've locked in a gain, and the market can't take it away.


Some of O'Neil's rules identify how to spot a climax top, which is one of the best things to happen to one of your holdings. A climax occurs after a stock has made a long run upward, then accelerates and gains for a few weeks at a faster rate.


When you spot one, you should sell. Usually, sell into the advance because on the flip side, the stock can come down very fast and is unlikely to recover anytime soon if at all.


**Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), a Chinese web portal, broke out of a classic 42-week cup with handle with a 46.02 entry in September 2010.


The stock advanced for 32 weeks, never finishing a single week below its 10-week moving average. On the week ended April 22, 2011, the stock exploded for a 7% gain. The weekly spread from low to high was 21% **(1)**. That was the highest of any week during the advance on the highest volume of the advance.


Sina also gained eight out of 10 days, another definition of a climax top.


A trader's profit could have tripled if the stock was bought and sold correctly.


Say you didn't. Three weeks later, the stock fell 15% for its first weekly close below its 10-week line  **(2)**. Weekly volume accelerated, so that's another sell signal.


Then, in a single week in June, Sina plunged 20% **(3).** More of your profit is evaporating.


A week later, the stock traded as much as 46% off its high.

Growth investors, learning from experience, tend to lose patience with a stock that breaks out and stalls. Their best trades tend to move higher right away, and the early poor performers tend to be the weeds in the garden. Before digging out the weeds, though, it's worthwhile to ask if the problem is a weak stock or a weak market.

  

In either case you're not making money, so what's the difference? A weak stock deserves a pass; find a better one that is delivering. But if it's a strong stock in a weak market, you might be looking at the beginnings of a great setup.

  

In fact, a strong stock in a weak market is the recipe for a base-on-base formation.

  

"What happens is that a powerful stock breaks out of its base and advances, but is unable to increase a normal 20% to 30% because the general market begins another leg down," William O'Neil wrote in How to Make Money in Stocks. "When the bearish phase in the overall market ends, as it always does at some point, this stock is apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain."

  

Check the stock's relative strength line. Is it trending higher or lower? Higher, and it's outperforming the market. If lower, it's underperforming. Is the market making lower lows, yet the stock is able to climb and hold higher? Countertrend strength is a trait many emerging leaders show.

  

To interpret a base-on-base, first make sure you have a solid understanding of the [primary base patterns](http://education.investors.com/ibd-university/452143-451682-charting-the-course-base-patterns-part-i.aspx) — the cup-with-handle, double-bottom and flat base. The base-on-base is just a combination of two such patterns of bullish price action.

  

The second base in the pattern should find support on top of the first base, or at least in the base's upper half. Base-on-base patterns that fall all the way back to the lows of the first base are weaker.

  

As with any base, you want to see areas of tight trading, institutional accumulation and selling dry-ups in key spots. For base counting purposes, the whole pattern counts as one stage.

  

However, if the stock undercuts the low of the first base, it is no longer a base-on-base. Instead, count it as a whole new pattern and reset the base count.

  

The overall pattern is an expression of leading stocks, which often find support on top of prior basing areas and break out to new highs soon after the market bottoms.

  

**Southwestern Energy** ([SWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWN)) made a huge advance in the mid-2000s. The stock broke out from a flat base in June 2004 and more than doubled before correcting with the market in December.

  

In January 2005, the S&P 500 made a low at 1163.75. Three months later it rolled over and hit a lower low. By contrast, Southwestern climbed and held 32% above its January low. It was the making of a powerful base-on-base setup.

  

The market finally issued a follow-through on April 29, confirming a new uptrend. Southwestern was ready. One session later it gapped past a 63.18 (the chart shows the breakout price adjusted for a pair of 2-for-1 splits) buy point. Its RS line moved into new high territory.

  

The innovative shale gas driller then advanced 164% in just five months before flashing a climax-top sell signal.

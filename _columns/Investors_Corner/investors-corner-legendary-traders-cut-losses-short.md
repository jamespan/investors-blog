*Fourth In A Series*

  

Always cut your losses at 7% or 8%. That's IBD's No. 1 investing rule.

  

But you don't have to take just IBD's word for it.

  

Others in the investing world have promulgated similar rules: Wall Street legend Gerald M. Loeb, for example. Loeb (1899-1974), a founding partner of E.F. Hutton, penned the best-seller "The Battle for Investment Survival."

  

"I'm inclined to say that when a new investment has shrunk by 10%, it is time to stop, look and listen," he wrote in his book.

  

"I think it usually ought to be sold out and the loss taken. If you make an investment of \$10,000 and the market value shrinks to \$9,000 I'm almost inclined to say, dogmatically, sell it out and try again."

  

Loeb goes on to point out that you can always buy back the stock.

  

He adds that there's a bit of a silver lining when you think about getting back into that stock: Your thinking about it now will be much more unbiased, maybe even completely cold.

  

Did Loeb always follow his own rule with stocks?

  

"I would hope," he once said in reply to that question, "to be out long before they ever reach 10%."

  

In other words, he was saying that there's no rule that you have to wait until your loss hits his 10% threshold. If a stock's clearly not working out, just move on.

  

(Side note: That question was posed to Loeb by William J. O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman. O'Neil recounts the exchange in his book "How to Make Money in Stocks.")

  

So IBD's No. 1 rule is quite similar to Loeb's approach.

  

It's just a tad more defensive, recommending that you always bail out whenever a stock falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price.

  

If you make the right buys, you won't have to take 7% or 8% losses that frequently. IBD's research has found most leading stocks rarely drop 7% or 8% from a proper buy point. So it's crucial to use stock charts to make your buying decisions, jumping in as soon as a leader clears a sound consolidation.

  

**An Early Exit Strategy**

  

Like Loeb, IBD also has maintained that you don't need to wait before heading to the exits.

  

In a tough market, you might want to cut your losses at 3%. Think of it as a 3-to-1 approach.

  

You might be happy to take gains at 10% or 15% in a bearish environment. In that case, cut your losses at 3%.

  

On the other hand, in a bullish climate, you could be achieving gains of 20% to 25%. So it's reasonable to bail out when your loss hits 7% or 8%. By sticking to this 3-1 ratio, you can come out ahead even in cases where most of your stocks triggered the 7% or 8% sell rule.

  

Let's say you made four investments. You scored a gain of 25% with one of them, but had to sell the other three for an 8% loss.

  

You still would come out just barely in the black (assuming the trading fees are negligible), because you managed to limit your losses.

  

Another Wall Street legend, Bernard Baruch, has a famous saying related to this point.

  

He said: "Even being right three or four times out of 10 should yield a person a fortune, if he has the sense to cut his losses quickly on the ventures where he is wrong."

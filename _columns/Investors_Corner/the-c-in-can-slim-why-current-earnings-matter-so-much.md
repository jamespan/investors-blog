  The C In CAN SLIM: Why Current Earnings Matter So Much

In your search for great stock winners, one of the first things you should look at is a company's current quarterly earnings growth. Let's cut to the chase: Ideally, quarterly earnings per share should be rising a minimum 25% vs. the year-ago quarter.


This is the 'C' in IBD's [CAN SLIM investment methodology](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).


Top-notch profit growth is one of the most important traits in stock market winners. These companies often build a substantial record of superior quarterly rises in earnings per share *before taking off in price* and hitting new high after new high. Why?


Institutions see earnings as a barometer of a company's corporate health. Strong earnings increases, especially those in the most recent three-month period, mean that a company is not only healthy but also likely generating so much profit that it can use the excess cash to invest for future growth.


IBD research of the biggest winners going back to the 1880s also shows this: companies with huge earnings gains are usually the ones that make a true impact in people's lives and the workplace.


Sales are just as important. As you search for the best investments, be sure to check if the top line of a company's income statement (often stated as revenue) is growing at a fast pace, ideally 25% or more. For very large companies, double-digit gains may do the job.


As noted in "How To Make Money In Stocks" by William O'Neil, IBD chairman and founder, Dell's earnings jumped 74% and 108% in the two quarters before its run-up from November 1996. America Online (before its merger with Time Warner) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) each put up triple-digit gains in their quarterly profits before starting their major moves.


Dell, AOL and Cisco helped transformed the way we get information, communicate and do business, to say the least. All three grew into giant enterprises. All three produced enormous returns for stockholders.


Theoretically, robust profit growth is a key fundamental driver of a company's stock price. The stock of a company that is performing better in its operations should command a higher price. Over the long term, there's no reason for the stock to move up if the company is not delivering higher or strong earnings per share for its shareholders.



More recently, **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)), a Chinese online provider of automobile information and ads for consumers in the number two world economy, grew quarterly earnings 29% to 109% in the two quarters before it shot out of a seven-week consolidation in the week ended Oct. 4, 2013. The stock ran up more than five-fold before peaking at 98.28 in the week ended Aug. 29, 2014.


The stock peaked and corrected sharply. Earnings hit a wall. But today, BitAuto is a high-growth machine once again and shares are picking up steam as the Chinese economy continues to expand and transform. In the past three quarters, earnings per share rose 18%, 78% and 9%. So, the average EPS growth over the past three quarters: a healthy 35%, meeting the 25% minimum gain as defined by CAN SLIM rules.


Sometimes you'll notice that the rate of year-over-year growth may rise from quarter to quarter. Such acceleration is a bullish factor that indicates the company may be hitting full stride.


Growth at some top companies will be in the triple digits, telling you that business is really booming.


"During bull markets (major market uptrends), I prefer to concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or more," IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in the fourth edition of "How To Make Money in Stocks." "You have thousands of stocks to choose from. Why not buy the very best merchandise available?"


Investors can find stocks with fast quarterly earnings growth in [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/), IBD 50 and IBD Big Cap 20. Find all four of these powerful stock screens in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.


The EPS Rating gives you a quick gauge of a company's profit growth, but remember that this is a relative rating. For instance, a stock with a 79 EPS Rating simply means its long- and short-term earnings growth is better than 79% of all companies in the IBD database.


So, please look deeper. Go to the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) and see what was the exact percentage increase for the latest quarter. The Checkup tool will also show the average EPS gain over the past three quarters.


When looking at earnings of top companies, it's not the absolute figure that is important. So don't pass up Company ABC if its latest quarterly earnings was 50 cents a share vs. \$1 a share for Company XYZ. It's the percentage increase from the same period a year ago that's key.


The earnings figures that companies report should be from their core operations. The numbers shouldn't include the sale of assets or other extraordinary gains. If a software company sells a piece of land, that gain should not be included in its operating earnings.

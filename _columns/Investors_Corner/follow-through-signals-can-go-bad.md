In the stock market, nothing works 100% of the time. There is no holy grail. That's why you have to prepare to deal with failed signals.

  

That can happen with a follow-through, a market rally confirmation that was explained in detail in the [June 30 Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/706829-investors-prepared-for-follow-throughs-reap-biggest-gains.htm).

  

A follow-through, which basically involves a gain in higher volume in the Nasdaq or S&P 500, can tell investors when the market has turned the corner from a correction. In the event of a follow-through, investors should start buying leading stocks that are breaking out from sound bases.

  

While follow-throughs have marked every market bottom, some follow-throughs don't result in lasting market uptrends.

  

One thing investors can do to reduce risk is avoid buying with reckless abandon when a follow-through occurs. Use the [pyramid method](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/694194-pyramiding-involves-making-a-series-of-buys.htm?ntt=pyramid) to enter your trades. That way, you test the water and put more money to work only if the trades go in your favor.

  

Pyramiding involves buying in installments instead of all at once. You buy a first piece with half of your allocated capital. If the stock moves up 2% or 3% from your initial purchase price, make a second buy with 30% of your allotted funds. If the stock goes up 5% from the entry, use your remaining allocated capital to make a final buy.

  

Follow-through signals are more likely to fail if distribution days occur in the first few days of a new uptrend. A distribution day, which points to institutional selling, involves a drop of 0.2% or more in the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 in higher volume.

  

Generally, a distribution day within a few days of a follow-through leads to a failed rally. The risk drops off sharply after the fifth day.

  

Another thing to pay attention to: In the early stages of a new uptrend, strong action among leading stocks is crucial. Top-rated stocks should be breaking out of bases in big volume. This is a clear sign that professional investors are stepping back in to buy stocks.

  

The years 2007 and 2008 were downright tough for follow-throughs. Many of them failed as the market faced the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

  

It was a time when the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were cut more than in half from their 2007 highs. On Oct. 16, 2008, the Nasdaq had a big upside reversal and closed up 5.5% in vastly higher trade, marking a follow-through **(1)**. But distribution hit the next day **(2)**, and the correction continued.

  

There would be several more failed follow-throughs before the one on March 12 finally worked.

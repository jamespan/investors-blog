All stocks are speculative, if only because no one knows the future.

Sometimes people will snobbishly suggest that their stocks are "investments" that would never behave like one of those "speculative stocks." (They tend to think in a similar fashion about their children vs. other people's children.)

William O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks" has nothing to say about your children, but on page 244 of the fourth edition, it blares these words in bold type:

"All Common Stocks Are Speculative and Risky."

Translation: Investing is a dangerous game.

How can the individual investor make the game less risky? There are two rules that can help.

First, don't invest in stocks that funds have no position in. If the pros don't want the stock, why should you?

Second, don't invest in a company that has never turned an annual profit. Yes, there are great turnarounds. And sometimes there are big price gains in companies offering only promises. However, those are rare.

You want every advantage you can find when investing. A company making money and attracting serious fund money gives you two edges.

Turnaround stocks are playable but require adjustments.

On page 164 of O'Neil's book, this advice is offered: "Should you decide to buy a turnaround stock, look for annual earnings growth of at least 5% to 10% and two straight quarters of sharp earnings recovery that lift results for the latest 12 months into or very near new high ground. Check the 12-month earnings line on a stock chart; the sharper the angle of the earnings upswing, the better."

IPOs are another area where individual investors are tempted to buy shares in a company that's losing money.

How well does that work out?

IBD ran a computer search on initial public offerings launched since mid-June. Of the 127 IPOs found, roughly half were companies making money and half were companies yet to turn an annual profit.

Results for almost a quarter of the companies were tossed because the action was either sideways or too volatile to characterize.

Among the balance, a clear trend emerged.

The stock price of 68% of the profitable companies rose, but the stock price of 57% of the unprofitable companies fell.

Among the unprofitable companies, many were thinly traded stocks.

Of the profitable companies, more than a few carried institutional-quality liquidity (see the box above.)

Often an IPO is too young for investors to determine if there are funds buying and/or holding shares. But a stock chart will give the investor some clues â€” up days or up weeks in big volume.

Let's say your family decides to go on a road trip to Yosemite National Park. You've never traveled to California. Would you jump in the car without a map, paper or digital?

  

Of course not! Maps give us essential information on the quickest, easiest way to get from Point A to B.

  

In the stock market, charts serve as important maps to wealth.

  

They also help steer investors away from the paths that lead to portfolio destruction.

  

Charts get a bad wrap from some investors and pundits. They dismiss technical analysis as an illegitimate method of studying stock prices.

  

IBD does not advocate making decisions purely on stock-price action alone. Fundamentals are crucial. So is evidence of rising institutional sponsorship. Ultimately, though, a chart tells you whether demand for a stock is strong. If it's not, the opportunity for profit is low.

  

Still not convinced about the power of charts? Consider the following two scenarios. One: You could read several opinions about the market or an individual stock. Two are pounding the table, saying Stock A is a buy. Two others give a bearish view.

  

Two: A chart sums up, on one page, the opinions of millions of investors who are buying and selling the stock. They are expressing their view with their money on the line. Which scenario gives you accurate information?

  

Number two. A chart is especially valuable in this way. You are getting an up-to-date snapshot of how the entire crowd thinks about a stock. Big gains in heavy volume point to strong demand, driving up prices. Big drops in above-average turnover give the opposite message.

  

While IBD features a treasure trove of charts every day — from those in Monday's IBD 50 to Friday's Your Weekly Review to those that make the daily Stock Spotlight feature — let's focus on how to understand and use the charts found on Investors.com.

  

Both the daily and weekly charts on the website feature blue bars (when the stock goes up in price) and red bars (down in price). The hash mark in each bar shows where the stock closed during the day or week. This color scheme helps you quickly get a feel of the stock's direction.

  

In general, a stock showing many more blue bars than red ones is flexing its strength. The price spread found in each bar tells you about the intensity of demand.

  

The volume bars are also painted blue and red, making it easy for you to spot unusually heavy trading on up and down days. Breakouts need big volume to be successful. A stock rising to new highs in low turnover could be signaling poor demand.

  

Here are some other chart-related tips to help you study stocks:

  

• **Stocks On The Move** table on Investors.com. A daily chart of the first stock featured shows up at the top of the table. Pressing the space bar allows you to quickly scroll through the other stocks in the table.

  

• **Investor's Corner**, in the Education tab on the home page. Some columns feature an extra chart that is not published in IBD's print or electronic edition.

  

• **The Daily Stock Analysis** and the **Market Wrap** videos on IBD TV. Wednesday's daily IBD Market Wrap video highlighted the recent action of **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)). Also, check out the 2-Minute Tip video.

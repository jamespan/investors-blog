Ben Bernanke is hawkish. Ben Bernanke is dovish. A bad day in the market makes you think your stock is in danger. A big rally scares you into thinking you're missing the boat on some names you've been tracking.

It's easy to get distracted by the noise — there's so much of it. Learning to recognize clues offered by moving averages will help you get the big picture.

What is a moving average? It is a running mean average of a stock's closing price over some fixed amount of time.

You can get a stock's 50-day moving average by adding its closing price over the past 50 days and dividing that sum by 50.

Looking for a 10-week moving average? Take the Friday closing for each of the past 10 weeks and divide by 10.

Looking for a 200-day moving average? You know what to do.

Every day or week you add, the oldest price close of the bunch falls off as the latest is added. In that way, the average moves.

So who gives a bird's beak about the moving average? You should. That running total takes out many of the short-term blips and bleeps that can confuse you.

Look at the slope of the moving average line, and you're getting a better picture of the overall trend. The Federal Reserve chief can move the market any day he wants, but the 10-week moving average is far more stubborn.

The longer a moving average, the longer the trend you're looking at. But when you get to long-term moving averages — say, the 40-week line or more — you might be smoothing out too much to do you any good.

Consider some crucial investing clues that relate to moving averages.

The rebound off the 10-week moving average typically requires first a low-volume descent, then a high-volume bounce. When this happens the first or second time after a good breakout, you can add shares to a current position.

Beware of stocks that spend too much time — more than eight or nine weeks — below the 10-week moving average. Avoid bases that show buy signals below the 10-week line.

Be aware that the 50-day line and the 10-week line are similar but never exactly the same.

If you're using one as an entry point or as a level to get out, look at the other as well. You may want to give the stock the benefit of the doubt by using the higher of the two as a buy signal, and the lower of the two as a confirmation to sell to preserve gains.

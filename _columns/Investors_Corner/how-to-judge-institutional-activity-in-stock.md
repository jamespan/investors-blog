Odd things sometimes happen, but odd things can't change the odds.

In the 1946 World Series, Boston's future Hall of Famer Ted Williams batted a miserable .200, while Cardinals' journeyman Joe Garagiola batted a dazzling .316.

Yet, based on that, no one would've bet that Garagiola would outperform Williams the following season. And he didn't: Garagiola hit .257 vs. Williams' .343.

Quality doesn't lag for long.

Investing is no different. You want to buy the breakouts of Ted Williams-quality stocks because they are likeliest to work.

Certainly, some thinly traded stocks with middle-of-the-pack ratings can break out of bases and advance smartly. But you don't want to play those odds.

There are many factors that tilt the odds for a stock, but today we'll look at just one â€” the Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

The Accumulation/Distribution Rating appears on the IBD minichart and in the stock tables. The rating reflects a stock's institutional footprint.

Accumulation points to institutional buying. Distribution suggests institutional selling.

The formula that defines the rating is proprietary. It involves a moving average of price-and-volume data. After about 60 days, a day's action becomes irrelevant.

The A or B ratings mean the stock has been under accumulation. The C rating is neutral. The D or E ratings mean the stock has been under distribution.

No gauge is perfect, and two words in the above paragraph point to the imperfection. The words are "has been." There is no way of knowing if a stock will continue to be under accumulation after the breakout.

Still, the rating is a valuable clue, even if it doesn't guarantee a breakout's success.

Let's look at some breakouts and what the rating was before the stock broke out.

We'll look at stocks that broke out on or after the July 11 follow-through day.

The Accumulation/Distribution ratings are from the close the day before the breakout. (Sometimes a breakout will lift the rating sharply, but an investor has no way of knowing in advance.)

The figures are from IBD's database.

The chart above shows 11 stocks and their ratings on the eve of the breakout.

Almost every stock showed accumulation, or at least neutrality, before the breakout.

The exception was **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)). The D- rating on July 10 pointed to institutional selling, but the stock gapped up 8% in double volume July 11. The stock advanced only 11% from that day's close before consolidating.

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) had an A- rating before its July 12 breakout. On July 25, the stock fell 3.5% below a 248.95 buy point, then found traction. The stock gained 34% in less than three months.

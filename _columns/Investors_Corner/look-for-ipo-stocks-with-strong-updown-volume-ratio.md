Buying stocks that have recently launched initial public offerings can bring big rewards, but they're also risky.

Investors should resist the temptation to buy shares right after a stock goes public because they can be volatile in the first days or weeks of trading. It hasn't yet developed a trading range in which a potential base may emerge. Investors who rushed into **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) after its May 2012 IPO watched the stock lose about half its value over the next four months.

Instead, it's best to wait for the stock to settle down and form [an IPO base,](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) which usually takes two to five weeks to form. They may look like conventional bases such as the cup with handle or flat base, and may share characteristics that indicate strong underlying demand. Yet IPO bases are different because they're just shorter.

Roll the clock back nearly 12 years to when internet search giant **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) cleared a 113.58 buy point of an IPO base in late 2004. The base took just 15 trading days to form. The mild decline of 13% from the base's high of 113.48 to low of 98.94 showed that big fund managers weren't so eager to exit the stock.

Some IPO bases are even shorter. Fitness tracking device maker **Fitbit's** ([FIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIT)) IPO base formed over five days in 2015 before the July 1 breakout.

Investors should look for stocks that are rising in heavy trade and clearing their buy points in volume at least 40% to 50% above the 50-day average. But few new issues have established a long enough track record to even make that judgment since the 50-day moving average needs, of course, 50 trading sessions to plot on a chart.

Instead, use the stock's up/down volume ratio, which compares the total amount of volume during up days in price vs. down days within the past 50 trading sessions. This time frame is significantly shorter than the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which covers 65 days, or about 13 weeks. Look for stocks that have an up/down volume ratio of 1.5 or better when they clear an IPO base. Readings above 1.0 indicate that volume on the upside is higher than on the downside. A reading of 1.5 is considered strong.

When Alphabet, known back then as Google, broke out of its IPO base on Sept. 15, 2004, its up/down volume ratio was a whopping 4.7, indicating that volume on the upside towered the downside. In the week prior to its breakout, the ratio was 3.6, also unusually strong. Alphabet soared 318% from its breakout past a 113.58 buy point to a high of 475.11 in the week ended Jan. 13, 2006.

You can find the up/down volume ratio in the Stock Checkup feature at investors.com and on [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) charts.

The correction in IPO bases can be shallow -- less than 20%. Or, if the market is volatile, the correction can be much deeper. The buy point in an IPO base is 10 cents above the high on the left side of the pattern. Investors can learn more about top-rated new issues in the [IPO Analysis column](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm), which appears Tuesdays and Thursdays.

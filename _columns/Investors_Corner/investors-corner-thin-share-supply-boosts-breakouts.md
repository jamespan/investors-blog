  Investor's Corner: Thin Share Supply Boosts Breakouts

A company can have great products or services and its stock may be set up in a picture-perfect cup-with-handle base. But this means absolutely nothing if no buyers step up to the plate.

  

That's where the "S" in CAN SLIM comes in. Nope, the "S" doesn't stand for super; it stands for the fundamental economic principle of supply and demand.

  

The law of supply and demand governs the prices of just about everything in life, whether it be tomatoes or stocks. If there's short supply and big demand, you can count on high prices. But if there's an abundance of supply and little demand, prices will be low.

  

In the stock market, truly heavy demand drives up prices. A few buy orders for 100 shares from Uncle Joe or Aunt Sally will not have much impact. It takes big money to move prices, and only institutions such as mutual funds and hedge funds have the firepower.

  

Volume equals conviction. So if you see a stock move up in double or triple its average daily turnover, it's the professionals who are buying. On the flip side, if a stock sells off in heavy trading, it's the big guns unloading shares.

  

It's crucial to see volume come in at key technical events, such as breakouts or rebounds off the 10-week moving average.

  

When a stock breaks out of a base en route to new highs, you want evidence that professionals are with you. Therefore, volume should be at minimum 40% above its daily average on a breakout.

  

Breakouts in weak volume are more prone to fail.

  

Some stocks will clear a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base in volume that's double or triple its average. That kind of power leaves no doubt that professionals are piling into the stock.

  

The Stocks On The Move table, today on Page B1, shows the big volume jumps. To see how much volume any stock has traded vs. its 50-day average, the data are shown in the IBD Research Tables.

  

**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) blew past an 85.38 buy point from a base-on-base pattern on March 28. Turnover surged to just over 6 million shares, or nearly three times the daily average **1**.

  

The stock's volume left no doubt that professionals bought in large quantities. Lululemon has gained about 20% since its breakout.

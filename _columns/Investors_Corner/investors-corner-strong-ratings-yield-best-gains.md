Most IBD readers know to sell a stock that drops 7% to 8% below the buy point.

  

But how often does a stock fail if your purchases are sound?

  

A sound buy involves many fundamental and chart criteria. Without oversimplifying things too much, you can probably boil the criteria down to a handful of rules.

  

The stock should be fundamentally strong. The industry group should be strong. The stock should have a 30% prior uptrend. The stock should form a proper base or a valid secondary entry. The stock should break out in volume at least 40% greater than average. The stock shouldn't be thinly traded. And the general market should be in a confirmed uptrend.

  

Is this too much to ask? Not if you are willing to sit out a weak market.

  

Rookie investors sometimes toss the rules they don't like and then complain that the rules don't work. Yes, if you don't follow all the rules, the rules you do follow probably won't work. Moses didn't come down the mountain with three commandments and seven you can forget about.

  

The degree of success in the market is directly related to adherence to sound buy rules. Let's look at a case study.

  

From August 2007 through October 2007, the market was in a confirmed rally. IBD identified 39 breakouts. Each offered a valid buy point or buy range and had big volume on the breakout. The Composite Rating was 88 or better in each case. Here's how the 39 did:

  

• **The top-performing tier:** Ten stocks did about four to 10 times better than the Nasdaq's 11.5% gain during the rally. All had a Composite Rating of at least 96. Eight dwelled within the top 30 of 197 industry groups. The other two were in groups rated 41st and 53rd — still the top third of all groups. None were thin. Average gain: 75%.

  

• **The second tier:** Nine stocks did roughly two to three times better than the Nasdaq's gain. Seven had a Composite Rating of 97 or better. Seven were in industry groups rated No. 30 or better. Two came from groups rated No. 39 and No. 61 — still the top third. Two were thin. Average gain: 32%.

  

• **The third tier:** Eight stocks did at least one and a half times better than the Nasdaq but not twice as well. Three had a Composite Rating of at least 96. Two were in industry groups rated 73rd and 89th — failing to make the top third. One was thin. Average gain: 19%.

  

• **The fourth tier:** Six stocks either narrowly outperformed or narrowly underperformed the Nasdaq. Two stocks were in industry groups rated 126th and 173rd — clear laggards. A third stock was somewhat thin. Average gain: 11%.

  

• **The fifth tier:** Six stocks fell 7% or more from the ideal buy point. Two were thinly traded. Two others came from industry groups rated 67 and 92 — not the top third.

  

As you go down the list, you can see the link between following the rules and performance.

  

Overall, 15% of the 39 breakouts triggered the 7% to 8% sell rule and 25% underperformed the Nasdaq. Here are some success breakdowns, with success defined as outperforming the Nasdaq:

  

Success rate for breakouts in the top third of industry groups and that aren't thinly traded: 87%. Average gain of the winners, 44%.

  

Success rate of thin stocks: 60%. Average gain of winners, 24%.

  

Success rate of stocks in the bottom two-thirds of industry groups: 50%. Average gain of winners: 17%.

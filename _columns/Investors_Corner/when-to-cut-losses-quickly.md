A stock sometimes offers great promise as it breaks out of a base, but doesn't act right soon afterward. The stock might be signaling it's not a good choice after all. If the stock soon produces losses, you don't have to wait for the 8% [stop-loss sell rule](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/675354-stock-sell-rules-preserve-investor-capital.htm) to trigger in order to exit the position. You can sell well before that.

  

In fact, IBD's [stock market research](http://education.investors.com/) shows that if a stock breaks out of a base and immediately drops more than 3.5% to 4% below the proper buy point, chances are high the stock is failing or it needs more time to build a new base.

  

If you think about it, that makes sense. If you buy just before a stock moves above the 5% buy zone, and then it drops 8%, that's almost a 3.5% drop below where you purchased shares.

  

Also, IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil has said he is typically out of a stock well before his loss hits 8%.

  

About 40% of successful breakouts pull back near the buy point. So a gentle pullback in declining volume soon after a breakout is little cause for alarm, especially if the investor bought as close as possible to the buy point.

  

What negative signs should you watch for? Watch for a large gap down on significant news, a harsh sell-off in heavy volume, or a market shift that sends the indexes lower due to heavy distribution. A breakout that shows the character of the stock has changed from prior breakouts is another sign that something is wrong.

  

**Nuance Communications** ([NUAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUAN)) broke out of a cup base with a 27.07 buy point in January 2012. The company was reported to have created the software that powered Siri, Apple's new voice command and personal assistant application for the iPhone.

  

The stock gained on its first five days out of the base in impressive volume. But on five of the next seven days, the stock closed near the low of each day in above-average volume **(1)**, a red flag.

  

On Feb. 9, hours before quarterly earnings were released, the stock rocketed to a new high in heavy volume. Some investors were betting on blowout results.

  

But Nuance missed on earnings and revenue, and the stock gapped down the next day in even heavier trade **(2)**. It fell below the buy point, closing the day 13% lower at 26.50, 2% below the 27.07 buy point. Here was the time not to wait for an 8% loss. Sell there. Nuance rallied back and recovered its 50-day moving average. But it fell again and never saw that buy point again.

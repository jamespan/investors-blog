What's even better than a company's earnings report showing a strong year-over-year gain? Steady profit growth. "Any company can report a good earnings quarter every once in a while," IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "To make sure the latest results aren't just a flash in the pan, and the company you're looking at is of high quality, you must insist on more proof."

Especially given the market's recent volatility, a stable earnings track record can be one way to calm investors' nerves.

Such companies' stocks tend to be more steady performers, even if they might not be the fastest growers.

How can an investor find out if a company's strong earnings report is a normal event or an anomaly? Check its Earnings Per Share Stability Factor, which can be found in the detailed stock charts on [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com/) , a sister company to IBD.

The EPS Stability Factor is calculated using a company's quarterly per-share earnings over the past three to five years. A line drawn along the profit figures measures how much the earnings deviate from their core trend.

The resulting stability factor runs on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). If a company has a stability factor of 1, the majority of its earnings during the latest three- to five-year period fall within a 1% band around the line.

So the lower the EPS Stability Factor a company has, the steadier its earnings. What is too high a number? A factor below 25 is generally considered stable.

Stable profits plus steady performance â€” sound familiar?

Those are traits often found among more established, bigger-cap companies, such as those in the Big Cap 20, published in IBD every Tuesday. The table above shows Big Cap 20 stocks with the lowest EPS Stability Factor, listed in order of highest Composite Ratings.

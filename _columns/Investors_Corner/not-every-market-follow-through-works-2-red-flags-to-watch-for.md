In the stock market, nothing works 100% of the time. That's why you have to prepare to deal with failed signals.




It can happen even with IBD's market-timing concept, the [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), a component of [The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends/). Chances of grabbing profits in growth stocks increase when the market is acting right, which is why we actively monitor adjust the [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/).


IBD research has found that every major stock market bottom going back to at least [the year 1900](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-follow-through-day-sparked-a-market-bottom-one-century-ago/) featured a follow-through. It essentially confirms that a fledgling uptrend in stocks is underway.


You only need a follow-through from one major index to begin a new quest to find great breakouts by stocks with great fundamentals, relative price strength, and rising fund sponsorship.

After a significant decline in the major indexes such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite (think 10% or more), the follow-through marks a significant gain that typically takes place on the fourth day or later of a new rally attempt. The gain usually must be a minimum 1.2% but it can be as high as 3% to 4% or more.


Without exception, [the follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) must also feature higher total volume vs. the prior session, either on the Nasdaq for a follow-through by the Nasdaq composite or on the NYSE in the case of a big gain by the S&P 500.


Trading in November and December of 2018 has shown that follow-throughs don't always result in lasting market uptrends.


How "Pyramiding" Reduces Portfolio Risk
---------------------------------------



One thing investors can do to reduce risk is avoid buying stocks anew with reckless abandon when a follow-through occurs. Use the pyramid method to enter your trades. That way, you test the water and put more money to work only if the trades go in your favor.


Pyramiding involves buying in installments instead of all at once. You buy a first piece with half of your allocated capital toward a single stock. If the stock moves up 2% or 3% from your initial purchase price, make a second buy with 30% of your allotted funds. If the stock goes up 4% to 5% from the [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), use your remaining allocated capital to make a final buy.


One Red Flag That A Follow-Through May Fail
-------------------------------------------


Follow-through signals are more likely to fail if [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) occur in the first few days of a new uptrend. This is one key red flag. A distribution day, which points to institutional selling, involves a drop of 0.2% or more in the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 in higher volume.


Generally, a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) within a few days of a follow-through leads to a failed rally. The risk drops off sharply after the fifth day.


A second red flag? In the early stages of a new uptrend, strong action among leading stocks is crucial. Top-rated stocks should be [breaking out of bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) in big volume. Strong breakouts signal that professional investors are stepping back in to buy stocks.


The years 2007 and 2008 were downright tough for follow-throughs. Many failed as the market faced the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 saw declines of more than 50% from their 2007 highs.


A Failed Stock Market Follow-Through In 2008
--------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ICnsdq022218-300x169.png)On Oct. 16, 2008, the Nasdaq staged a big upside reversal and closed up 5.5% in vastly higher trade. It marked a Day 5 follow-through **(1)**. But the rally stalled the next day; a few sessions later on Oct. 22, the Nasdaq dropped 4.8% in heavier trade, a clear distribution day **(2)**.


The next session, the index undercut the low of Day 1 in the rally attempt. The rally was dead.


Another follow-through took place Dec. 2 **(3)**, Day 7 of a brand-new rally attempt. The Nasdaq gained 3.7%. Volume rose, meeting the technical requirements. But after rising another 15% over the next four weeks, the uptrend stalled.


By January 2009, the Nasdaq took out the low of the second rally attempt. Back to "market in correction. "


The 3rd Follow Through Was A Charm
----------------------------------


A new Day 5 follow-through on March 12, 2009 arrived. The S&P 500 bolted 4.1% higher in 3% heavier volume vs. the prior day. The Nasdaq shot 4% higher and volume jumped, but was still in Day 3 of its own new rally attempt **(4)**.

Firearms maker **Smith & Wesson** ([SWHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWHC)) is a big shot in 2015, up more than 100%. When the stock started its move in April, it was on the verge of a turnaround, thanks to new conditions in its industry.

Smith probably wasn't on the radar of IBD-style growth investors when it soared out of a cup-with-handle base in mid-April.

The catalyst: The firm noted that business was starting to turn after several soft quarters.

Smith raised its fiscal Q4 revenue target by 8% to between \$175 million and \$179 million.

The result: \$181 million, up just 6% from a year ago, but it snapped a four-quarter streak of year-over-year declines.

When Smith started building the base, its RS Rating of 92 was solid. So was its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A-. But its Composite Rating and Earnings Per Share Rating left a lot to be desired. No surprise, since earnings weigh heavily in each rating and Smith & Wesson came up well short in this regard due to sluggish results in recent quarters.

The base had positive and negative attributes. It was symmetrical. The right side of the base had two bullish accumulation weeks (weekly price gains in heavy trading) and the handle area was picture-perfect **(1)**. It drifted lower in orderly trade and in light volume. But a 48% correction on the left side made it flawed. The correction in this pattern generally should not exceed 30% to 35%.

It's human nature to bend the rules sometimes. Sometimes it will pay off in spades. Other times not. In Smith's case, growth investors who bought primarily on technicals were rewarded.

In light of big-news shootings, more strenuous gun control is back on the front burner, and it's a reason Smith continues to show relative strength. Investor expectations are that gun enthusiasts will buy more firearms.

Smith's ratings looked a lot better when it cleared another base in August. The initial breakout came in light volume; Smith weakened after that. But shares gapped up over a 17.14 buy point on Aug. 28, fueled by a strong fiscal Q1 earnings report. Revenue growth accelerated from the prior quarter, rising 12% to \$147.8 million. Earnings per share increased 23%, helping lift its EPS Rating to 83 from 55.

It surged past a 19.07 buy point on Dec. 7, one day before a solid fiscal Q2 report, then rose 16% in the next five sessions. Profit jumped 178% to 25 cents a share on a 32% rise in sales.

Keeping tabs on the market's overall trend helps the savvy investor preserve and build wealth. Ignoring it can cause those profits to evaporate quickly.

  

Leading growth stocks tend to outperform the market on the upside, sometimes significantly. But those same stocks can fall 1.5 to 2.5 times faster than their bigger, slower-moving peers when the market corrects.

  

"With greater opportunity comes significant additional risk," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

The point? Don't make the mistake of ignoring the market.

  

Take **Denbury Resources** ([DNR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DNR)), an oil and gas producer in the Gulf Coast region. The stock more than doubled from January 2007 to February 2008, when it began shaping a cup-with-handle base. The stock cleared the pattern in May and went on to a new record high of 38.60 before pulling back to its 10-week line in the week ended June 6, 2008 **1**.

  

Normally, the first or second pullback to the key support line following a breakout gives investors a fresh buying opportunity. But June 6, 2008 — the day that Denbury found support — was also the day that the market went into a correction.

  

The case of Denbury shows why it's so important to read about the 'M' in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. It stands for market direction. Knowing what to do when the market is in a confirmed uptrend, an uptrend under pressure, or in a correction is crucial to reducing risk in your portfolio and becoming a successful IBD investor.

  

An entire chapter is dedicated to the issue in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

IBD analyzes the market's direction every day and displays the overall trend in the Market Pulse box that accompanies the Big Picture. This [column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) summarizes the day's market action in the context of the general market's trend. It also examines that day's best and worst performers among leading stocks.

  

At the time, Denbury boasted best-possible 99 Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings. The Relative Strength line was holding near high ground, and the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating was B-. Volume was heavy as the stock rebounded off its 10-week line, a good sign.

  

In an uptrending market, the decision to buy a strong stock such as Denbury would have carried low risk. And, for a couple of weeks, Denbury fought off the market's downdraft, hitting a new high of 40.32. But even the strongest stocks can't hold up against a market correction for long.

  

Denbury succumbed soon after, piercing its 10-week line in early July **2**. Volume was light, but it picked up in the weeks ahead as the sell-off gathered steam. By late November, the stock had plunged to a low of 5.59, 86% off its peak. During that time, the S&P 500 corrected nearly 46%.

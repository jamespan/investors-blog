The 1990s' bull market showed why it's key to be on top of breakouts that take place early in a stock's run — even if the stock needs two breakouts to get going.


**International Game Technology** ([IGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGT)) was one such stock. It cleared two buy points early in the decade and began a long climb.


The maker of computerized gaming equipment for casinos broke out past a 29.23 buy point of a [base-on-base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/771399-base-on-base-breakout-yield-big-gains.htm) on Oct. 10, 1991 (the accompanying chart shows prices following 2-for-1 splits in August 1991 and March 1992). It gained 466% in two years, hitting a split-adjusted high of 41.38 in the week that ended Oct. 1, 1993.


IGT was among a plethora of stocks that became big winners in the [1990s](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/774324-cisco-systems-winning-base.htm). Its growth was fueled by heavy investment in new gaming technologies and laws that allowed the construction of casinos on rivers and Indian reservations.


IGT's breakout came amid a sideways-trending market. Volume was 29% above average, a little shy of the 40% spike you'd like to see. But it picked up the next day, rising 67% above normal in a sign that institutional investors were behind the move.


IGT had reported a 125% jump in profit in the quarter prior to its breakout, accelerating from a 17% increase in the prior quarter. The stock's Earnings Per Share Rating was 97 out of a best-possible 99, and its relative strength line was hitting a new high, another bullish indicator.


IGT's strong performance was foreshadowed by strong characteristics in its base. It was an early-stage pattern, so risk was lower than if the pattern had formed later in the stock's advance. The second part of the base-on-base showed tight trading as it corrected 19%, which is attractively shallow. Also, both the stock's daily and weekly charts showed more accumulation than distribution — that is, more weekly gains in above-average volume than declines in above-average trade.


The pattern's left side shows a shakeout in which the stock fell 8.5% in above-average volume during the week ending Sept. 6 **(1)**. Shakeouts are healthy because they force weak holders out of the stock, setting the stage for the stock to move higher.


IGT also closed in the upper 60% of its weekly range and ended just 2 cents below its 10-week moving average during the shakeout, a sign that institutional investors were propping up the stock. From there, trading tightened up considerably leading up to the Oct. 10 breakout.


At the time of its breakout, IGT appeared in IBD's NYSE Stocks In The News Table, which tracks stocks that hit new highs or rose in heavy volume. IGT's Earnings Per Share Rating was 97; its Relative Price Strength Rating was 98, indicating that it was outperforming 98% of all stocks.


Note that IGT's base was preceded by the first half of the base-on-base pattern, which began in May. It cleared a 49.35 buy point (before splits) on July 19, but volume didn't grow sharply above average. Nevertheless, the stock rose 19%, just shy of the 20% gain required to form a new base.


In early September, IGT pulled back below the buy point, triggering a sell signal, during the shakeout week that helped define the upper part of the base-on-base. The lesson? Stocks can rebound even after triggering a sell signal, so investors who have confidence in a stock should watch for a new base to form.

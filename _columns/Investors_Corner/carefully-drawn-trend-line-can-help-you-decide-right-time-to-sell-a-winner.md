Every success-minded stock investor desires to sell all top growth stocks at the top. Alas, every investor is also human.




Yet you don't need to be perfect to bag a large chunk of profits from your best stocks.


For more than 20 years, the Investor's Corner has published hundreds of articles on the [best rules in selling big winning stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/). One of these rules involves properly drawing a trend line and using that trend line to identify a serious decline that is spurred by active institutional selling.


When a good stock breaks through a properly drawn trend line in heavy volume, it's usually time to sell.

The best stocks tend to pull back numerous times throughout their long run, making higher highs and higher lows. Nevertheless, watch each pullback carefully. One of them will be the sell-off that kills the rally.


The trend line starts at the low of the first pullback to or near the 10-week line after a breakout from a proper base such as a cup with handle or flat base. The trend line extends through the lows of two subsequent pullbacks.


When To Sell Growth Stocks: Avoid This Stock Chart Error
--------------------------------------------------------



Draw the line on a weekly chart over a span of at least 18 weeks. A line drawn on a daily chart, or one drawn over a shorter period, may compel you to sell too early.


The trend line method is not designed to trigger a sell right at the top, but it's been repeatedly shown to work for growth stocks. Investors should also consider overall market health, stock fundamentals and other chart signals in deciding whether it's time to sell.


The Big Picture column will help you understand market health. Be aware of the general reaction toward individual stocks following corporate earnings reports, too.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), the pioneering maker of da Vinci robotic surgical systems, broke out above a 19.20 buy point from a cup-with-handle base in July 2004. The company turned years of net losses with a strong profit that year.


![ic_isrg_chrt_101216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IC_ISRG_chrt_101216-1024x577.png)


That breakout unleashed a torrid run; Intuitive climbed 626% over the next year and a half to a peak of 139.50 on Jan. 31, 2006, then spent the next 12 months forming a new base.


The year 2007 was good for stocks. Intuitive broke out again, rising 9% in the week ended March 23 and surpassing a new 118.07 buy point within a long base that resembled a shallow double bottom with handle. Over the next three months, the medical tech firm climbed steadily, finding support at or near its rising 10-week moving average.


Then shares really took off with a nearly 34% jump in the week ended July 27 **(1)**. A trend line could be drawn with the first point being the low of that week at 146. Using a logarithmic chart, the second and third points of the trend line could be connected at the lows during the weeks ended Oct. 19 and Nov. 16. Total time period between the first point and the third point of the trend line: 18 weeks.


In January of 2008, Intuitive changed in character. The stock traded in a volatile manner, then fell four weeks in a row **(2)**. In the second and third weeks of that decline, the stock slid a combined 20% in price. That action violated the properly drawn trend line.


Time to sell.


Intuitive made a giant rebound off its 40-week moving average a month later, and went on to complete a new base. But it was wide and loose, and thus flawed. A breakout past a deep handle at 315.90 lacked the power to send Intuitive hitting a new high. Faulty late-stage bases also flash a valuable sell signal for alert shareholders.


By late November 2008, amid the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and subprime debt meltdown, Intuitive dropped to as low as 110.35, 69% off its 359.59 peak.

  How To Invest: Why Personal Ideas Aren't Worth Much

Myths sometimes refuse to die, even after they've been busted.

  

For instance, with the advent of computers, investing professionals were able for the first time to crunch a ton of data and test long-held views and beliefs. Some ideas didn't survive the examination.

  

IBD's sister company William O'Neil + Co. developed one of the world's first computerized stock databases in the early 1960s. One tool that research found useless to growth investors was the price-to-earnings ratio.

  

"For years, analysts have used P-E ratios as their basic measurement tool in deciding whether a stock is undervalued (has a low P-E) and should be bought, or is overvalued (has a high P-E) and should be sold," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks," the fourth edition. "But our ongoing analysis of the most successful stocks from 1880 to the present shows that, contrary to most investors' beliefs, P-E ratios were not a relevant factor in price movement and have very little to do with whether a stock should be bought or sold. Much more crucial, we found, was the percentage increase in earnings per share."

  

O'Neil & Co. discovered that fact decades ago. But while research can change the conclusion, it can't change human nature.

  

To this day, many investors and investment advisers can't let go of the P-E ratio.

  

Other myths stay alive among small groups of cultlike devotees.

  

Some investors rely on chart patterns such as coils, pennants, triangles, triple bottoms and head-and-shoulder bottoms. Do you ever wonder why IBD doesn't include these patterns in its chart lineup?

  

"Our detailed model building and investigations of price structure over the years have shown these patterns to be unreliable and risky," O'Neil wrote.

  

Other faulty approaches sound safe, but aren't.

  

Diversification is such an approach. Many individual investors believe that holding lots of different kinds of stocks is safer than concentrating funds in a few strong stocks.

  

Legendary money manager Peter Lynch called this "deworsefication."

  

The problem is twofold. First, the diversified portfolio can compromise good returns. Second, and this is probably more damaging, diversification can create a false sense of security. This can lead the investor to hold on while the market is falling apart.

  

A concentrated stock portfolio of, say, five or six stocks, however, is easy to unwind rapidly.

  

If an investor can't handle the idea of a concentrated portfolio, then he or she should consider IBD's ETF index strategy (see Page A10 in today's paper).

  

Here are some additional myths:

  

•**Idea:** Dividends offer protection because as the stock falls the dividend yield will rise, thereby attracting buyers. Reality: This might have some validity in an intermediate correction. But the bears will make lunch meat out of it in a bear market. And a dividend can be cut when a company is under pressure.

  

•**Idea:**Bonds are safe, conservative investments. Reality: Too often the individual investor will stretch for yield, wiping out any conservative value that bonds might have.

  

•**Idea:** Just buy the top stocks in the IBD 50 and you can't lose. Reality: Ignoring the general market and how far a stock is extended can lead to quick and deep losses.

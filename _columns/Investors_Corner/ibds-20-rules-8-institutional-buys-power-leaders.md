[IBD's 20 Rules](https://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/SpecialReport/583489/201109141435/IBDs-20-Rules-for-Your-Investment-Success.aspx): **An Investor's Corner Series**

_Eighth in a series_

Follow the big money, and you'll get a handle on a stock's chances for success. You'd do very well to take note of a stock's increasing institutional sponsorship as a sign to take that stock seriously.

Without big-money investors such as mutual funds and banks, a stock will find great trouble putting up big gains. Those big guns account for the lion's share of daily stock-market volume.

Did you think that it's the small investors that determine a stock's fate? Don't flatter yourself.

Here's another tip: Some very smart people run those funds. And with billions on the line, they invest plenty in research â€” that means even more smart people on the payroll.

They put their boots on the ground to find fast-growing companies. They invest in airfare and lunch to meet the CEOs and other decision makers at companies that show potential, as well as their suppliers, customers and even rivals.

How can you tell what sort of sponsorship a stock enjoys? IBD makes that easy for you.

Check the stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating. This proprietary tool looks at a stock's price and volume history over the past 13 weeks. Prefer those that score an A or B, which signals heavy buying. That's almost always a proxy for institutional involvement. One exception to that rule is found in thin stocks; one big buyer can skew the numbers.

But you can see far more detail if you wish. Call up a weekly chart on MarketSmith, IBD's affiliate service. MarketSmith features a table showing the percentage of shares held by management, banks and large investment funds.

Call up **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)). Fifty-seven percent of its shares are held by mutual funds.

In the box below you'll find the number of funds that own Baidu. This feature gives you a sense of trend. It shows not just the most recent quarter but the most recent four quarters too.

What do you see for Baidu? Twelve hundred different funds owned the stock as of the end of Q2. By itself, that number may not mean anything to you.

But now look at the history: Some 991 funds held shares in last year's Q3. That total dipped to 940 in Q4, then surged to 1,112 in this year's first quarter.

In this light, the recent 1,201 total looks like fund managers have resumed their interest in China's top search engine.

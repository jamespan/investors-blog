IBD offers a wide range of proprietary ratings to help you gauge any stock you're studying.

  

Each aims to give you another layer of understanding as you analyze a stock.

  

These five IBD ratings get most of the attention: Composite, EPS, Sales + Margins + ROE, Relative Strength and Accumulation/Distribution.

  

Today's Investor's Corner puts a spotlight on another valuable way to grade a stock: its Supply/Demand Rating.

  

This rating gauges investor demand in a stock by comparing its volume with its float. Keep in mind that a stock's float is how many shares, from all those outstanding, are available in the open market rather than being restricted.

  

A high rating says turnover is so busy that a high number of shares out in the market are changing hands to keep up with investors.

  

Basically, you get a sense of the intensity of trading in a stock. You can use the rating to get a sense of how powerful a breakout is. It also indicates a stock's volatility.

  

Remember that intense trading happens not just on a breakout, but also in a sell-off. So even when a stock is sinking like a submarine, its Supply/Demand Rating could remain buoyant. Make sure you are paying attention to key sell signals in the chart action.

  

The Supply/Demand Rating runs from a worst-possible 1 to a best-possible 99. A grade of 1 means that 99% of stocks fare better in this category, a 30 means 70% fare better, and a 99 means the stock is in the top 1%.

  

In other words, a rating of 99 means a stock is showing the most demand vs. its float compared with all other stocks in IBD's database. And of course, stocks trading heavy volume with low floats tend to carry higher Supply/Demand Ratings.

  

The rating is listed in several places in IBD's print edition and eIBD.

  

You will find it in the bottom-right corner of the mini charts that run with the daily Stock Spotlight feature, Monday's IBD 50, Tuesday's Big Cap 20 and Friday's Your Weekly Review.

  

You will also find a Top Supply/Demand Companies screen in IBD every Thursday. Look in the Table of Contents on Page A2 to find the right page.

  

The stocks that make this selective screen have more than just high Supply/Demand Ratings. They also have strong fundamentals and meet other proprietary criteria.

  

The accompanying table shows stocks that made the screen after the follow-through on Sept. 1, 2010, the confirmation of a new market rally. The screen managed to highlight some of the big winners in that broad rally, like **Cliffs Natural Resources** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **Riverbed Technology** ([RVBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVBD)).

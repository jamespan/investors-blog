It can be tough to find the time to comb through thousands of publicly-traded companies for potential investment candidates. But the MarketSmith Growth 250 can help you easily find top stocks to watch, like longtime medical sector leader **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) and [IPO stock leader](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-ping-identity-cybersecurity-breaking-out-new-buy-point/) **Ping Identity** ([PING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PING)).




An easy way to quickly identify some of the top growth stocks near [potential buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is to use the MarketSmith Growth 250 Near Pivot sub-list. The premium list overlays the [Pattern Recognition](https://marketsmith.investors.com/patternrecognition/) (real-time chart pattern analysis) over the [Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com/growth250/) (an institutional-quality list of top growth stock ideas) to create one list of top stocks near potential buy points.


Other sub-lists within MarketSmith Growth 250 include "Breaking Out Today," "Recent Breakouts" and "Tight Areas."


On Feb. 19, Near Pivot candidates include Intuitive Surgical and Ping Identity, as the current stock market uptrend continues, according to the [IBD Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). The Nasdaq and S&P 500 notched record highs Wednesday.

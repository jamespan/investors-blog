Winning stocks tend to congregate in the top industries, which makes IBD's [industry group ranking](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) an indispensable tool.

Studies of the most successful stocks in market history show industry leadership is indeed an essential ingredient. Why? Positive trends in industries often produce winning stocks, not necessarily the other way around.

Don't overlook this important element, and make it part of your stock-picking checklist. Historically, winning stocks are in the top 40 industry groups. Focus your research in that section of the performance table.

Of course, when an industry group is leading, it doesn't mean all or even most stocks in it turn out to be great picks. Each industry has only a few true leaders. These strong companies produce [gains of more than 20% from their breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) before they correct again.

## Where To Look

To find a stock's industry ranking, you can check its quote at [IBD's website](https://www.investors.com/). The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) at Investors.com is another good resource, and goes to the meat of the issue because it tells you which stocks are at the top of the group. This is the easiest way to find industry leaders.

Check if the stock is in the top two or three in terms of Composite Rating. It's also good if the company is among the best in EPS Rating and Relative Price Strength Rating.

Some industries may have more than just a few quality leaders. In 2022 for example, enterprise software counted on **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)), **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) and **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) as legitimate leaders. No wonder the group was in the top five. The business software market is gigantic; these companies don't overlap much in the services they provide.

Every once in a while, there's a lone wolf; a leading stock that rallies by itself, no industry peers joining in the move. Don't let that bother you. If the company's fundamentals are superior and the chart shows constructive behavior, consider it a potentially good investment.

To find the industry group list each day, check the [IBD Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/). The industry ranking gets a daily update every late afternoon. In IBD Weekly, the top 40 list is published on What's The Market Trend? page of IBD Weekly. IBD publishes the full rankings on a separate page in the newspaper's B section.

When a stock falls in heavy volume, it's not always a bad sign.

  

In fact, it can be healthy, depending on the stock's action by the week's end and where that sharp decline happens within the stock's base.

  

One element of a great base is a positive reversal, in which a stock falls in heavy volume but bounces back, ending up for the day or week. Or it finishes in the upper 60% of its trading range.

  

A stock that's able to recover most or all of its lost ground after, say, disappointing earnings news or an analyst downgrade is showing bullish action. That's especially true if volume on the reversal is heavy.

  

That volume tells you institutions are helping to prop up the stock as others sell.

  

Sometimes a positive reversal can be a buying opportunity, such as when a stock reverses higher after getting support at its 50-day or 10-week moving average. In such cases, volume should be above average or at least up from the previous week or day.

  

**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)), an auto parts retailer, began shaping a base-on-base pattern in July 2011. Both structures showed tight trading with weekly trading ranges of less than 10%, another sign of institutional support.

  

The left side of the first pattern, a cup base, shows five straight weekly declines, including three in heavy volume. In two of those weeks, the stock ended in the lower half of its weekly range. Such action early in the base-building process is normal.

  

What happens at the bottom of the base is very important. O'Reilly's action was positive, as the stock staged an upside reversal after hitting bottom in the week ended Aug. 5 **(1)**. Volume was heavy as the stock rebounded off its low to end in the upper 60% of its weekly range.

  

The following week was also an upside reversal in heavy volume that marked the start of a six-week run during which the stock cleared a 66.62 buy point.

  

O'Reilly sported Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings of 97 and 89 respectively when it broke out Sept. 6.

  

Furthermore, the Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group had jumped 72 places in six weeks, to No. 11 out of 197.

  

The company was faring well as cost-conscious consumers began keeping their cars longer, pushing up the average of vehicles on the road to record highs. However, volume on O'Reilly's breakout was below average and failed to pick up as the stock rose to a high of 72 on Sept. 19.

  

Investors could have been forgiven for refraining from buying despite the stock's strong fundamentals and the fact that the market was in a confirmed uptrend.

  

In such cases, patience is often rewarded. That was the case with O'Reilly, which pulled back to its 10-week line as it formed the second part of the pattern — a flat base with a buy point at 72.10 **(2)**. The bottom of that base shows another positive reversal, albeit in light volume.

  

The breakout came Oct. 27, with O'Reilly gapping up 8% in volume that was 96% above average. From there, O'Reilly began a steady climb to a peak of 107.13 in the week ended April 27, 2012 — 61% above the 66.62 cup buy point and 49% above the flat base entry.

  

The stock then began a yearlong consolidation before moving on to new highs.

  Know The Benefit Of Studying Past Market Tops

It's nice to have a sharp market guru tell you when the market may peak. So, what's better than that?

  

Perhaps it's having the right knowledge and tools to identify market-topping action by yourself.

  

In the stock market, as in life, self-reliance is a virtue.

  

Thursday's column introduced the concept of distribution days. A flurry of them after a market rally helps you prepare for the downside of the market. By reading [The Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) and studying the Nasdaq and S&P 500 daily charts on IBD's "What's The Market Trend?" (today on Page B2), you're practicing the same ritual as many of the top minds in the business.

  

Want another healthy mental exercise to help you sharpen your market skills? Go back and study and review past major market tops. Why? The monetary environment, the level of investor hysteria, the key news events, the size of the market's ascent, and the leaders that shaped the bull run will always change. What does not change is the manner in which the market goes into a correction.

  

The only way to see this change is by clearly seeing clues given by the market's price and volume action.

  

As experienced IBD readers know, that a "correction" can come in many flavors, like salsa: mild, medium and hot. Mild declines can be 3% to 7%. Medium corrections could range from 8% to 12% or more. A bear market is typically a 20% fall from the most recent peak.

  

On Page 213 of "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder Bill O'Neil names 71 bear market and "intermediate-term distribution tops" since 1955 worth studying. You can use MarketSmith or another chart service to go back and look at historical tops closely.

  

The 2007 market top that punctuated the big 4-1/2-year bull run is worth study and re-study. Leading stocks were getting too hot. **Coach** ([COH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COH)), **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)), **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)) and **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) gave key sell signals, then fell hard.

  

On Oct. 19, 2007, the Nasdaq slid 2.7% in higher trade, **(1)** a day of clear institutional selling. There were more to come. A 1.9% drop Nov. 8 **(2)** boosted the distribution count to six in less than four weeks on the Nasdaq. In the Nov. 9 Big Picture ("Market Sell-Off Ensnares Tech Leaders"), IBD's outlook switched from "Rally under pressure" to "Market in correction."

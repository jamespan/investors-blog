A bearish reversal by **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) on May 13 of 2010 set the stage for a challenging few months of chart reading.

  

The China-based search engine had already posted a phenomenal run, up 165% from its breakout in July 2009.

  

Starting May 12, 2010, when the company enacted a 10-for-1 stock split, Baidu shares spiked 15% in two days. They then reversed and settled into a consolidation.

  

The 19% dip was too deep to be a flat base. But the test of support at the 10-week moving average held.

  

A series of positive moves over the next few weeks lacked serious volume. Then, on June 21, shares jumped 3%. Volume rose 35% — below the 40% you want to see in a breakout, but close enough that it might have been tempting to fudge the rules 1 (weekly chart shown).

  

The stock lolled for a week and tanked 9%, undercutting its 10-week line in heavy trading.

  

Baidu finally put in a bottom on July **1**, then began climbing **2**. Nowhere along that climb did it fashion a viable handle. So where to plot the new buy point?

  

The left-side high of the base put one possible buy point at 82.39 **3**.

  

A more aggressive option: Draw a trend line from the May 13 high, across the June 21 high to a probable intersection with the base's right side.

  

This gave a buy point of 75.35. Baidu rewarded investors who opted to dive at this higher-risk buy point, but not before toying with them like a panda bear.

  

The stock cleared the mark, briefly, in less than optimum trade on July 21 and 22 **4**. On July 23 it ran well past the buy point, but volume slipped 1%.

  

Shares rose 17% in four weeks, then pulled back almost to the initial buy point. The soft trade on the pullback was a good sign.

  

If the prior base was challenging, the base begun in August sent much clearer signals.

  

It corrected 14% — either a flat base or a cup without handle. It found support at the 10-week line. The move off the 10-week came in low volume. As the base built its right side, accumulation outweighed distribution.

  

There was no arguing with this buy point: 88.42.

  

The stock cleared that mark with a 5% jump Sept. 20 on a 40% increase in trade **5**.

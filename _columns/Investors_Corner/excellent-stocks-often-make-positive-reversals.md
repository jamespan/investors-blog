You wouldn't hire someone who had a history of responding to adversity with these 10 words:


"This is too tough. It can't be done. I quit."


Is that the way your stocks act?


When you buy a stock, you're essentially hiring that stock to work for you. One factor that can indicate whether you're looking at a stud or a dud is found within the base.


There are many things you can look for within the base. Today we'll discuss just two — positive reversals and shakeouts.


A positive reversal is when a stock — facing the adversity of a losing week or day — reverses higher in bullish fashion.


A positive reversal on the weekly chart can be expressed in one of two ways. A stock turns negative during the week but then reverses higher and finishes the week up in strong volume. The second way is for the stock to erase a good part of the loss and finish in the upper 60% of the week's range, also in strong volume.


Both scenarios — when accompanied by heavy volume or at least volume up from the previous week — express the same reality. Funds are stepping in to buy shares.


ArcSight, a company that **Hewlett-Packard** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) bought in October 2010, debuted on the Nasdaq in mid-February 2008.


This was a tough time to launch an initial public offering. The economy was in a recession, and the major indexes were struggling.


ArcSight corrected as much as 68% as it formed a base. In most circumstances, that would be far too deep to be a desirable base. However, the Nasdaq corrected as much as 56% during the bear market, and growth stocks normally correct more than the indexes.


ArcSight's base was showing strength. As the stock formed the left side of the base, it showed positive reversals in two weeks **1**. Volume was either rising or above-average in those two weeks.


On the right side of the base, ArcSight delivered five positive reversals in either rising or above-average volume **2**.


A second thing to look for in the base is a shakeout that forms a handle. This involves a low-volume decline that scares out weak holders.


ArcSight formed the handle during a 23% decline over six weeks **3**. The stock broke out in March 2009 **4** and advanced 165% in eight months.

If you're going to do something, you might as well do it halfway.

Have you ever had a coach tell you that? Probably not.

Instead, you've likely had your mentors urge you to go all the way â€” not halfway.

IBD has sounded a similar note as it's explained its CAN SLIM investing strategy over the years. This approach is best adopted 100%.

If you follow just 50% or 75% of the rules, you're still apt to get hurt.

After all, CAN SLIM incorporates the main qualities that growth investors should demand from a stock if they want a gain rather than pain.

Take a look at the graphic for a recap of the strategy.

It's all in there: big profit and sales growth (C and A), new conditions (N) and a sufficient supply of and demand for shares (S), as well as focusing on leaders (L), institutional sponsorship (I) and the market's general direction (M).

Which of those qualities do you think you can safely ignore?

None of them. A stock that has all vital individual aspects can still fall sharply if, for instance, the market has topped and is going lower.

Sure, you occasionally see a stock that falls short in one area but still ends up a big winner. However, that just happens every now and then. If you want to improve your odds as a growth investor, then always stick to CAN SLIM's main rules.

This doesn't mean that all of your stocks must have the same impressive growth profile as **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), China's No. 1 search engine.

It can be an excellent strategy to also hold some other names that are growing but historically not as volatile.

One stock in this camp would be business software giant **Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)), a big-cap issue that has often claimed a spot in the IBD 50 or Big Cap 20.

So what does it mean to follow CAN SLIM 100%?

It means that you shouldn't mix various investing approaches together, add a pinch of your own biases and then expect a tasty result.

IBD has found that some men especially struggle with adopting the CAN SLIM strategy completely. This is particularly true for guys who have accomplished a lot in their careers, say as business owners, doctors or scientists.

These confident types are sure that they can create a hybrid approach that's even better than pure CAN SLIM. But when they take that route, just following 50% or so of the rules, it usually doesn't go that well.

IBD's founder and chairman, William O'Neil, warned against mixing methods at an advanced workshop last June in Santa Monica, Calif. He cautioned attendees about using a number of charting services, saying it could lead to confusion.

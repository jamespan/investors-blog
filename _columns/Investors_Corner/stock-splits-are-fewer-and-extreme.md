When a stock splits its shares, especially in the manner of 3-for-1 or 4-for-1 or more, it often marks the top. As regular readers of this column know, too many [large stock splits](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/758404-excessive-stock-splits-can-mark-a-top.htm) offer alert investors a [timely sell signal](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx).

  

But the market also can offer subtle changes. Nowadays, there are fewer splits.

  

Some company managers think nothing of letting their stocks run up to \$100 or \$200 a share, or even \$1,000. But among this small subset of leading stocks, you might encounter an extreme share split.

  

The sharp increase in shares outstanding will have long-term consequences. But if the stock's fundamentals and technicals are very strong, there might not be any negative effect in the near term.

  

Here's a dramatic statistic: When the IBD 100 (which later became the IBD 50) was unveiled on April 14, 2003, not a single issue traded above the century mark. The highest priced stock? It was **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)), which traded near 88.

  

Fast forward to the IBD 50, published July 1. Thirteen names were priced above 100. **Regeneron Pharmaceutical** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) is just north of 500.

  

Eleven of the original 100 traded in the teens. Only one of the most recent IBD 50 stocks trades below 20.

  

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) in the late 1990s is typical of what usually happens. Its stock split three times in the 1998-1999 bull market. On the second, a 3-for-1 split in January 1999, the stock shot up 50% in a week to a price near a December 1999 high that it would not surpass for 10 years.

  

Also in the dot-com boom, **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) split 4-for-1 in the last week of 1999. From the Nov. 2 stock-split news to the ultimate high on the first trading day of 2000, the stock rocketed 250%, topping at precisely 200.

  

A more recent example is **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), which was trading above 800 when it split 10-for-1 in May 2010. The stock rose 16% that week, then built a two-month base. Baidu broke out again and advanced for more than a year. The top Chinese search engine then corrected for a year before breaking out again in September 2013.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) split 7-for-1 in June 2014. It seemed to have little effect, and the stock marched higher for months. The split seemed tailored to make Apple fit comfortably into the Dow Jones industrial average.

  

Now comes **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which announced a 7-for-1 split effective July 14 to shareholders of record July 2. The June 22 announcement had little impact on the stock. It will be interesting to see what happens.

  

Some growth companies have shown little interest in splits. **Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) saw its shares rise above 1300 with no split in sight. **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) rose to nearly 600 and has never split.

  

IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How To Make Money in Stocks" that he preferred to see companies split their shares 3-for-2 or 2-for-1 rather than conduct more extreme splits. Companies, he added, often split their stock extravagantly near the end of a bull market.

  

He said a stock is likely to top after the second or third time a stock splits. O'Neil's own study of winning stocks showed that only 18% had split in the year before they made their big move.

Even if you're relatively new to using IBD as a stock research tool, you've likely concluded at least a couple things about this unique website and weekly newspaper. One conclusion: The EPS Rating and the RS Rating, both found at [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) or in the stock research tables at IBD Weekly, give you a powerful and efficient way to uncover fast-growing companies.

But over time and especially after a few investments, you'll come to realize that simply picking up shares in a stock that has, say, a 97 Earnings Per Share Rating and a 99 Relative Price Strength Rating doesn't automatically lead you to a pot of gold.

You learn that other variables need to be considered.

The market is constantly changing. So are the strengths of stocks and their industry groups. A stock's chart may paint one picture this week, and another picture the next week. So it's smart to see IBD's rankings in context.

Here's an example. Is a stock with a 95 RS Rating at the start of a major bull market — such as March 2009 — the same as a stock with a 95 RS at the stock market's peak in October 2007?

No. The Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength ratings are relative measures. They simply compare one stock with others in IBD's immense database.

Always incorporate the state of the market (via the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500) in assessing the true health of a stock with IBD ratings. Then evaluate a stock's prospects with its chart.

Use the Current Outlook in the Market Pulse table that accompanies the daily [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) (read it today by hovering over the "Market Trend" section at Investors.com and clicking on "Big Picture"). The best time to buy stocks is when the outlook says "confirmed uptrend."

A couple more points about the nature of IBD's ratings: One, a long base may result in lower-than-usual RS and Accumulation/Distribution grades.

Two, new issues often have weaker ratings because they have a younger record of profits, or they have traded less than 12 months.

Three, the EPS Rating doesn't include estimates.

![ic_akorn_120716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IC_akorn_120716.png)When **Akorn** ([AKRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKRX)) broke out of a 12-month saucer at 15.59 in the week ended Aug. 9, 2013, a reader may have had reservations against the specialist in eye care medicines, topicals and injectable prescription drugs. After all, its EPS Rating was only a 64; the RS Rating was hardly better at 67.

The RS Rating reflected a stock that made no price progress after peaking at 16.87 on July 9, 2012. Akorn was still in base-building mode.

Yet Akorn's EPS Rating masked a solid profit turnaround, from a net loss of 27 cents in 2010 to earnings of 49 cents in 2012. So overall, Akorn showed a 93 Composite Rating, an A for SMR and A- for Accumulation.

After the breakout, Akorn rose 68% by December 2013. The stock took a break, fell hard enough to reset its base count, and broke out again in May 2014, this time surpassing a 28.10 cup-base entry, en route to new highs and stout gains.

  A Stock Rises Again After Its First Breakout Fails; Should You Buy The Second Time Around?

All too often, the leading growth stocks drop below their [buy points](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) only to bounce back above them. The big question for investors is, should they buy the second time around?




The answer is yes, so long as the break below the buy point is modest and shares don't spend weeks below the entry.


A minor decline is quite normal. Historically, 40% of stocks will dip back to or mildly below their buy points after a solid breakout, then resume their winning advances. So even when stocks exhibit power at the breakout, it's almost normal for them to recede to around the buy point.


But once a stock falls 7% or 8% below the [proper buy point in a good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), consider the breakout a failure. Such a loss [triggers an automatic sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). You need to forget about the stock unless it later forms a [new, sound pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


When To Buy On The 2nd Try
--------------------------


Sometimes stocks will give signals that they'll bounce back.


For example, the stock may make bullish price reversals or close near session highs on a daily or weekly basis. Or, the stock may bounce from a touch of the [50-day moving average](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). Both would indicate that institutional investors are buying on dips. Lacking those signals, a solid move back above the entry is still enough to make a purchase.

One other point: If a stock reclaims the buy point, volume may be lackluster or weak. While big volume is ideal, what's more important is for the initial breakout to have strong volume. It should be at least 40% more than the 50-day average (which is found in [IBD Charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) and [IBD quotes](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-sina-corporation-sina.htm?fromsearch=1)); expect small and mid-cap stocks to show even higher volume, double or triple average.


Also, make sure the [IBD current outlook for the stock market](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) is in a positive state. You can check this in seconds by either seeing IBD's [Market Trend page](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), reading [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), or going to the [IBD ETF Market Strategy](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/).

Chinese internet company Sina broke out Aug. 7, 2017, past a 97.89 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/); a few days later, it was below the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares sank no more than 6% from the entry, so there was no [loss-cutting sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). Instead, Sina found support at the 50-day line; on Aug. 11 it reversed higher **(1)**, a bullish sign.


The stock rose back above 97.89 the next session and sailed to 119.20 in five weeks, resulting in a robust gain of 22% and a [good time to take profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/). (Sina no longer trades in the U.S. stock market.)


Whenever a stock spends several weeks below the [ideal buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), unable to reclaim it, then the situation is more delicate. Chances are, the stock will [form a new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) and investors must wait for the pattern and new entry to develop.


Leading Growth Stocks: A Big Winner In Enterprise Software
----------------------------------------------------------


**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) broke out past a 38 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on July 25, 2017, and soon fell back below it. But instead of reclaiming the entry, the stock wound up forming a new base the next 10 weeks.


The breakout from that August-early October formation at 39.35 was successful for the work-collaboration software maker.

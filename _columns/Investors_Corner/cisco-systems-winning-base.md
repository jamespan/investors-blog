  Cisco's Base Had All The Right Characteristics

The 1990 bear market took 22% off the Dow Jones industrial average between July 17 and Oct. 11. Then on Oct. 18, the fifth day of an attempted rally, the Dow rose 2.7% in volume greater than the previous day. It was a follow-through day that signaled the beginning of the great bull market of the 1990s.


And one of the greatest stocks of that bull market broke out the next day: **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)). It would march 1,602% higher in the next 169 weeks. It would ultimately top in 2000 after running up an incredible 75,000%.


On the day it broke out, it had an EPS Rating of 99 and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 97. The three-year annualized EPS growth rate was 257%. It had nine straight quarters of big quarterly earnings increases. Estimates for 1991 earnings called for a 145% increase. Pre-tax margins were up 33%, and the return on equity was 36%.


Cisco set up in a double-bottom base. The time to buy was when the stock was completing the base's W shape, and the buy point was the high of the middle peak plus 10 cents. That price was 27.10. The second leg undercut the first **(1)**, an important characteristic for a double-bottom.


An investor would have had to be alert to be on top of Cisco. It had hit bottom just seven days earlier, gapping down to a new low. Besides sterling fundamentals, the stock was a fast-growing [new issue](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) undiscovered by many institutional investors.


Fast-growing new issues are fertile hunting grounds for growth investors. The stock had set up in a cup-with-handle base and broke out on June 5, but the base failed. Stocks were getting wobbly as the bears approached. The lesson of that base failure is that if you're forced out of a stock with a loss, don't give up on it. It might set up again. And that's just what happened with Cisco.


When it broke above the buy point, it gapped up and finished the day with volume 328% above average. A few days later, the stock pulled back intraday to 26.50, just below the buy point **(2)**, then closed with a gain for the day. That was a nice shakeout.


There's another rule that would have allowed the alert investor to get in earlier: [Famed investor Jesse Livermore's Shakeout + 3 rule](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/441893-shakeout-plus-3-offers-twist-on-double-bottom.htm?ntt=shakeout+plus+three). For stocks trading below 30, buy when the stock is 3 points above the first low. In Cisco's case, that was 22. So the buy point was at 25.

  Knowing Market's Direction Is Key To Investing Success

The most important letter in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system is the last one â€” M, which stands for market direction.


It's daunting to make sound investment decisions without knowing whether the market is heading higher or lower. Knowing the market's direction is one way the CAN SLIM system helps you to maximize your gains while minimizing losses.


"If you're wrong about the direction of the general market, and that direction is down, three out of four of your stocks will plummet along with the market averages, and you will certainly lose money big time, as many people did in 2000 and again in 2008," wrote IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


By the same token, if the market is heading higher, three out of four growth stocks will rise.


Learning to determine the market's direction takes some time, because it involves learning how to analyze the charts of the major stock averages. You can learn to do your own analysis by attending IBD workshops, for example.


For a quick read on the market's direction, plug any ticker into the Stock Checkup and scroll down to the "General Market and Industry Group" section.


In IBD, check the Market Pulse, a short table that runs each day with [The Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm), IBD's daily analysis of the market. Today.


The market normally is in one of three conditions: a confirmed uptrend, when buying and holding stocks is most successful; a correction, when it's best to avoid stocks altogether; and an uptrend under pressure, when topping signals appear but a correction is not obvious.


A serious investor needs to understand as much as possible about the action of the major indexes.


For that, The Big Picture is must-reading. Each day, IBD market writers break down the price and volume movements of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and NYSE composite and of the leading stocks, noting the significance of those movements.


One of the most important market signals is distribution. That's another term for market losses that occur in higher volume, a good indication that institutional investors areparing their exposure to the market. That's why the Pulse keeps track of them.

What is IPO investing? One way to answer this important question is to ask a couple more questions.




Would you invest in a new company with dynamic products that are transforming its industry and the world? Or prefer a much older firm that has seen its growth curve flatten out and whose shares are barely keeping up with the major indexes, or even lagging them?


If you are seeking the best new investment opportunities in stocks to build wealth, then you want to keep an open mind to [IPO stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/), or initial public offerings.


But before investing in an IPO, be sure to know what is an IPO and how to invest.


Learn these time-proven rules on [when to buy IPOs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), when to sell shares to maximize profits and minimize losses, and how to find the best stock ideas.


What Is IPO Investing?
----------------------


An initial public offering, or an IPO, is a company's first offering of stock to the public. Until a company goes public, individual investors are mostly unable to invest in the company. But once the stock is trading on a stock exchange — like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq — any investor can purchase it.


A company "goes public" for a number of reasons, but primarily to raise capital to expand and grow operations. If the company's plans are successful, the stock price should rise, rewarding early stock investors.


An IPO can also be an opportunity for venture capitalists and other early investors to cash out and take profits.


How To Trade IPOs
-----------------


When a stock goes public, the first day of trading is very volatile. With no trading history or prior stock quotes, no one can really be sure of a fair market-based price for the stock. Investors should be patient and wait at least several weeks for a [potential base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


[An IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) can only occur in the immediate aftermath of a stock's debut. [The IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) can be as few as two weeks in length. For example, Google went public on Aug. 19, 2004, consolidated sideways for three weeks and then blasted higher on Sept. 16 above a 113.58 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Just one year later, the stock was over 177% higher.



Successful IPO Stocks
---------------------


Past successful IPOs include vaunted [FANG stocks](http://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) Google — now **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) — in 2004 and, more recently, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) in 2012. Both stocks continue to perform as market movers despite their huge moves since their market debuts.


Currently, Alphabet is shaping the right side of a [new base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).


Meanwhile, Facebook is still on the mend after the stock's nearly 44% slide from its 52-week high near 219. The social media giant broke through [key support levels](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) and triggered a [sell signal](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/) from a 188.42 [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on disappointing Q2 earnings on July 26, 2018.

Even foreign-based companies can offer a tremendous amount of opportunity. **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) went public on the NYSE on Sept. 19, 2014. Last year, the Chinese e-commerce giant went on a tremendous move after breaking out above a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a buy point of 104.67, according to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) chart analysis.


The stock is currently trading around 20% off its all-time high of 211.70 amid a correction that stretches back to June 2018.


An IPO That Didn't Work Out
---------------------------


However, not every alluring IPO turns out to be a successful investment.



**Spotify** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) debuted on the NYSE on April 3, 2018, with an IPO price of \$132 per share. Shares quickly created an IPO base with a 169.10 entry, which quickly failed. Next, the stock shaped a flat base with a 171.33 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Despite an initial profit, the stock would eventually give up support at its 50-day line.


By December, the stock has dived more than 48% below its 52-week high price.


How To Find IPO Stock Ideas
---------------------------


Newer companies with solid fundamentals can be found in the IBD [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) screen. It has special screening criteria to find up-and-coming stocks with strong fundamentals and technical traits. Plus, [read a story](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) that highlights one or a few of the current stocks on this valuable growth stock list.


Current members of the list include [advertising platform](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stock-trade-desk-stock-buy-point/) **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and Chinese music streaming platform **Tencent Music Entertainment** ([TME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TME)).

Others have been around a long time yet keep refreshing their products and services in the same manner as a young member of the Nasdaq or NYSE.


Is This New Issue A Potential Market Leader?
--------------------------------------------


On Dec. 12, Tencent Music Entertainment debuted on the NYSE. Shares of the [Chinese IPO stock](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stock-tencent-music-buy/) broke out past an IPO base's 14.85 buy point on Jan. 22, but quickly faltered when they fell more than 7% below the entry on Feb. 1. Tencent Music has since rebounded sharply enough to hit new highs. Be on the lookout for a new base to form.

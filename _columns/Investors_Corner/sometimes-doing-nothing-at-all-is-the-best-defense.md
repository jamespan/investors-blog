  Sometimes Doing Nothing At All Is The Best Defense

Master Po always had the answers on the 1970s TV series "Kung Fu."


"Grasshopper, be like still water. Only then will you see failure in the price-and-volume action of a wide-and-loose stock consolidation."


Actually, Po never said that.


But if your trades often fail, it could mean you're not seeing all that a master investor would see.


It's often the trades you never make that best protect your portfolio. The 8% sell rule is necessary to limit losses, but if you recognize flaws in a stock's base and don't buy, you've held your loss to 0%.


Isn't inaction far better than a string of small losses?


Foresight that matches hindsight on the accuracy gauge is hard to come by. That's because greed, hope or fear can lead to false readings.


Do not let feelings guide your trades. Closely study a stock's fundamentals, its base -- and the quality of the overall market -- before buying a stock.


In the fall of 2009, the bull market was well under way. The indexes had been rising since the March 12, 2009, follow-through day.


On Oct. 19, 2009, Orion Marine Group cleared an alternative 23.70 buy point in 43% faster than usual trade (1). The general market was in a confirmed uptrend.


Euphoria can get the better of an investor when the good times are rolling. Stocks had been doing well for months. Money was being made. Why not just jump on Orion's breakout?


After all, Orion was No. 27 in the IBD 100. The Composite Rating was 90. The EPS Rank was 98. The RS Rating was 89. The base formed in the aftermath of a failed breakout. So, the pattern remained early-stage. What was not to like?


Quite a few things. Orion's Building-Heavy Construction group was No. 158 among 197 industry groups. The sector was a laggard too -- 24 of 33 sectors.


Orion's fundamentals had flaws. Return on equity was 14% -- below the 17% minimum associated with elite stocks. Sales growth was 5% in the most recent quarter. And the stock was thinly traded (2).


Also, the unidentified consolidation wasn't truly a base. It was too deep to be a flat base and too choppy to be a cup. Finally, each successive low was slightly higher, not providing a healthy shakeout (3).


Orion's breakout went nowhere. It triggered the 8% sell rule a handful of days after the breakout.

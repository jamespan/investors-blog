*Sixth In A Series*

  

One reason why a great stock bursts out of a base and sprints to new highs is all about surprise.

  

When a company reports quarterly profits that beat Wall Street's consensus view by a mile, or it revises its yearly sales forecast sharply up, demand for shares often explodes. The stock then surges, sometimes gapping up in price.

  

As you build a watch list, embrace caution toward those stocks that are followed by a plethora of sell-side analysts — those who work for investment banks and brokerage firms. Such an environment makes it much tougher for a company to meet or exceed expectations.

  

Analyst coverage is good for growth stocks. Their research helps generate interest among institutional investors. Too many analysts, however, implies that the story has become too well-known. Their forecasts may become too rosy, which increases the chances that a company will underdeliver.

  

As an individual investor, stay disciplined. Disregard analysts' ratings, targets and opinions. Instead, focus on stocks with high EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings and rising fund ownership. When a stock breaks out of a good base to new highs in hefty volume, you know that demand is strong.

  

How many analysts are too many? According to Thomson Reuters, which tracks the research of 274 brokers, dozens of stocks have 30 or more analysts covering it. Five stocks, including **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), have 40 or more brokers covering their trails.

  

**Research in Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)) was a market leader in the mid-2000s. Not anymore, despite the fact that 54 analysts cover the BlackBerry maker. The stock has slumped 61% below its February high of 70.54.

  

With billions of dollars in sales, these companies are bellwethers for their industry. But it's growth that counts, not absolute figures.

  

Compare that with some lesser-followed companies.

  

Watchmaker **Fossil** ([FOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOSL)) (which is followed by nine analysts), **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) (17 analysts) and **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)) (seven) were all highlighted in the Sept. 3, 2010, edition of Your Weekly Review. Each broke out and made big gains.

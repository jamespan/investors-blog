There's perhaps nothing better than hitting a home run in the stock market.

  

Gains of 100% or more are not easy to come by, but you can find them in the early stages of a confirmed market uptrend by latching onto a growth stock that breaks out of an early-stage base.

  

But a common pitfall for investors is trying to hit too many home runs. Lock in one triple-digit gain and it's easy to think more will come your way. Truth is, triple-digit gainers in the market aren't exactly a dime a dozen. Singles and doubles can pump up a portfolio as well.

  

A key IBD sell rule is to sell a stock when a gain reaches 20%-25%. The rule applies during market uptrends where volatility is scarce and distribution days in the indexes are well contained.

  

The only exception to the rule is when a gain reaches 20% within a one- to three-week window after a breakout. In this case you could be holding a big market leader, so the rule is to hold the stock for eight weeks. After that time has passed, you can decide to take profits or hold longer.

  

**Sturm, Ruger & Co.** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)) was an easy stock to hold after it cleared a cup-with-handle base during the week ended Sept. 13. The buy point was 56.98.

  

The market was in a confirmed uptrend at the time, with scant distribution days. It rallied for several weeks, then paid a visit to its 10-week moving average in late October and found support **(1)**. Such action is typical when institutional investors favor a stock.

  

Ruger's gain from the breakout hit 25% during the week ended Nov. 8 **(2)**. But the stock's ascent soon began to slow and it started to consolidate gains in early December. (See today's [Stock Spotlight]( Investor's Business Daily) for a current analysis.)

  

A variation to the 20%-25% sell rule can be implemented after a lengthy run-up for the market or during a choppy uptrend â€” when distribution days increase in frequency. In this case, taking profits at 10%-15% is sound strategy.

  

During market choppiness, IBD's outlook in the Big Picture will often shift from "Confirmed uptrend" to "Uptrend under pressure." A steep rise in serious distribution days can often cause problems for breakouts, so keeping breakouts on a tight leash is sound strategy.

  

It's OK to buy breakouts when a market uptrend is under pressure. But a defensive approach tends to work best because the odds aren't in your favor for making a meaningful gain.

With thousands of stocks to choose from, trying to find a winner is like looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack. IBD's Screen Center can help make life easier.


Investors don't have to sift through stacks of financial statements and annual reports or eyeball thousands of stock charts to find potential buy candidates. Instead, you can get ideas quickly with just a few mouse clicks.


From the Investors.com home page, hover your mouse over the Stock Research tab. Then click on Screen Center once the secondary navigation pops up. Inside Screen Center, you'll find a wealth of pre-filtered, fundamentally and technically oriented screens.


• **Screen Of The Day:** A collection of 10 separate rotating screens. Among the screens you'll find are stocks showing fast growth rates as well as those that have strong profit margins. There's also a screen of stocks with surging Relative Strength Lines and those showing rising institutional ownership.


• **Top Sector Performers:** Top-rated stocks in different sectors.


• **CAN SLIM SELECT:** A list of market leaders that meet the strict criteria set by each letter in the CAN SLIM model for great stocks.


• **International Leaders:** Top foreign companies listed on U.S. exchanges.


• **Tech Leaders:** Four individual screens showing highly ranked stocks from Internet, electronics, medical, telecom and computer groups.


• **IBD 50:** A list of market-leading growth stocks.


You can get a more detailed explanation of each screen and the screen's criteria by clicking on each screen name.


Results can be viewed by fundamentals, SmartSelect Ratings or price and volume. Once you get your results, you can quickly get a Stock Checkup, view a chart or add the stock to the My Stock Lists feature. Results can also be exported into a spreadsheet or text file. Screen Center is updated each market day at about 6:30 p.m. ET.


Use Screen Center to help you build your watch lists so that you'll be ready to buy when the market is in an uptrend. Even if the market environment isn't conducive to buying, you should always be ready with a shopping list.


Having to scramble at the last minute can cause investors to miss out on buying what could be a big market winner.

Some of the biggest keys to fundamental analysis are examining a company's past record of earnings-per-share growth, current growth and the prospects for growth ahead. [EPS growth](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/789914-how-to-use-the-eps-rating.htm) drives a stock's performance, so it makes sense that this should be a focal point during the research process.


But analyzing earnings is just one part of fundamental analysis. It's also important to have a good handle on sales, profit margin and return on equity.


IBD's SMR (Sales + Profit Margin + ROE) Rating looks at all three and assigns letter grades of A to E for each stock. A-rated stocks are in the top 20% of all names in IBD's database. E-rated stocks are in the bottom 20%.


Sales growth should be robust, preferably in the 20% to 25% range or higher, both in recent quarters and at an annual pace.


Profit margin answers the question: How many cents in profit does a company generate for each \$1 of sales? If a widget costs 50 cents to make, and the company sells it for a buck, the gross profit margin is 50%. There's no benchmark percentage for profit margin, as margin varies by industry, but it is good to see annual pretax margins and quarterly after-tax margins at or near peak levels when evaluating a stock.


Return on equity (ROE) helps separate well-managed companies from poorly managed ones. It's also expressed as a percentage. It's calculated by dividing net income by shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Be careful, though. High return on equity can be a result of a heavy debt load. Look for high-ROE firms with low or zero debt. IBD's study of past market winners showed an average annual ROE of 17% before a major price move.


While investors' focus should be on stocks with high SMR ratings, keep in mind that a new issue might fall a bit short in this rating because the company is still in the early stages of its business, just on the verge of profitability. If the stock passes muster in other key fundamental and technical areas, a lukewarm SMR Rating shouldn't be a deal breaker.


**Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) recently had an SMR Rating of A, helped by big sales growth in recent quarters, plus a pretax margin of 41.7% and return on equity of 52.3% in 2014. But institutional investors have been selling shares in spades in recent weeks. The stock could be in the early stages of breaking down from a late-stage base.


As for **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)), strong sales growth, profit margin and return on equity give it an SMR Rating of A, but it's been hit hard by institutional selling in recent months due to concerns about future growth. Last week, the company announced job cuts and issued weak sales guidance due to poor holiday sales. Despite a solid SMR Rating, the stock is almost 90% off its 98.47 high.


**Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) owned an SMR Rating of A when it blasted out of a cup-shaped base in late October 2014. The high rating was helped by annual pretax margin at the time of 17.1% and return on equity of 24.2%. Quarterly sales growth was stellar, showing year-over-year growth in excess of 25%.

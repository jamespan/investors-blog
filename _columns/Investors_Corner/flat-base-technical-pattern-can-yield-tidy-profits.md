Growth stocks show strength in a down market in many different ways.


They can show tight weekly closes after a breakout, refusing to give up much ground.


Or, when they do pull back, they show supporting action at their 10-week moving average.


Another way great stocks show strength, either in a weakening market or in a bull market, is by forming a flat base.


The price structure has been seen for decades in model-book studies of past stock market winners by IBD. **Hilton** ([HLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLT)) formed one in 1967 before a 232% advance in little more than a year. And **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) formed one in the second half of 2003 in the early stages of a new bull market. It more than doubled in 70 weeks.


If you miss an initial breakout, watch for a potential flat base to form. It often appears after a stock breaks out of a cup with handle or a double bottom. In a flat base, the stock moves sideways in a tight price range for at least five weeks, showing a pullback of no more than 10% to 15%.


Flat bases that show wide-and-loose, erratic swings should generally be avoided. Some might work, but plenty of others won't. If institutional support is truly strong for a stock, trading should be tight and orderly.


The buy point in the flat base is 10 cents above the high of the left side of the base. A future Investor's Corner column will teach you how to identify earlier buy points in a flat base.


Current Sector Leader **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) formed a flat base in 2012 that spawned a bullish upward move. It first cleared a consolidation in late July. The flat base that followed formed in five weeks and showed tight trading with a pullback of 9%.


As the base formed, it paid a visit to its 10-week moving average **(1)**.


Gilead gapped out of the base at 35.25 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in early 2013) in the week ended Nov. 16, helped by news that a combination of its experimental hepatitis C therapies cleared the virus in all patients in a trial.


Weekly volume in the breakout week totaled about 166 million shares **(2)**, nearly double its average at the time.


Buying a stock when it gaps out of a base is counterintuitive, but those who bought Gilead on the Nov. 12 breakaway gap up in price have been rewarded nicely. Gilead is up 163% from the 2012 breakout.

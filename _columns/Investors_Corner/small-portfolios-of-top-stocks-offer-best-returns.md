Investors are often advised to diversify their stock portfolios to minimize risk. But IBD research shows that it's actually less risky and more rewarding to own just several carefully chosen stocks.

  

"The best results are achieved through concentration, by putting your eggs in a few baskets that you know well and watching them very carefully," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How To Make Money In Stocks."

  

To be sure, diversification can lower risk by reducing an investor's exposure to any one stock. But a big portfolio of 20 or 40 names can be unwieldy, leading to confusion and weak returns.

  

"Keep things manageable. The more stocks you own, the harder it is to keep track of all of them," O'Neil wrote.

  

He says investors should conduct thorough research and choose a limited number of stocks that can be followed easily. This involves first creating a watch list focused on industry-leading companies with top-notch fundamentals.

  

People with \$20,000 to \$200,000 to invest should limit their holdings to four or five stocks. Those with \$5,000 to \$20,000 should consider buying at most three stocks, and those with around \$3,000 should limit their holdings to two stocks, O'Neil writes.

  

Once a watch list has been created, the investor's job is to make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend and that the chosen stocks are hitting their buy points after forming sound bases.

  

The Big Picture column and accompanying Market Pulse box in IBD's B Section and the Stock Checkup feature at investors.com are good places to research current market conditions and individual stocks.

  

The research doesn't end after the stocks have been bought. It's important to keep an eye on the fundamentals of each and developments in their chart patterns, a difficult task with a big portfolio.

  

Often, stocks that have broken out will go on to form three-weeks-tight patterns or other structures that offer secondary buy points that allow investors to add shares.

  

In other cases, further research may reveal a new stock that looks poised for a strong run. As a result, it may be best to sell a lagging stock and move the cash into the new one, or into a better-performing stock within the portfolio.

  

"The winning investor's objective should be to have one or two big winners rather than dozens of very small profits," O'Neil said.

  

Diversification, he added, is "plainly and simply often a hedge for ignorance."

  

The S&P 500 gained as much as 13% from Jan. 1 through its recent high on April 2. That's nice. The table of stocks that broke out after the Dec. 20 market follow-through shows how it's possible to beat the market. **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), **InvenSense** ([INVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVN)) and others were able to enrich an investor's portfolio faster. Priceline moved from a 549.10 buy point to as high as 774.96, up 41%. When it cut through its 50-day line near 680 on May 10, an investor could sell and still reap a 24% profit.

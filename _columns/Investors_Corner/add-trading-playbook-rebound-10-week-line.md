Most institutions, as well as individual investors, hesitate to buy stocks at new highs. Everyone likes a good discount, so they wait for a pullback.




The 10-week moving average serves as a key area of potential support. Why? Institutions will use that moving average to add shares to existing positions. Use this investing behavior to your own advantage.


A rising 10-week line is positive, pointing to an upward trend in the stock's price.


While the first two to three pullbacks to the 10-week line are considered proper to buy, the very first pullback to the 10-week line following a leading stock's strong breakout can provide the most compelling opportunity to acquire more shares, or even initiate a position if you missed the initial breakout from a base.

Stock Trading Playbook: The Right Time To Re-Buy
------------------------------------------------


Check out **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), one of the biggest market winners during the 2014-15 time frame. The large cap currently holds a spot on the [watch list section of IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/watchlist).


The stock provided three separate classic situations in which to buy the stock.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ICpanw042919-300x169.jpg)First, the stock broke out of a [proper double bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) with a 72.60 [correct entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on May 29, 2014. Notice how the second leg undercut the first leg of the pattern, shaking out weak holders before moving higher.


Following the stock's breakout, the stock quietly formed a five-week [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with an 85.88 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) as the market underwent a brief period of weakness.


The breakout occurred on Aug. 13, 2014. In October, the first 10-week pullback occurred as shares fell back to the 10-week line **(1)**.


While the stock fell under the 10-week average during the week, it recovered strongly to end the week on a high note.


Over the next nine months, Palo Alto rose 176% to its ultimate peak at 200.55 from its double-bottom breakout. The 10-week line was a steadfast support level throughout the move. But in August 2015, the stock lost the 10-week line **(2)**.

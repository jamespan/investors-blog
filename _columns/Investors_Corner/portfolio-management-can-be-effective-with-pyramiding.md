There are two skills investors need to master to be successful: stock selection and [portfolio management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/calculating-position-size-for-portfolio-management/). Stock selection involves spotting industry group leaders and picking the best stocks at the right time. Portfolio management is knowing when to sell or add to your holdings.


What many investors may not realize is that you don't have to buy a stock all at once. In fact, a better way of investing is a portfolio management technique called pyramiding. This is where the investor makes multiple purchases of a single stock rather than buying all shares at once. By dividing the investment into multiple installments, investors can better control risk.




Buying all shares at once comes with added risks. While it's true that you have more upside potential with this style of investing, the downside is you can also quickly lose more money by going all-in.


With pyramiding, you're putting more money to work after a stock has proved that it can move higher. What you are doing is averaging up, not averaging down.


Portfolio Management With Pyramiding
------------------------------------


In a typical pyramiding scenario, you use half of the capital allocated for a single stock for the first purchase. So if you have \$10,000 to invest in a given stock, use \$5,000 for your first set of shares. A good way to start the position is by buying a leader once it breaks above a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-growth-stocks-positive-elements-of-a-base/).


From here, you could use 30% of your allocated capital, or \$3,000 in this case, for your second buy. You'd make the second purchase when the stock moves 2% above the initial purchase price, or correct buy point. Now you're 80% invested. If the stock rises another 2% or 3%, you could use the remaining 20% of your capital for the final buy.


Now you're fully invested.


Another example: You may decide to take an early entry and buy the initial leg of your position as the stock breaks above a [downward-sloping trendline](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/). Then, once the stock reaches the buy point from whatever base it's formed, you make your second buy with 30% of the allocated capital. Finally, you'd finish the position once the stock rises another 2% to 3% from the second buy point.


Another form of pyramiding is simply adding to your winning positions when new opportunities present themselves. Rather than adding only when shares exceed a prior entry by exactly 2% or 5%, investors may wait to see if the stock forms a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/), for example, to add shares.


An Example of Pyramiding Using MSFT Stock
-----------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IC2c041122-300x161.jpg)On Oct. 28, 2019, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) scored a breakout from the 142.37 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [narrow flat base.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) Shares gapped up on the breakout **(1)**, which would have been the ideal time to make an initial purchase of shares.


Following the breakout, the stock formed an eight-day shelf pattern that was only 2% deep. The stock rose to new highs on Nov. 8 **(2)**, presenting the first opportunity to pyramid your position.


Following this, shares ran up to 152.50 on Nov. 27 and then paused for nine days. This new shelf formed another area of resistance around 152.50. Shares cleared that level on Dec. 12 **(3)**, which would have  been the third and final purchase. Another way, you could have made the third buy when the stock was up 5% from the 142.47 entry.

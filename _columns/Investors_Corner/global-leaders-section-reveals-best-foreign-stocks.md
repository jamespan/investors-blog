Looking to latch on to China's Internet economy, rising consumer spending in Latin America or Ireland's booming drug industry? IBD's [Global Leaders column](http://news.investors.com/investing/global-leaders.htm), previously called International Leaders, helps to narrow your search for the best foreign growth stocks. The feature can also help allay anxieties about investing outside the U.S.

Many companies in the Global Leaders screen are based abroad but do a lot of business in the U.S. These current and former foreign leaders — like Canada-based **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and Singapore's **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) — also trade as American Depositary Receipts on the NYSE or Nasdaq. They also often appear in the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/), Sector Leaders and other columns that feature the best overall growth stocks.

IBD markets writers evaluate stocks in the Global Leaders screen by key IBD fundamental and technical gauges, such as Composite, Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength ratings. They're the same criteria used to select the best domestic growth stocks.

Argentina-based **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), the eBay of Latin America, appeared in Global Leaders on April 1, 2010, as it cleared a 48.91 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. At the time, the stock boasted a best-possible 99 Composite Rating: It was outperforming 99% of all listed companies based on five IBD metrics.

MercadoLibre had a rough ride at the start. The stock sliced through its 10-week moving average in the week ended May 7. However, it managed to buck the downturn and climb along its rising 10-week line, a sign of a true market leader. MercadoLibre gained 57% in nearly six months, hitting a high of 76.81 on Sept. 27 before correcting to form a new base.

The Global Leaders column may focus on a single stock like MercadoLibre, or it'll examine several names. Recent columns have featured stories on **Canadian Pacific Railway**'s ([CP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CP)) unsolicited bid for **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSC)); analysis of Israel-based chipmakers **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) and **Tower Semiconductor** ([TSEM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSEM)); and Q3 results by Chinese e-commerce firm **JD.com** ([JD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JD)).

The column may also take a look at trends in overseas markets shown in the accompanying Major World Markets map, which displays the daily and year-to-date returns of benchmark ETFs from 18 countries (see the map today on B14).

At the age of reason, children figure out the truth about the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman and Santa Claus. You can toss "investment guru" into the same mythical basket — except it's a fairy tale tailor-made for adults.


The investment guru is an awe-inspiring mystery. His success is believed to be a result of Superman-like talent.


Journalists like to create investment gurus even if it contradicts what the person says. It makes for a good story. Former Magellan Fund manager Peter Lynch, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil have each been called an "investment guru" by the media. But if you read the trio's own words on what it takes to succeed, you'll hear some down-to-earth advice.


It's mostly about hard work.


Lynch: "The more companies you examine, the more opportunities you'll find."


Buffett: "All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty."


O'Neil: "People think that in order to be successful, you have to be either lucky or right most of the time. Not so. Successful people make many mistakes, and their success is due to hard work, not luck. They just try harder and more often than the average person."


This is very bad news for slackers who dream of easy money.


The novelist William Faulkner once wrote about a character who had tried every method of making money "with the exception of work." If that's your approach to stocks, you will fail.


You need to give the market at least as much time as you would reserve if you were learning to play the piano well.


Here are a few tips to consider:


• **Take tiny steps and don't stop.** Read two or three pages each day from "How to Make Money in Stocks." When you've finished the book, start over again. Learning is a marathon, not a sprint.


• **Quit lying about how busy you are.** Be honest: You waste a lot of time. If you watch one less TV program a week or surf the Internet one less day a week, you'll no longer be too busy to study stocks.


• **Tune out the noise.** Ignore all those financial opinions. Focus on the market itself. The Big Picture, Market Pulse and "How's The Market?" page are designed to do that.


• **Stay in the present.** Calvin Coolidge said, "If you see 10 problems coming down the road, you can be sure that nine will run into the ditch before they reach you." This is also true of promises.


The secret of investing is that there is no secret. Even a little work done daily will improve your investing skills considerably.

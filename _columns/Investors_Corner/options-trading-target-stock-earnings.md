  How To Trade Growth Stocks: Why Options Trading Isn't As Risky As You Might Think

It's hard to remember an earnings season that's yielded so many [gaps up in price](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/). A parade of strong earnings reports in recent weeks has made for a vibrant options trading market.




While options trading strategies like protective collars, butterfly spreads and long strangles can get complicated quickly, a basic earnings options trading strategy allows you to capitalize on a bullish earnings report while limiting downside risk.


Consider for a moment: How many times have you bought a stock ahead of earnings due to bullish fundamentals and technicals? The company reports better-than-expected earnings and sales and issues bullish guidance, but the stock gaps down and you're sitting on a big loss.


The above scenario can be avoided with a basic call option strategy that allows you buy a stock at a predetermined price. Here's how the strategy works:


First, identify stocks set to report earnings with bullish charts. Some might be setting up in [sound bases](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/). Others might have already broken out but are [getting support at the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Still others might be trading tightly near highs, refusing to give up much ground. Avoid [extended stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) that are too far past [proper entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Options Trading 101
-------------------


A call option is a bullish bet on a stock. A put option is a bearish bet. One call-option contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a specified price, known as the strike price. A put-option contract gives the holder the right to sell 100 shares of a stock at a specified price.


Stocks trade either weekly or monthly options, and every option contract comes with an expiration date.


Once you've identified some bullish earnings setups, check strike prices with your online brokerage account. Look for a strike price just above the underlying stock price at the time (out of the money) and check the premium. The premium should never exceed 4% of the underlying stock price at the time. In some cases, an in-the-money strike is OK as long as premium isn't too expensive. Keep in mind that cheap premiums are often cheap for a reason. By the same token, pricey premiums are sometimes expensive for a reason.


In some cases, a pricey premium might be justified, especially if there's conviction behind the stock. When **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) reported earnings on Aug. 9, the premium was quite pricey, but the stock soared 37%. The premium for **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) was also well above the 4% threshold ahead of its June 11 report. Shares soared 30.5%.


Target Soars On Earnings
------------------------


Let's take a look at what a call-option trade looked like for **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) just ahead of its Aug. 22 earnings report. The retailer was [still in buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) after a breakout from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 79.69 buy point.



When shares were trading around 82.88, a weekly call option with an 83 strike price (Aug. 24 expiration) came with a premium of around \$2.40. This offered a trade with limited downside risk of 2.9% (\$2.40/82.88).


One contact gave the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Target at 83 for a cost of \$240 (100 x \$2.40). When taking the premium paid into account, Target needed to rise above 85.40 for the trade to start making money.

If Target had gapped down on earnings, the most that could've been lost on the trade was \$240, the amount paid for the contract.

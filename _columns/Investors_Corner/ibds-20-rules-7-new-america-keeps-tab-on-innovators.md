[IBD's 20 Rules](https://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/SpecialReport/583489/201109141435/IBDs-20-Rules-for-Your-Investment-Success.aspx): **An Investor's Corner Series**

_Seventh in a series_

An old rule of thumb among seasoned entrepreneurs holds that a successful product or idea is at least "15% new" compared to what's out there.

One of IBD's top investing rules guides investors to sniff out that key 15%: invest in entrepreneurial companies. Pay special attention to ones that went public in the last five, 10 or 15 years.

It's vital to find the "N" in the CAN SLIM investing mnemonic â€” companies with something new to offer, companies that are innovating toward new territory in their respective markets, companies whose markets have been shaken up and are in transition.

Such companies are under constant review in IBD's New America section, today on Page A6. The stories dig into the management, strategy and evolving markets of leading stocks. They provide a comprehensive first stop and periodic updates for investors' research.

Another informative feature is the daily AfterMarket box just above the New America articles. It tracks daily activity among recent new issues, with an emphasis on those with strong fundamentals.

IPOs tend to be companies breaking new ground. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) went public in 2006 with a fresh angle on fast-casual food service. **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) went public in March 1999 with a system that saved consumers money and allowed hotels and car rental firms to profit from otherwise idle inventory. **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), a June 2000 IPO, developed a new surgical method using robotic instruments.

Another breed of new issues are consolidators. **Waste Management** ([WM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WM)) went public in 1988 as a consolidator in the trash-hauling trade.

More recently, much of the consolidation has centered around the Internet. **OpenTable** ([OPEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPEN)) launched in May 2009 and began gathering Internet-based restaurant reservation services. **Ancestry.com** ([ACOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACOM)) is quickly expanding by acquiring online genealogical sites.

**Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) innovated by offering predictably good coffee and an updated twist on the old coffee shop theme. It acquired share by squeezing out local coffee shops, but also cultivated an entirely new era of coffee consumption.

Meanwhile, the beverage market has evolved beyond simply better coffee. A growing energy-drink audience breathed new life into old stocks like **Hansen Natural** ([HANS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HANS)) and **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)).

And while IBD research shows 80% of the stocks that had outstanding price performance in the 1980s and 1990s had been brought public in the prior eight to 10 years, not all the innovators are necessarily IPOs. Leading players in their industry continually strike groundbreaking new finds. One of the most innovative companies in the world today is **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which went public in December 1980 .

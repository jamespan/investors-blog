The new year is a perfect time for investors to look for companies with outstanding annual earnings and sales growth.

  

Don't forget also to look for signs of solid future growth.

  

Strong quarterly earnings increases are the most powerful indicator of winning stocks. But the "A" in CAN SLIM, for annual earnings, is a reminder that a winning company's financial performance must also show signs of longer-term durability.

  

The A-factor favors stocks with annual earnings and revenue growth averaging at least 25% per year over the past three years. That growth, plus the requirement for accelerating quarterly earnings growth, sets a high bar for leadership candidates.

  

Qualifiers have included **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), which quadrupled its earnings in 2006 ahead of a big run in 2007; **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), which grew EPS 175% from 2009 to 2011, helping fuel large gains from the start of 2012 to a 2014 peak at 1378; and **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), a big winner since 2003 that scored EPS increases of 72%, 78% and 157% from 2003 to 2005.

  

Investors can check three-year EPS growth rates and current year EPS growth estimates at Investors.com's Stock Quote page. The information is also on IBD [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) , along with an indicator of whether analysts are revising estimates up or down.

  

But go beyond the past. Look closely at annual earnings estimates for the current full year. You can find those figures on various websites, including Yahoo Finance and [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com/) .

  

Ideally, the full-year growth estimate should be north of 15%. The higher, the better.

  

Many companies bounce out of a slump and show strong earnings growth for a year. Countless others turn profitable after years of struggle and turn in a year's worth of accelerating quarter-over-quarter gains.

  

But the test comes in the fifth quarter, as such players run up against what analysts call "tough comparisons." A company must now measure up vs. a strong quarter in the year-earlier period. It may mark the end of earnings acceleration for many companies.

  

Annual earnings estimates are educated guesses and often turn out to be either overly optimistic or too negative. But they are a vital gauge of a company's projected performance in the coming year. The accompanying table shows firms with some of the strongest current forecasts.

Are two heads really better than one? Does a cat have nine lives? And can a pair of bases by the same stock produce a superb breakout?

People might disagree on the first two questions. But as regards the third, the answer is an indisputable yes.

The base-on-base pattern, which strings together two or more separate bases, appears frequently on the stock market landscape. Why?

Sometimes a stock is ready to break out to new highs and does so, but the rally does not achieve a 20% gain because the greater market is taking a break or even going into a correction.

When the market is shaky, stocks have a tougher time going higher. Most stocks follow the market's direction, that's all.

So, when the stock you have bought correctly and researched thoroughly did not produce the 20% profit that you had hoped for, despair not. Watch for a new base to develop on top of the earlier one. The new base's low can slip into the prior base, but ideally not by much.

**Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)), one of the largest firms in the vast oil and gas industry, created a pair of saucer bases before breaking out and achieving a 25% rally in 2014.

In the week ended Sept. 6, the Houston-based firm moved past an 85.12 entry on a super-long saucer with handle. The base was as long as an airport runway. (See it in its entirety on a weekly or monthly chart.)

Schlumberger's fundamentals were heating up. In the second quarter of 2013, earnings per share rose 14%. Not amazing, but the company has a long record of steady growth. It also marked the highest increase in four quarters.

The stock rose seven weeks in a row, up 11.5% to a 52-week high of 94.91 **(1)**. A new correction began. The decline pushed Schlumberger all the way back to its previous 85.12 entry **(2)** . In this situation, it's smart to exit the stock even with a tiny gain. A determined investor can always buy shares again.

The time to buy arrived several months later. The stock molded another saucer pattern that could also be seen as a flat base. The base's decline was a miserly 10.5%. Schlumberger's March 24-25 breakout past a new 93.94 handle entry came in big volume. On July 1, it hit a high of 118.76 â€” up 26%, ripe for a great sell.

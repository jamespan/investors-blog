Stock charts act as a guide in the market and are especially helpful in avoiding risky situations.

Here's one way to use daily and weekly price charts: Spot the stocks showing excessive volatility within their base patterns and avoid them.

Wide-and-loose price action is a major danger sign investors should heed.

Proper bases have tight, orderly price action, including several weeks that show small price spreads. Orderly price action signals that fund managers are quietly accumulating shares. Volatile price action points to uncertainty among big investors.

Excessive volatility is often a characteristic of late-stage bases and topping action in general.

In a wild chart, the action is constantly flipping up and down, in favor of the bulls one moment and the bears the next.

That's not the kind of action that supports a sustained advance after a breakout.

One way to measure volatility is to count the number of weeks in a base that have a price spread of greater than 10%.

One or two wide-ranging weeks are generally not a problem. In fact, a big spread with a high close and heavy volume near the lows of a base can be a key sign of institutional support.

But stay clear of charts showing excessive volatility throughout the base.

Base patterns that start volatile but later tighten up can be constructive.

To calculate the weekly price spread, take the high of the week, subtract the weekly low and divide by the weekly low.

Then multiply by 100.

In the week ended July 19, 2013, restaurant operator **Chuy's Holdings** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)) traded as high as 43.30 and as low as 35.80 **(1)**. Using our formula (43.30-35.80)/35.80 x 100 gives a weekly spread of 21%. This was the first of 12 weeks that showed a spread of more than 10% in an eight-month consolidation. The stock also swung above and below its 10-week line many times throughout the pattern.

On March 25, Chuy's broke out in heavy trade past a 42.49 handle in the consolidation. It rose only 2% past the entry before turning lower. Eight sessions later, the stock triggered a sell signal, falling 8% below the buy point. By November, it slumped 53% off its 52-week high.

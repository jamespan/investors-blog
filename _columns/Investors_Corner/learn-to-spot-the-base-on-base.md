**Handling A Choppy Uptrend:** *[Fifth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/621258/201208071356/handling-a-choppy-uptrend.aspx)*


Don't sneer at a base-on-base formation. You may think you're looking at an indecisive stock.


But base-on-base patterns also appear for stocks whose biggest problem is a rough market.


A stock forms a base. It doesn't even have to be a good base. As the stock rises, there's no guarantee the market will cooperate.


And, after all, the broad market is the M in CAN SLIM. Without it, you're swimming upstream.


So let's say the breakout faces a market that suddenly shifts into a correction. Or the market retains its uptrend, but in a rough and volatile fashion — like we've seen recently. That fresh breakout can easily stall in such situations.


What then? The stock's run could be dead. But many of these stalled leaders go on to form a second base. Here's how you know it's a base-on-base:


• Both bases are valid, although the first base can be flawed.


• The high point of the second base is no more than 20% above the buy point from the first base.


• The low point of the second base may dip slightly below the high point of the first base.


**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) showed a fine example in 1999 of how a breakout can run into a bad market, and how a stock can rectify an ugly base.


Oracle built its first base of the eventual base-on-base from February through September **1**. This cup-with-handle ran 49% deep and showed plenty of loose, sloppy trade.


This was an ugly base, and you couldn't be blamed for letting it pass.


Oracle broke out Sept. 3 **2** and floated to a new trading range **3** as the broad market moved into a sideways mode. The low of this range, 39.88, undercut the prior base's high by 3%. Lovely.


Seven weeks of consolidation tracked nicely with the Nasdaq. Then the market took off like an escaped convict, and Oracle was one of the leaders in what would become an historic run.


The stock triggered the new buy point from its second phase of the base-on-base on Oct. 29 and Nov. 1, running past 47.04.


So what did Oracle accomplish? By building a base-on-base, Oracle bided its time until the broad market provided the needed updraft. And that same base-on-base turned an ugly pattern into a tighter, neater base that you'd feel comfortable buying into.

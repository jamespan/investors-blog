One of the first things you learn when analyzing chart patterns is to pay attention to detail. It's the details that separate sound bases from unsound ones.

When it comes to the [cup-with-handle pattern](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/671025-cup-with-handle-base.htm?Ntt=cup-with-handle-base), for example, it's generally good to see a pullback of no more than 30% to 33% from the stock's intraday high to low. It's also good to see some heavy-volume gains as the right side of the base forms, as well as an orderly, low-volume pullback in the handle area. The tighter the trading in the handle, the better.

But there are always exceptions. Not every good cup-with-handle base will show perfect price action. In fact, market precedent shows that some past market winners were able to break out from relatively deep patterns.

So why were they successful? For starters, they were exceptional price performers in the market before they formed deep bases. Equally important was that their growth stories were still intact. As a result, it wasn't hard to attract renewed buying interest from institutional investors.

Keep in mind that how much a stock pulls back is often directly correlated to how much the market pulls back. A 15% pullback in the major averages, for example, will cause plenty of growth names to correct 20% to 25% or more. A 20% market decline may trigger some high-growth leaders to correct at least 40%.

Take a look at **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in October 2006. The stock was a market leader before it corrected 42% from January to July 1. Normally, that's too deep a decline for a good stock to recover. Yet Apple had a tendency to make big moves. Shares rose 200% in 2004 and 123% in 2005 as investors embraced its growth prospects.

As Apple built the right side of its base, its technical health strengthened, thanks to three bullish accumulation weeks in July and September 2. Institutional investors were seriously acquiring the stock again.

Apple formed a two-week handle area in October before breaking out over a buy point of 77.88 in strong volume.

Apple more than doubled over the next 12 months as the company stayed in growth mode, helped by strong Mac and iPod sales as well as the release of the iPhone in 2007.

When the company reported fiscal first-quarter results in January 2007, earnings jumped 75% from a year earlier while sales rose 25% to \$5.1 billion. Mac sales rose 28% as iPod sales surged 50%.

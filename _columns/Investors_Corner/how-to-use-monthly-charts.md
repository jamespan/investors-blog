Do you seek big gains in a single stock over, say, 10 years' time? Regular readers of this column know that some of the greatest market winners — from **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) to **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) to **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) — made huge price runs over many years. That's one reason why sometimes it pays to step out of the moment and look at the bigger picture.

  

That's the idea behind looking at a monthly price chart. At a glance, you can step back from the daily zigzags of the market to see years or decades of price and volume history.

  

[Monthly charts](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735776&sourceid=735786) are no substitute for daily and weekly charts, but rather just another tool at your disposal.

  

Each periodicity has its own strengths. [Use daily charts](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/746962-which-stock-chart-to-use.htm) to zoom in new bases and precise buy points. Weekly charts help you spot bases and recent waves of accumulation and distribution.

  

Monthly charts, in turn, give the broadest picture and most expansive historical context. You can view monthly charts for any stock in [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com) or [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/) by selecting the monthly tab in the upper left corner of the chart window.

  

With a monthly chart you can see if the current base pattern is forming within the context of a larger pattern, which is known as a base within a base. If a base breakout is coinciding with a multiyear breakout to record high prices, it can add to the power behind the move.

  

Monthly charts give perspective on a monster stock's advance. How far has it really moved? How many bases has it formed along the way? Does it have more gas in the tank? Historically, the top stocks advance for many months before topping.

  

In January 2010, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) was poised to break out from a 13-week [cup-with-handle pattern](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787). Chipotle's IBD ratings were mixed at the time of the breakout. It had a highest possible 99 Earnings Per Share Rank and a middling 54 Relative Price Strength Rating. The RS Rating was depressed because the stock was basing sideways while the overall market was charging higher. Its overall Composite Rating was a respectable 85.

  

A monthly chart shows this normal-sized base was part of the handle area of a deep cup-with-handle pattern that stretched back two years. This giant pattern was shaped by the severe bear market in 2008 and 2009.

  

Chipotle broke out from both patterns, advanced for 27 months and built four bases before undergoing a major correction in 2012.

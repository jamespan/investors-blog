Remember that new issue you bought awhile back this year when it was breaking out of a first-stage IPO base? Up 7% in heavy volume with solid fundamentals?

A thing of beauty. But instead of rising even more, the stock reversed in higher volume. Then it fell again. And again. Before you knew it, you were sitting on an 8% loss just a few days after the breakout. What went wrong?

It was the market.

To boost your portfolio's performance immediately, invest only when the trend is upward and rising, not downward and falling.

Major averages can show signs of distribution any time during a confirmed uptrend. When the selling intensifies, IBD's current outlook (see the Market Pulse today on B8) can quickly switch to "Uptrend under pressure" or even "Market in correction," the time to be cautious, sell stocks and wait for better conditions.

Never underestimate the 'M' in CAN SLIM. Just because it's the last letter in the acronym doesn't mean it carries the least importance. In fact, it's arguably the most important.

You might be great at identifying names that have potential to be big market leaders, but if institutional investors are selling and major averages are going down, great stocks will have a difficult time making headway.

How should you monitor the health of the broad market?

Along the top of A1, you'll find a quick summary of the day's action. In the B section, the What's The Market Trend? page shows big daily charts of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq with key data. Keep tabs on the market's leading industry groups over the past six months and the day's top movers.

The Big Picture, also on B8 today, guides investors through day-to-day market action, providing unique market commentary with a three-tiered market outlook scale: market in confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure, and market in correction. Money should be put to work in stocks during confirmed uptrends, while cash should be favored during market corrections.

It can be scary when heavy selling starts to hit the major averages and the market enters into a corrective phase. Growth stocks tend to fall at least twice as much as the broad market, so it's important to keep them on a tight leash when selling starts to intensify.

At the same time, it's also important to be ready when the market confirms a new uptrend with a follow-through day. Your confidence may not be high, but try to buy at least one stock. Get the vehicle in motion. If the follow-through day is strong, you'll gain more confidence and will be totally ready to scoop up more breakout opportunities.

The market's latest follow-through day caught some market pros off guard, but it was a viable one on Oct. 21 when the Nasdaq soared 2.4% in higher volume on the fourth day of its rally attempt.

Plenty of individual growth names were ready to participate. IBD 50 name **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) cleared a 91.16 buy point on the same day the Nasdaq followed through. It's been hitting new highs since then as shares remain under accumulation.

Other names that started to move around the follow-through day include **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Boise Cascade** ([BCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCC)) and **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)).

Lennar has proved itself the leader in IBD's home-building group. It's still holding comfortably above a 42.07 cup-with-handle buy point cleared last month.

 Selling on the way up into strength can be a tough task, but a bird in the hand is worth more than two imaginary ones in the bush.
Many leading stocks will top in an explosive fashion after extended uptrends. Learning to identify these unsustainable moves to the upside will be well worth it when the stock comes crashing back down to Earth days or weeks later. Such action, called the climax run or climax top, is a key sell signal, and it occurs as a stock's already long move begins to go parabolic to the upside.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ICnvda050417.png)Here are just a couple clues to confirm a climax top is taking place: a 25%-to-50% rise in a two or three week period; the stock peaks in price by rising in the heaviest volume in a single session since the run's start; and seven or more days up in a row.


You can read more aspects of the climax top and a number of historical examples on pages 263-268 in the fourth edition of William O'Neil's investment classic, "How to Make Money in Stocks."


A recent example is former market leader **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). The graphics-processing chip leader was hitting on all cylinders with accelerating quarterly earnings and sales growth and has its hands in a variety of compelling industries, like self-driving cars.


Nvidia's impressive move began on March 16, 2016, when the stock broke out of a cup with handle with a 33.16 entry (please see a long-term weekly chart at [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF2)). After [four successful tests](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-add-the-10-week-pullback-to-your-playbook/) of the 10-week line, shares began to show signs of climactic action toward the end of the year, nine months after the move began.


In mid-December, the stock went up 10 consecutive trading days in a row; shares ran up 26% over that period. The winning streak ended on Dec. 28 when the stock fell almost 7% on volume that exceeded 57 million shares, the highest daily volume since the beginning of the move.


Even on a weekly chart, Nvidia appeared as if the stock was going nearly vertical **(1)**.


After such a big move, it can be difficult to part with a stock with such tremendous potential, especially when all you see is further profits. However, in the next three trading days, Nvidia fell 17% from a 119.93 peak.


The stock gave you one last chance to get out while the getting out was good. Three weeks after the top in December, Nvidia found support at its 10-week line **(2)** and pushed into new highs ahead of its earnings release. Earnings disappointed and the stock slid 2.4%.


The next three weeks saw the stock crater 21% from its record high at 120.92. Almost three months after the top, the stock still sits about 14% off its all-time high of 120.92.


One of the more helpful features within [MarketSmith](http://marketsmith.investors.com/), IBD's institutional-quality research platform for individual and professional investors and advisors, is the ability to go back in time to study a former leader of the past's historical price-and-volume action. Simply change the date at the top center of the chart to move the end date of the chart.


 Other former leaders to study that topped in this incendiary fashion: **Bitauto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)) in August 2014 and **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) in October to November 2007. Bitauto would fall more than 80% from its peak, while SunPower would decline almost 98%.

IBD is elevating its stable of market tools with a new product that takes the process of buying and selling leading stocks step by step, practically in real time.

  

Working much like a portfolio managed by IBD, Leaderboard introduces new levels in which we provide investors with a compass to the market.

  

This online product follows leaders from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.

  

The leaders are constantly monitored, and significant changes are logged on a summary.

  

All key signals are marked on the stock's chart, with analysis illustrating the chart's condition and points where investors could make buy and sell decisions. The annotations have been specially designed to work with this product.

  

In another new way IBD assists investors, the Leaderboard charts include the 10-day moving average, which can be an effective tool for shorter-term trading.

  

The leaders list is one part of the whole product (leaderboard.investors.com). When stocks show topping action, they are placed in the Cut List, which also is monitored for significant changes.

  

Shareholders should consider taking profits or perhaps make short sales on these troubled stocks. The discussion of specific shorting opportunities is yet another new way in which IBD extends its knowledge to investors.

  

Subscribers also will find in Leaderboard three IBD columns readers are familiar with: The Big Picture, Stock Spotlight and Research Table Review. These columns are published online around 7 p.m. ET each day on Leaderboard. And throughout the day, you get IBD's market updates.

  

Several columns are exclusive to Leaderboard, such as a Weekly Big Picture and stories tracking the Leaders and Cut List.

  

The IBD 50 is enhanced in this new product, too. While the list is updated only on Mondays in IBD, on Leaderboard it is updated every day.

  

A Leaderboard subscription costs \$69 a month or \$699 a year. Check [www.investors.com/store](https://www.investors.com/store) for payment options.

When you stalk bases, most of the time the buy point is 10 cents above the high on the left side or the handle on a cup or double-bottom base. But sometimes you can get in at lower levels.

Not all stocks will form handles. Sometimes you can enter when a stock climbs past an area of logical resistance. **Copa Holdings** ([CPA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPA)) offered investors different ways to climb on board in the summer of 2006.

Before you even look at a stock's technicals, make sure it has good fundamentals. Earnings growth and sales growth are key. If a company isn't making money, there's no reason for its stock to go up.

Copa increased its earnings sharply before it went public. Its profit grew more than fivefold from 35 cents a share in 2001 to \$1.94 a share in 2005. Annual sales growth ranged from 4% to 52%.

The Panama-based airline debuted on the NYSE in mid-December 2005. New issues can sometimes be the fastest movers. The stock quickly ramped up to a high of 27.40 later that month before settling into a consolidation.

After falling to the low 20s, the stock bounced around in roughly a four-point range for months.

This set the stage for a new buy point at 27.50. But with shares trading around 22, the stock still had a lot of work to do.

Investors could get a lower buy point by drawing a trend line from Copa's Dec. 30, 2005, peak and connect at least three highs along the way. You would buy when the stock breaks above the trend line in heavy volume.

In Copa's case, the trend line can also be drawn connecting the highs in the weeks ended June 2, 2006 **1**, July 14 **2** and Aug. 4 **3**. That leads to an early buy point near 23.50. ([Click here](/NewsAndAnalysis/PhotoPopup.aspx?path=WEBcor0802.jpg&docId=580067)Â for a daily chart of Copa.)

Copa broke through the trend line in strong trading on Aug. 16 **4**. The Nasdaq had followed through just one day prior. Copa also zoomed past 24, where it frequently encountered resistance. Copa rose 176% in six months before carving its next correction.

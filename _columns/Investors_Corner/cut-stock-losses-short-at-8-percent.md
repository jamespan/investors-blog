As Investor's Corner begins a long series of columns on sell rules, none is perhaps more definitive or more frequently discussed in IBD than the 7% or 8% sell rule.

It is the cardinal rule of selling. It is easy to understand and to apply, and it has proven its worth over the years.

If you don't know it by now, the rule says to sell all your shares of a stock if it falls 7% or 8% below the price at which you bought it. That should be the largest loss you should ever accept on any investment — big or small. When the market is weak, consider cutting losses at even less — say, 4%.

This is a sell rule, but you should also consider it a portfolio-management rule. That's because keeping losses short and manageable is one of the most important lessons about investing.

By keeping losses small, you can afford to take several hits and more than make up for them with gains in other stocks of 20% to 25%, sometimes more.

A combination of small losses and solid profits will keep you ahead, even when your flops outnumber your wins.

**The Math Behind Stock Losses**

Cutting losses short also makes practical sense, if you do the math.

Say you bought XYZ Inc. at 55 a share. When the stock falls 6%, shares are at 51.70. To get XYZ shares back to the level where you bought them would take a rebound of 6.4% — not so insurmountable.

If you let the loss grow to 15%, it would take a 17.6% rebound to get back to break-even.

With a 25% loss, you're looking (hoping, probably) for a bounce of 33.3% to win back your losses. The bigger the hole, the more it takes to recover.

And for a stock to make up a 33% drop — which requires a 50% gain — is asking a lot.

The 8% point sounds arbitrary, but it really isn't. Research has shown that leading stocks, when purchased at the proper buy point, rarely fall more than 8% from their entries.

Of course, sometimes they do fall more than 8% and bounce back. What then? You may feel foolish for letting go of a stock that ends up being profitable. But you should not feel bad for being disciplined.

One option is to buy the stock again after it wins back the buy point in heavy trading. Make sure the market is in a healthy uptrend. Use The Big Picture every day (today, it's on B3) to confirm the market's trend.

**Move On**

More often, though, it pays to just walk away and find another opportunity.

Last year, homebuilding stocks were coming back as the housing market improved. **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) formed a couple of bases. A breakout March 20 past a 43.32 cup entry quickly fell apart.

Investors got another shot at the stock a couple of months later, when it cleared a narrow cup without handle **(1)**. Again, the breakout fizzled quickly. By May 29, the stock was 8% below the 44 new buy point **(2)**. It was time to sell. There would be no recovery in the stock for many months.

All the while, the general market was trending higher, generating better opportunities for investors.

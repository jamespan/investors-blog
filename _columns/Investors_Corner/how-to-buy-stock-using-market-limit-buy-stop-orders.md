The Internet age has made buying a stock fast, easy and cheap. It's as simple as sending money to a brokerage, logging on and pushing a button.


But before a novice investor takes the plunge, he needs to understand a few important things.


First, there are several types of stock orders, including market orders, limit orders and stop buy orders.


If you put in a market order, your broker will fill the order at the best available price as soon as the order is received. It's all but guaranteed to be filled, but there's no guarantee of the price you'll receive.


If your stock is liquid, meaning that there is sufficient volume so that individual trades don't affect the price very much, you should receive a price close to the last price. But sometimes, the situation can change quickly if lots of traders are trying to get in or out of a stock at the same time, or if the stock is thinly traded, meaning there may not be a seller at a price close to the last trading price.


Using a limit order allows an investor to buy at a specified price. Say you want to buy 100 shares of Apple at 400 a share, but it's trading at 420. You can enter a limit order to buy at 400.


If the stock dips to 400 or below, your order will be filled at the best available price. The disadvantage with limit orders is that the stock may never dip down to your price, instead only moving higher. Or, if the stock drops to your buy point, it might continue to trade lower.


A buy stop order will be filled if the price rises. This order might be used by an investor who believes a stock is about to experience rapid upward momentum, making it difficult to lock in a market order.


Say an investor believes a stock that is trading at 37 is about to break out to a new high at 40. He might put in a buy stop order at 40 or slightly above. If he's correct and the stock breaks out, his order becomes a market order at his stop buy price.


This is useful if the stock moves to 41 or 42 within a matter of minutes, or even seconds. There is no guarantee of price. If insufficient shares are available at his buy stop price, he might get an even higher price.


Or, if the stock moves up to touch his buy stop price and reverses downward, he might find himself with a losing trade.

History repeats itself. That's why you took the time in recent columns to learn about key base patterns that dominate stock-market history.

Don't look so surprised. After all, these bases reflect human activity which, in turn, is largely directed by emotions. It takes some greed to buy a stock to begin with — not necessarily an evil, killer-take-all avariciousness, just a desire for more.

Once you've bought a stock, fear takes over. What if something goes wrong? In fact, it often does. You may find yourself running far faster to get out of that stock than you ever did to get in.

You can take these two basic emotions and plot them on any of these base patterns.

Consider this: In more than a century of stock-market history, with so many thousands of stocks from every possible industry changing hands, seven bases keep recurring.

They are the cup-with-handle, the double-bottom, the flat base, the saucer, the square-box base, the ascending base and the high tight flag.

Let's examine the story offered by the cup-with-handle, the most common of these patterns.

You can label the cup's left side FEAR. The stock is falling; there's no telling how far it can go. Anything can fall 100%, but of course it wouldn't be building a base.

Enter GREED: He's the guy who puts his hands under the stock, palms up, catching what falls into them at what he thinks are bargain prices.

If GREED is big enough, he'll provide enough support to stem the decline. There's the bottom of your cup.

At some point, probably after some sideways movement, the sellers realize there's support under the stock. Some shareholders lose that sense of panic. They stop selling, or decide not to sell.

Buyers now can only add significant numbers of shares to their stake by upping their bids. The price rises.

There's the right side of your cup.

Re-enter FEAR. The stock rises to somewhere near the top of the cup, where all this trouble began.

A few investors are still holding this stock from those higher prices. Now they see a 30% loss pared to 5% or so. They're afraid the stock will retrace its recent gains, and so unload these losing positions.

So the stock falls again. But if it's any good, serious buyers will step in, providing the kind of support seen at the cup's bottom.

So the stock doesn't collapse, it slants mildly lower — a handle forms, like the one on a teacup. Volume dries up, as there's no sense of panic from bulls or bears.

Which brings us to the breakout. When the stock rises past the handle's high, GREED drives buyers to step up the pace.

There's suddenly no resistance, and they want this stock. Maybe there's some fear, too — fear of losing the opportunity to buy this stock before it gets away.

The Accumulation-Distribution Rating can be a crucial piece to a stock's puzzle when you're looking to build a portfolio of winners.

The rating, which runs from a best-possible A+ to a worst-possible E, analyzes a stock's price-volume action.

The better Accumulation grades reflect the footprints of large institutions building positions in that stock. The poor grades reflect a trend of unloading by the big institutions.

What are you looking for in a stock? Higher prices. You're looking for a pressure cooker with the lid about to blow off.

Too many stocks with promising attributes fizzle out. There is no pressure under the lid. Or worse, the pressure that's been building moves the stock the wrong way.

By analyzing a stock's price-volume action over a 13-week period, the Accumulation Rating helps you scent out what sort of pressure is under the lid. It helps reveal the big funds' hands before the price blows out.

Here are some things to look for. One, a rating of B or better. A C Rating is just neutral. You aren't looking for a soft simmer. You want the lid to blow off and hit the ceiling.

Two, watch the Accumulation Rating as the stock forms its base. You want its Rating to improve as the base takes shape. After all, a base is the first good clue you will find that a stock is finding support.

Three, the Accumulation-Distribution Rating will help you get into a stock, but is not meant to serve as a signal to get you out.

It can help you confirm that the stock you're tracking is building a sound base with support from the big guys. But when it comes to spotting the time to sell and lock in profits, watch the stock's price-and-volume action.

In the IBD Leaderboard, there are currently five stocks within buying range from a base or the 10-week moving average. Of these, just one shows an Accumulation Rating as low as C.

What does that prove? Probably that the market-moving institutions also have figured that these stocks are must-haves. They've been buying for at least 13 weeks, pushing the volume higher as they support the price.

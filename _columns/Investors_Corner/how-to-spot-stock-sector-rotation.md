Spotting market rotation in a timely fashion is difficult.


If your conclusion comes too late, it might be accurate but not actionable. If your conclusion comes too early, it might be actionable but dead wrong.


The difficulties are compounded because the whole exercise is more art than science. Yet, you can minimize the guesswork with a regular rotation-spotting drill.


IBD and Investors.com include a number of features that can give students of the stock market useful tools for spotting rotation. Let's look at how you might use IBD in a rotation-spotting drill. For a concrete example, we'll use Monday's Dec. 2 issue of IBD.


•Pages B1, B4, B6, The IBD 50: What sectors do most of the leaders come from? The medical sector accounted for 12 names, finance seven, and consumer and leisure five each.


The sector with the most names isn't necessarily the best place to look for buys. Many medical stocks are extended.


•B7, Stocks On the Move: This list has been quiet recently. But on strong market days, you can look for breakouts, or stocks rising in heavy volume. Make note of what sectors they hail from.


•B8, New Highs: For a fifth straight day, the bank sector led with 47 new highs. The bank sector broke a long run of new high leadership from medical stocks.


•B10, [Market Pulse](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm): Take a look at the stocks moving up or down in volume. Note any repetition from a specific sector.


Top 40 [Industry Groups](https://www.investors.com/pdf/IBD197_120513.pdf): You scan this listing from several angles. For now, the list generally confirms the leadership from medical and finance. However, several groups that weren't in the top 40 six weeks ago — such as Retail-Restaurants and Apparel-Shoes & Related — are now there.


•B11, Sector Leaders: The medical sector accounts for four of the 16 Sector Leaders. The financial and Internet sectors have three each.


The Smart Tables: Stock listings are arranged by the performance of the 33 sectors. As of Monday, the top five sectors were Internet, aerospace, office, leisure and finance.


•B13, Stock Spotlight: This screen of 16 stocks often identifies top performers early. Medical grabs three places, but the software sector also has three.


•B16, Top Fidelity Sector Funds: Year to date, the leaders are biotechnology and health care.


Top Sector ETFs: Solar and alternative energy take the top two spots here.


Groups With Best Percentage of New High Stocks: Medical-Wholesale Drugs and Building-Mobile/Manufacturing & RVs lead the pack.


•B18, [Major World Markets](http://news.investors.com/investing/international-leaders.htm) : The map can tell you something about rotation. Some countries make their living off commodities. Others are more consumer-oriented. The top performers now are the U.S., Germany and Japan.


•B19, The Market Indexes table: The top four performers since Jan. 1 are starred. As of Monday's IBD, the leaders were U.S. Defense, New America, New Issues and Insurance. Over the past three months, U.S. Defense, New America, Dow Jones Transports and New Issues excelled.


Make this a daily drill, and eventually it will prove useful. The key is to look at this over time and let it percolate. Try not to force conclusions; aim to see and recognize only what emerges.

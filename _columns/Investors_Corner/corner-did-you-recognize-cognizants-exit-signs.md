IT leader **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) flashed several sell signs earlier this year, as it cooled off following its big advance since 2009.

That's not to say that the tech outsourcer reached its ultimate top this year. It still might end up posting strong results and hitting new all-time highs.

But the stock certainly signaled that investors ought to at least consider locking in some profits following its impressive run.

The advance began with a breakout from a first-stage base in 2009.

Next, Cognizant cleared a second-stage, base-on-base pattern in the summer of 2010.

By late last year, it was working on a third-stage pattern, a five-week flat base **1**. This wasn't a sell signal, but investors should have been on their toes at this point.

After all, a third-stage base is a later-stage structure. Big gains are more likely to come from breakouts from first- or second-stage bases.

Cognizant still managed to add to its gains after breaking out past a 68.97 buy point from its third-stage base in December 2010 **2**. But there were only a few months left in its run.

You might have considered selling the stock on April 1 or April 21 of this year **3**. On each of those days, Cognizant hit a new all-time high in soft turnover (weekly chart is shown; please see a daily chart).

That can serve as a sell sign, especially given that the stock reached 83, up 20% beyond 68.97. Another IBD sell rule is to lock in gains once you have a 20%-to-25% profit.

Perhaps the most clear indication to sell at least some shares came in the week ended May 6.

That's when Cognizant sliced through its 10-week moving average in strong turnover **4**. Weekly volume came faster than at any point in the prior 52 weeks.

One more sell signal came in the week ended June 17, as Cognizant sliced through its 40-week line in heavy trade.

Weekly turnover was even stronger, hitting its highest level since 2009.

These days, Cognizant is working on a new base. The structure counts as a first-stage pattern, since the stock undercut the low of its prior base.

But the correction in this base is a bit deeper than ideal, coming in at just under 36%. Generally, the decline within a cup base should not exceed 33% to 35%.

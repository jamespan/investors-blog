When to sell growth stocks at the right time is a challenging task. It's tough not to wonder what you might have left on the table when taking profits in that hot stock. But it's better to speculate after the fact, rather than to risk having all of those gains cycle into a loss.




Of course, investors hope their latest purchase will double, triple or more in price. And some will, but such big winners are often few and far between.


Most stocks will pause to take a breather once they've run up about 20%. So a prudent rule of thumb is to [take profits when you're up 20% to 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) on most of your stocks. Even if you don't sell the entire position, it doesn't hurt to lock in some gains.


You can then use those winnings to open a position in another stock on your watch list. But what if you're convinced the stock you own isn't ready to slow down?


When To Sell Growth Stocks: Avoid A Round-Trip Of Big Profits
-------------------------------------------------------------


Whatever you do, don't take what's called a round trip. That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout.

RetailMeNot, which formerly had the ticker symbol "SALE,"came public with much fanfare on July 19, 2013, and closed 32% above its 21 offering price the first day. From there it rallied as much as 43% over the next two months before pausing to start its first base.


The stock formed a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/), which can produce big breakouts and strong gains. The base showed a 35% correction, on the deep end, but still within normal range. It then broke out past a 39.60 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) the week ended Feb. 14, 2014, in heavy volume **(1)**.


RetailMeNot extended its gains, soaring as much as 23% over the next two weeks **(2)**. Such a strong advance normally triggers the eight-week hold rule. This rule gives investors a chance to see if a stock has the potential to grow into a true market leader.


The Turning Point In RetailMeNot
--------------------------------


But on Feb. 28, 2014, the stock fell 11% in heavy trade, paring its post-breakout gain to 5%. Even though the hold rule was in place, that was an alarming drop. The next week, shares had dipped more than two points below the 39.60 [original buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) before finding support at the 10-week moving average **(3)**.


And by March 11, it closed 17 cents below the buy point **(4)**. Had investors not gotten out by then, they would have suffered a round trip.


While the market was in the thick of a bull run, RetailMeNot's fundamentals weren't pristine. Earnings fell 9% and 15% in Q2 and Q3 2013 before rebounding with a 73% gain in the fourth quarter. After-tax profit margins also narrowed during most of those quarterly periods.


Then RetailMeNot reported five quarters in a row of falling profits. By February 2016, the stock traded as low as 5.52 a share before getting acquired by Harland Clarke Holdings in May 2017 at \$11.60 a share.

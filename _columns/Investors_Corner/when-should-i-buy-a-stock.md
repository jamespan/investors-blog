A rookie investor might wonder why he or she should care about bases, or even what a base is.

Here's an easy way to understand it: Bases in investing are much like the bases in mountaineering.

If a climber is taking on Mount Everest, he or she cannot do it in a single day. There are camps along the way — on Everest a base camp and as many as four additional camps before the final run, depending on the path.

Likewise, most stocks don't leap to their ultimate peak in a day. If they do, either the peak isn't much of a climb or the days after reaching it are going to be wild and often ugly.

A normal stock's ascent involves weeks, months and sometimes years of gains.

The base is a place where the stock pauses to rest and get ready for the next move up.

Just as the air gets thinner in subsequent camps for the mountain climber, so it is with bases. A stock's energy level is often high out of the first and second bases. Beyond that, the climbing gets harder.

Let's go over some additional questions that rookie investors ask about bases.

•What does a base look like?

"How to Make Money in Stocks" and IBD University at Investors.com discuss characteristics of seven bases. The most common is the cup-with-handle pattern. Other patterns include the saucer with handle, double bottom, base on base, flat base, ascending base and high, tight flag.

Most truly sound patterns consolidate a minimum of seven to eight weeks.

•Are bases a safe place for stocks?

A stock can fail at any point.

Let's go back to our mountain-climbing analogy. Avalanches happen, and some conditions make them more likely: a heavy snow that breaks the ice slabs underneath; a windy day that adds to instability; and a loud cracking sound that says you should've heeded the earlier signs. Charts do the same for stocks.

IBD's anti-avalanche program for stocks: Get out if a stock drops 8% below your buy point.

•How should a stock act out of the base?

Ideally, the stock will quickly clear the 5% buy zone and create a cushion of gains. But sometimes the action will be hesitant after a breakout. Often the general market itself is a shaping factor.

In June 2013, **Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)) cleared a first-stage cup-with-handle pattern **(1)**. But volume wasn't strong on the breakout, and the stock had trouble making much progress. The stock gained 12%, then began to form a base-on-base pattern **(2)**. The base on base's lows were near the highs of the previous pattern — typical for a base on base.

Westlake broke out again and rose 29% in about six months; it formed a second-stage base. A fresh breakout on April 29 in heavy trading led to a 43% gain in four months.

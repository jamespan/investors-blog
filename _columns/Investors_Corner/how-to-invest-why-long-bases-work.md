When flipping through stock charts, an investor should look with a wide-angle lens.


Sure, a cup-with-handle base needs only seven weeks to be valid. But your focus shouldn't be primarily on that almost-two-month range. Many cup bases consolidate for much longer â€” some up to a year or more. You don't want to miss those longer bases.


The long cup can hold an advantage over shorter bases. Common sense suggests that the longer a stock consolidates, the fewer weak holders are present.


Uncommitted holders can be driven out two different ways. The anxious desire to break even can lead to selling. But weak holders also can be worn out by time.


In a short consolidation, the weak holders are probably holding shares through most of the base.


But if a stock consolidates over months or longer than a year, many weak holders will be driven out by their own impatience before the stock reaches break-even levels.


Other circumstances also can lighten the overhead supply.


In the case of the initial public offering, you sometimes don't have to worry too much about overhead supply. The stock might begin trading in light volume and leave the ranks of the thinly traded by the time it's climbing the right side of the base.


If daily volume is turning several times on the right side as it was on the left side, then there is likely plenty of buying power to absorb weak-holder selling.


And if the IPO is shaping a longer base, there's an additional advantage. The fickle money, which can make for wild swings in IPOs, leaves the scene during long consolidations.


So, the long base can be a friend to the disciplined investor.


**Rackspace Hosting** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)), a provider of cloud-computing services, launched its IPO in August 2008 **1**. The economy was in recession, and a bear market was under way.


After the first month or so of gains in relatively busy volume, the stock weakened. It also settled into a pattern of quieter volume **2**.


As the stock climbed the right side of a cup-with-handle base, trade picked up **3**. The stock broke out past a 10.36 buy point after consolidating for nearly nine months **4**. At the time, Rackspace had a maximum 99 Composite Rating, a 94 EPS and a 92 RS. Then the stock rose 118% in about seven months **5**.

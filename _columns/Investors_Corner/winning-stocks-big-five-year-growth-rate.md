  The 'A' In CAN SLIM Stands For Big Annual Growth

Plenty of companies can have a good quarter or two. But a track record of big earnings growth year after year is hard to come by.


That's why the "A" in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm stands for annual earnings.


Research into more than a century's worth of stock-market winners by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil has shown the big winners in any bull market cycle have shown extraordinary earnings growth before they started their big move.


This is why IBD tracks the annual earnings growth of a company over the past three to five years. Find it in the mini charts of [the IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/etables/default.aspx) (in today's IBD from Page B1), the [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing/stock-spotlight.htm) feature, IBD Big Cap 20 (on Tuesdays), Sector Leaders and other places that mini charts appear.


Investors should look for the annual growth rate to average at least 25%, but great companies often show rates of 50% or more. Strong annual revenue growth is desirable too.


If companies can put up those kinds of numbers year after year, it shows they are coming out with new products or services that are winning market acceptance and growing market share. They may also be able to produce goods efficiently and at a lower cost, boosting profits.


In the IBD 50, **Qihoo 360** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) had the highest five-year average growth rate at 232%, with **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) coming in second at 153%.  **Tangoe** ([TNGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNGO)) came in an impressive third with a five-year growth rate of 152%.


Some winning stocks don't have impressive five-year growth rates. They might not have an annual growth rate at all and still be a winner.


Two kinds of companies fall into this category: A company that has been bleeding cash for a number of years finally realizes the dream of its founders and becomes profitable. These are often new issues with cutting-edge technology or biotech companies.


Another kind is a turnaround, a company that ran into trouble and is getting back on the growth track. There were many such companies coming out of the Great Recession.


In both cases, companies without the "A" in CAN SLIM should be bought only if they have very high [quarterly earnings growth](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/669968-why-earnings-growth-matters-in-stocks.htm?nav=IBDUCorner). Investors should look for very high quarterly earnings increases for the past two quarters, say 50%, 100% or more.

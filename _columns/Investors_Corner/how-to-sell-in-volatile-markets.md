To succeed in stocks, aim to have the size of your victories be three times greater than the size of your losses. IBD calls this the 3-to-1 win-loss ratio.

Those who refuse to implement such a profit-and-loss plan can end up giving back substantial gains â€” especially when the market finally makes a sharp decline.

Experienced CAN SLIM investors know that the best way to make profits and hold onto them is to buy a stock right as it comes out of a base, hold it until the profit rises to 20% to 25%, then lock in the gain.

Do that three times a year with the same position size each time, and your total profit can reach 60% to 75%. If you sell stocks that make a 20% gain and cut your losses at 7%-8%, you can be wrong twice and right once, and still make a profit.

If a stock rises 20% in the first three weeks, you can hold it at least eight weeks in the hope it becomes a long-term winner. This is the sole exception to this sell rule.

On the other hand, a volatile market requires an adjustment. That's been the case this year and most of last year. Many growth stocks break out of bases but never make a 20% gain before the general market sputters and pulls them down.

In this kind of market, it's best to modify your profit-and-loss plan. Instead of waiting for a 20% profit that might never come, take profits at 10% to 15%. Cut losses at 3% to 5%. You still get the 3-to-1 profit-to-loss ratio to keep you in the black; you just have to take smaller profits more quickly.

**Coach** ([COH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COH)), the handbag maker, had been a big winner for more than a decade as it steadily grew sales and earnings. Even after the Great Recession hammered the stock and hurt earnings, Coach rebounded to new highs, and profit growth resumed.

Coach set up a shallow, four-month, double-bottom base in the first half of 2011. The base corrected only 16% from high to low, which is unusual for this pattern.

The stock broke out past 58.38 on April 27. The breakout was tentative; volume was only 18% above average. The next day, the stock followed through nicely as the advance came on higher volume.

But from there, it made little headway for three weeks, although it did form a bullish three-weeks-tight pattern.

Coach moved up from that point with a nice weekly 7% gain, then gave it all back as it sought support at the 50-day line. The stock had another big week, up 12%. The action was much like today, with leaders breaking out yet making little headway.

On July 8, after seven straight days of advance, the stock touched a new all-time high, then finished the day lower.

At the intraday high of 69.20 **(1)**, the stock was 18.5% above its 58.35 buy point. An investor had no way to know, but that would be Coach's high for a while.

Still, it would have been smart to take profits along that path, which led the stock higher for seven straight days, and lock in something close to a 15% profit.

Meanwhile, the market was starting to get shaky. In June, the Nasdaq had an 8% correction. In late July and early August, the indexes sold off hard . Eventually, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 declined by 20%, the minimum level for a bear market.

In August **(2)**, Coach crashed through its 10-week and 40-week moving averages and took out its 58.38 entry point. It eventually dropped 22% below the buy point.

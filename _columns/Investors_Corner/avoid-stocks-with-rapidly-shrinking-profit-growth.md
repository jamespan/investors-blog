Few companies can maintain strong profit and sales growth on an ongoing basis. All firms face weak sales in a single quarter or a difficult comparison vs. year-ago results.

When this happens, should you sell your stock? And should you refrain from a buy?

If the slowdown isn't severe and the company's fundamentals are otherwise sound, chances are the stock can withstand a temporary blip. But a pronounced drop in earnings-per-share growth for a couple quarters in a row is reason for concern.

"Even the best organizations can have a slow quarter every once in a while," William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "So before turning negative on a company's earnings, I prefer to see two consecutive quarters of material slowdown."

A drop of two-thirds or more in the growth rate from an earlier quarter should raise a red flag, such as a slowdown in a company's earnings growth to 30% from 120%, or to 10% from 50%. Such a decline warrants a closer look into what may be causing the deceleration.

If a company's profit surged from, say, 20% in one quarter to 80% the next, then slowed to 50%, it might not be a big deal. The firm saw rapid acceleration before the latest slowdown. Plus, a 50% rise in EPS is exceptional. It meets the C in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/), IBD's seven-step investment model.

But a consecutive slowdown from 50% to 20% to 5% is a red flag. It could signal an ongoing issue, or problems ahead.

EPS growth deceleration is sometimes a late sell signal. Trouble tends to show up on a stock's chart well before it does in the company's fundamentals. The chart may have triggered sell signals weeks or months ahead of the slowdown in profits.

Still, paying attention to earnings and sales growth rates is important. In some cases, the slowdown will precede a stock's topping action, particularly after the stock has made a genuinely long price run.

Where can you get quarterly earnings and sales growth rates?

Most of the mini charts that appear with IBD's Sector Leaders, IBD 50, Income Investor and other columns provide last quarter's Earnings Per Share growth rate, next quarter's estimate and the average rate for the last three quarters.

An upward arrow next to last quarter's EPS growth rate indicates acceleration, while a downward arrow points to a slowdown. If there is no arrow, earnings were flat from the prior period.

Investors.com subscribers can find this and other relevant data at IBD [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) . Enter a ticker symbol, click on the arrow, and scroll down to the "Fundamental Performance" section.

The table above shows leading stocks that showed a sharp deceleration in EPS growth in the latest quarter vs. the prior quarter. The stocks met these parameters: 80 or higher for both EPS and Composite ratings; share price of at least 15; average daily volume of 300,000 shares or more.

Also, EPS growth in the latest reported quarter had to come in at 20% or less, and at 60% or better in the previous quarter.

**Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is an interesting case. The new IPO saw EPS gains shrink to 15% in fiscal Q2 from 60% in Q1. But Wall Street looked past the slowdown; the stock broke out and rushed higher as analysts hiked their price targets. Revenue growth accelerated to 53% from 45% during the period.

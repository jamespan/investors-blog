Apple's July 30 [announcement of a 4-for-1 stock split](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-q3-2020-aapl-stock/), to take effect Aug. 31, was met with broad enthusiasm across the market. The move stirred a [reconfiguration of the Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-industrials-add-amgen-salesforce-com-honeywell-exxon-raytheon-pfizer-out/), triggering rallies in **Honeywell International** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) and **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), and preheating **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) for its 26% post-earnings spike in August.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) shares themselves rallied more than 30% from the announcement, carrying the market's weightiest stock above the \$2 trillion valuation level in the process.


A stock split is, in effect, an issuing of new shares that spreads the value of the company across the newly increased number of shares. Apple's 4-for-1 split means the new shares became one-quarter the value before the split. Companies enact such stock splits because they think that lowering the share price will encourage investors to buy more shares, and attract a new tier of price-averse investor.


But stock splits come with some serious caveats. This is particularly true of excessive splits, such as Apple's 4-for-1 decision, or [Tesla's 5-for-1 split](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-split-announced-five-for-one-stock-jumps/), also in 2020. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) shares soared following the Aug. 11 announcement. But Apple topped right when the split went into effect in early September. The stock went on to form a 17-week base that ultimately failed.

Stock Splits: Which Are Excessive?
----------------------------------


Stock splits typically come in the 2-for-1 or 3-for-2 variety. William O'Neil, [founder of Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) and author of "How to Make Money in Stocks," considers anything beyond those typical categories excessive. "Oversize splits create substantially larger supply," he explained in his bestseller. The result, he warns, "may put a company in the more lethargic, big-cap status sooner."


O'Neil also warned that the risks are greater when such splits are announced near the end of a bull market, or in the early stage of a bear market, and after a stock has run higher for a year or two. When Apple and Tesla split their share, the market was in a bull phase. It may have helped Tesla, but not Apple.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICqcom083120-300x161.jpg)In prior decades, companies have often enacted multiple stock splits over a period of two to three years. This also amounts to excessive splitting. One of the most famous examples is **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)), which executed three stock splits from late 1998 to the end of 1999. During that period the stock ran up more than 2,500%.


The third stock split, a 4-for-1 division, took place in December, 1999. The following month, Qualcomm rolled over into a 20-month decline that would reduce the stock's value by 88%.


A Seller's Perspective
----------------------


While the company aim behind a stock split is to lure more investors, O'Neil warned that the strategy can have the opposite effect. Knowledgeable pros and shrewd individual traders will take advantage of the excitement spurred by the split announcement as an opportunity to take profits, O'Neil says. "In addition, large holders who are thinking of selling might figure it will be easier to unload their 100,000 shares before a 3-for-1 split than to sell 300,000 shares afterward."


This is particularly true if it is the company's second split within a year or two.

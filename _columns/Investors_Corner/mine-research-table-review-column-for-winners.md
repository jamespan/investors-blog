**How To Profit From MAKING MONEY:** [Second In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/603354/201203061545/how-to-profit-from-ibds-making-money-.aspx)

When the Market Pulse box says the market is in an uptrend, as it does now, it's time to look for stocks to buy and scan the field for solid breakouts.

But where do you start? How do you build a watch list?

You could examine the hundreds of stocks in the daily research tables, but that could take days.

A much faster way: Head straight to the Research Table Review column, which is located most days on Page B3. It focuses only on the best stocks, so you can quickly zero in on potential winners.

The stocks discussed in the column are highlighted at the top of their respective industry sectors within the research tables.

Not every sector — in many cases not even the top-ranked ones — yields a leader that meets the strict fundamental and technical characteristics shared by winners in past bull markets.

In the Jan. 4 edition of IBD, leaders were found in sectors ranked Nos. 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 and 33. These were Internet, Banks, Business Services, Energy, Finance, Medical and Mining, respectively.

On that day, two weeks after the major indexes recorded a follow- through on Dec. 20, the Research Table Review highlighted five Sector Leaders, including **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) and **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)).

Celgene had just rallied above a 68.35 buy point. Volume was weak, but subsequent gains came in much heavier trade. The stock is now 9% above that entry point, beyond its proper buy range.

Celgene remains a Sector Leader and is now an IBD Leaderboard stock. Alexion is both a Sector Leader and an IBD 50 stock.

Many stocks stay on the leaders list for weeks or months, because it often takes a year or even longer for these winners to hit their peaks.

Don't be discouraged if you missed a breakout, or if the stock you've been watching has just moved out of its buying range. Keep watching. Many stocks will form new bases after running up 20% or more, and others will offer secondary buy points.

Those keeping an eye on Celgene know it's below a secondary 75.21 entry from a three-weeks-tight pattern. It popped past the entry in heavy trade on Feb. 15, but quickly reversed. Since then, the stock has treaded water but also found support at its 10-week line.

Keep in mind that not all stocks featured in Research Table Review will automatically rise. Rallies can dissolve into corrections, especially when the market takes a break.

For example, **Northern Oil & Gas** ([NOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOG)) was trading below a 27.80 handle buy point from a double-bottom base when it appeared in the Jan. 4 column. It topped that mark on Jan. 26, but quickly retreated. The stock has since fallen below its 10-week moving average.

So use the column to identify the proper entry, and stay disciplined.

Trading is an uncertain endeavor. Some people may struggle with putting their hard-earned money on the line in the market. It's true that all stocks are risky. But investors should summon their courage if they follow sound rules.


The chief rule for buying: Get shares in leading stocks only when they break out of bases and the market is in a confirmed uptrend. And go in with an exit strategy to [cut losses short](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/707786-follow-through-days-often-work-but-some-fail.htm) if things don't go right.


No one likes to lose money. Certainly there will be losing trades along the way. Yet this fact should not discourage you from buying breakouts, the primary setup for stocks featured in IBD.


**How To Build Confidence**


You must have good reasons to trust any trading system. Why should IBD's CAN SLIM methodology be trusted?


It shows a long history of identifying some of the best performers in the stock market's history at the start of their runs.


Huge winners such as **America Online** ([AOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOL)) and **JDS Uniphase** ([JDSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JDSU)) from the late 1990s to **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) in the 2000s could have been uncovered. Catching a monster move in a few leading stocks can change your life.


Having a good understanding of the company and its industry can help boost confidence in owning shares. Changes in technology, demographic shifts and other factors can lead to certain industries growing faster than the overall economy. This gives you a "big picture" reason to invest.


Within these fast-growing industries are companies that have cutting-edge, market-leading products and services. These leading companies tend to have solid top-line and bottom-line growth. Sometimes earnings and/or sales growth will be in the triple digits. IBD features such as The New America, Internet & Technology section, Stock Spotlight and the Sector Leaders Review (today on Page B1) will point you to such stocks.


Investors sometimes are gun-shy after a long, sharp market downtrend. Stock prices have been pummeled and investors' sentiment bruised. No one wants to stick their necks out and risk losing money. But note that eventually bad times will end.


When the market puts in a powerful [follow-through rally](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764) , signaling a new uptrend, that's your best cue to begin buying leading stocks. Some of the best stocks will break out of bases just prior to the follow-through or soon after. These tend to end up being the best performers.


Making that first buy is critical. Otherwise, you might watch the entire rally from the sidelines, frozen in fear. You don't have to plunge into the market. Just dip your ankle in, and see how things go. If you're making money, then add more positions.


On Oct. 16, 2013, the S&P 500 rallied 1.4% in higher trade, marking a follow-through day. In the week ended Oct. 25, **Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) cleared a 74.04 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Volume was weak on the Oct. 24 breakout day, but the drug stock showed strong IBD Ratings.


The stock meandered for a couple of weeks **(1)** before gapping up nearly 18% on Nov. 8 in reaction to its third-quarter results. Salix rose 23% before consolidating gains **(2)**. In many cases, at least some profits should be taken when they amount to 20% to 25%. The stock broke out again on Jan. 3 and rose 62% before pulling back.

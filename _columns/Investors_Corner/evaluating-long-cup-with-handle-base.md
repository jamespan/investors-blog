A [cup-with-handle base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/671025-cup-with-handle-base.htm?Ntt=cup-with-handle) normally takes a few months to form. Some can run much longer, but that's no reason to consider it an inferior pattern.

Although this successful basing formation can be as short as seven weeks, in some cases it takes about a year or longer to fully incubate.

This doesn't mean a long base is weaker or stronger than a shorter one. In fact, you should evaluate it the same way you would a two- or three-month base, to wit:

•There should be more up weeks than down weeks in above-average volume in the base.

•There should be a prior uptrend of at least 20% to 30% from the prior buy point to the start of the consolidation.

•The handle should be in the upper portion of the base, and no deeper than 12%. Price action within the base should be smooth.

•The stock should break out above the buy point in volume at least 40% above average.

In 2010, **Ocwen Financial** ([OCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCN)) started a cup with handle that lasted 44 weeks. A woman could conceive and give birth to a full-term baby in less time than that.

A breakdown of the base showed it had qualities of strength.

The decline from peak to low was 35% — quite deep, yet moderate for the length of the base. Weeks of above-average volume were even in terms of up vs. down weeks.

Many weeks showed "tight" price behavior, in which there was little difference from one week's close to the other. In all 44 weeks, only a few could be considered bearishly wild.

The handle formed in the upper part of the consolidation, correcting a modest 8%.

The mortgage servicing company's earnings were starting to soar. EPS jumped 29% the last quarter before the breakout. After the breakout in April 2011, Ocwen's stock rose 257% by October 2012.

Many bases formed during the 2008 bear market were long and deep. But they still worked. Why? Because as severe as those corrections were, they were still in the context of the broad market, which had plummeted 56% using the Nasdaq's 2007 peak to its 2009 bottom.

A long cup with handle should not to be confused with a [saucer base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/661850-saucer-bases-are-long-and-shallow.htm?Ntt=saucer), which is a long, flattish consolidation. (You can search for articles on the saucer base in the [IBD University](http://education.investors.com/) section of Investors.com.) It may or may not include a handle.

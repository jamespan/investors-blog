[How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/739732-how-to-trade-stocks-in-a-tough-market.htm)

  

Investing in growth stocks during a choppy market is a tricky business that's usually best avoided.

  

But if you happened to buy a stock that broke out before the market began wobbling, it pays to be defensive. While growth stocks rise much faster than their peers during a market uptrend, they can fall twice as fast if the market heads south.

  

Making a profit, even a small one, is difficult when the market toggles between confirmed uptrend and correction. That's true no matter how great the stock's fundamentals and regardless of whether it broke out of a beautifully shaped base in big volume.

  

In uncertain markets, tighten your sell rules and divorce yourself from the idea that your stocks are too good to fail.

  

The market went through choppy periods in 2011, 2012 and 2014. This year has also been choppy.

  

Let's look at how **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) behaved last year after it cleared a cup-with-handle base on July 24 while the market's uptrend was under pressure. The gap up established a buy point at 65.51, as defined by the opening price on that day. Under Armour rose even as the market bounced between "Confirmed uptrend" (as noted in the Market Pulse, today on Page B3) and "Market in correction." The stock climbed to a high of 73.42 on Sept. 8, up 12% **(1)**.

  

The stock's healthy gains in the face of the market's headwinds might have given a new investor the sense that Under Armour was invincible.

  

An experienced trader would have known to keep the impulse to get greedy in check, especially since UA's base was a riskier late-stage pattern. Such an investor may have started to sell into strength instead of waiting to see if the stock could achieve a 20% gain, which would have triggered a profit-taking rule.

  

Sure enough, UA quickly began to pull back **(2)** as the market once again came under pressure on Sept. 15.

  

On that day, the stock fell 3% in volume that was 28% above normal, briefly slicing through its 50-day moving average (please view a daily chart). The stock ended in the lower half of its intraday range and finished below the buy point.

  

For those who were still holding on, the stock's action was a sign of weakness that would have justified selling at least a portion of one's shares. In a choppy market, investors need not wait for the 8% sell rule in order to limit losses.

  

For those who chose to hang on, the roller-coaster ride continued. UA seesawed around the buy point for several weeks as the market gyrated between uptrend and correction. UA gave shareholders a couple of chances to sell, slicing through its 50-day line in heavy volume on Sept. 22 and again on Oct. 1, when the market slipped back into a correction.

  

Finally, in the week ended Oct. 17, UA sank to a low of 60, triggering the 8% sell rule along the way.

  

Investors who had bought shares much earlier in the run would have still had a big profit and could have afforded to hold on as the stock went on to form a new cup-with-handle base. But those who had arrived late would have done well to take profits or cut losses in order to protect capital and reduce the risk of further declines.

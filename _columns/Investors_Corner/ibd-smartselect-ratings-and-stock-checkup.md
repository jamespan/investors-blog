Stocks are hard to predict. The best an investor can do is look for factors that improve the probability of success. IBD's SmartSelect Ratings in the stock tables and [Stock Checkup](https://www.investors.com/new/tools.aspx) on Investors.com are two places to start an evaluation.

The ratings alone won't guarantee success. For example, a [new factor](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735738&sourceid=735749) — new products, new services or a change in industry conditions — is a key element for a winning stock. Yet there is no numerical way to judge a new factor.

So give up the notion that ratings alone can identify a sure winner in every market. Investing is seldom that simple.

Let's look at some of the best performing stocks of 2015. IBD ran a list of the top 50 gainers in the Jan. 4 Year-End Special.

For our purposes here, we've weeded out companies that had never turned an annual profit or were thinly traded.

Even among 2015's better stocks, the ratings were often imperfect. Given that 2015 was a mixed year for stocks, that's not a surprise.

Many big gainers were turnaround stories, which naturally have spotty ratings.

**Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)), a cardiac device maker, gained about 120% after bouncing off its 10-week line in January 2015. The day before the breakout, its ratings were: Composite Rating, 88; EPS, 51; RS, 97; Sales + Margins + ROE, C; Accumulation/Distribution, B.

The low EPS and SMR ratings were tied to rocky results from mid-2013 to mid-2014. (The EPS Rating is calculated over five years and SMR over three quarters.)

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) broke out in April and gained 70%. Its ratings were: Composite, 67; EPS, 46; RS, 86; SMR, B; Accumulation, C+. Netflix's earnings suffered from tough comparisons vs. the year-earlier quarters.

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) was a turnaround story. Its stock broke out several times in 2015; at each breakout, ratings rose. By the July breakout, its Composite was 72, up from 26 at the start of the year. Other ratings in July were 18 EPS; 93 RS; D in SMR; B in Accumulation.

Other top performers were **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)), **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)), **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)), **OrbitalATK** ([OA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OA)) and **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)).

None were classic [CAN SLIM stocks](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) with highly strong ratings.

The lesson: Don't expect 90-plus ratings in turnaround stocks that are fighting a difficult market.

Adjust expectations to the market's condition and to the kind of stock (CAN SLIM, turnaround, cyclical) that you're studying.

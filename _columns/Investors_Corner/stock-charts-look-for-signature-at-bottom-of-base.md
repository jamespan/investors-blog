  Stock Charts: Look For Signature At Bottom Of Base

A bullish stock chart often leaves a bold signature. Like most signatures, individual investors will find it at the bottom — in this case, the bottom of a base. This small element is sometimes overlooked — a beautiful reversal at the bottom of a base.


Small in this case doesn't mean unimportant. A reversal in fast trade (i.e., a stock that falls and then turns up to finish high in the daily or weekly range) points to institutional buyers stepping in to grab shares.


Individual investors might wonder if they shouldn't be grabbing shares on the reversal, too, rather than waiting for a base to be completed. There are two reasons an investor should not jump in early.


First, there's no way to know in real time if a stock has established a bottom. The bottom is only evident in hindsight. So, the investor who buys on the reversal could see the stock dive further before establishing a true bottom.


Second, even if the investor guesses right and is buying at the bottom, there's no guarantee that the stock will complete a base and break out.


IBD's rules aren't there to frustrate the investor who hopes to get the lowest possible price. The rules are designed to help the investor avoid low-probability buys and to enter a stock when it has its greatest chance of working.


**Precision Castparts** ([PCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCP)) began consolidating in May 2006.


The stock declined in four of the consolidation's first five weeks. Volume was above average on the decline **(1)**, which was not a good sign. This suggested that institutions were selling shares.


The next week — ending June 16, 2006 — the stock dropped 10% to as low as 49.40. The low of the drop came on Wednesday of that week. However, the stock rebounded in high volume the next two days.


On the weekly chart, the result was a bullish signature. A close came high in the week's range, volume was twice its usual pace **(2)** , and the rise came as the S&P 500 moved sideways to down.


Precision Castparts eventually formed a handle and broke out in October 2006. The buy point was 64.16.


From there, the stock rose 125% in 10 months.


The signature was not a buy point but a sign of institutional support. Alert investors look for such evidence as they wait for a stock to break out.

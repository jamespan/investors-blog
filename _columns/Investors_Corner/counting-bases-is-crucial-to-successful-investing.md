Say you're sprucing up your watch list when you come across a stock that meets your criteria and is shaping a nice-looking cup base. You pick up shares when they cross the ideal buy point in above-average volume. But wait a minute. The stock rises for a few days but then begins to stall. Then it turns tail and heads south, handing you a fat loss.

What happened? Fundamentally, there was nothing wrong with the stock. The market wasn't under pressure or in a correction. But maybe, just maybe, you forgot to check what stage base the stock had just broken out from.

Being able to spot chart patterns is key to successful investing. Just as important is the base's stage. Stocks tend to make their biggest runs as they break out from early-stage patterns â€” generally, the first two bases. True market leaders with rock-solid fundamentals can sometimes extend their gains past a third- or even fourth-stage base.

After that, a stock that has been on a tear may run out of steam. By this point, everyone in the market has caught on to the "hot" stock. As a result, up to 80% of fourth-stage bases tend to fail, according to "How to Make Money in Stocks."

So, how do you count bases?

First, be sure to count only bases that have completed their minimum length: five weeks for a flat base, and seven weeks for a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base. And even if you see multiple bases on a stock chart, you can't just count 'em all.

After a stock breaks out from a base, it must rise at least 20% from the buy point before the next pattern takes shape. Otherwise, the bases would form a base-on-base pattern and count as a single base.

It's easier to spot bases on a weekly chart. If a base undercuts the low of a prior pattern, that resets the base count. So the new base becomes first-stage.

Take a look at **Advanced Energy Industries** ([AEIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEIS)). Shares first cleared a five-week flat base in early 2012 and rose 23% before starting a new pattern in May 2012. The stock built this second-stage base over nine months, until its big-volume breakout the week ended Jan. 25, 2013.

From there, the stock rallied 37% over the next two months, then launched into a third-stage base **(1)**. It cleared a 20.10 buy point the week ended July 12. But this time, the stock rose just 14% over the next three weeks before slipping into another base **(2)**.

So the new pattern would be considered a base-on-base. Advanced Energy emerged from a 14-week cup base at 23.04 the week ended Nov. 8, 2013, and fell into yet another new pattern **(3)** after an ultrashort 15% rise. Since the advance was again less than 20%, this base would be considered part of the original third-stage base.

It cleared the last of the base-on-base pattern in mid-January, but only advanced 9% before heading south. By mid-March, the stock triggered a sell signal **(4)** as it fell more than 8% below the 26.65 entry. It then proceeded to fall below its 10-week and 40-week moving average lines.

The power conversion products maker had shown accelerating profit and sales growth while forming the third-stage base-on-base, but the stock was running out of gas.

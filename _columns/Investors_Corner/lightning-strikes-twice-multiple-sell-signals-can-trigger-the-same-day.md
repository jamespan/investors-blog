  When To Sell Growth Stocks: How More Than One Sell Signal Can Trigger The Same Day

An investor who acts upon a good sell signal affirms the thinking of baseball great Branch Rickey. The former general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers is known to have said he'd rather trade a ballplayer a year too early than a year too late.




The saying rings true in the stock market. Once a stock has topped in price after a steady run to new highs and big gains, it can go downhill fast.


No one can sell always right at the top. Yet  it's far better to exit a winning stock several points below the ultimate peak. Only price-and-volume action will alert you to a crowd of fund managers jamming the exits, sending shares in free fall.


When your stock is up a lot, it's really the time to set your brain on high alert. And more than one critical sell signal can take place quickly — even in one day. That's no time to dither.



**AMN Healthcare Services** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)), the San Diego-based nursing and physician staffing firm, enjoyed a strong run from the summer of 2014 to August of 2016.


The stock took a break after rising to as high as 37.47 on Sept. 23, 2015. Two sell-offs (to a low of 23.07 on Oct. 22, then a lower low on Feb. 8, 2016), combined with a short-term rebound to 31.70 in late December set the stage for a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). One could have bought the stock when it rose 10 cents above that middle peak of 31.70, or as it cleared a six-day handle at 33.40 on March 30, 2016, in above-average trade.


AMN rallied nicely from April to July, up 33%. Remember the rule to [begin taking profits once your gain is at 20% or 25%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/). Have a little more conviction in the stock? OK, then you can sit the run out a little longer. In this case, a little extra patience paid off.


Let's say you sold half your shares in July as AMN hit 43.42, up 30% from the 33.40 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Nice work. But keep your eye on the ball.


When To Sell Stocks: The First Sell Signal
------------------------------------------


As seen on the accompanying daily chart, AMN soon made new highs in low volume, an [early sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-why-new-highs-in-low-volume-can-halt-a-big-run/). On July 22, 2016, the stock rose to a new peak of 44.35; volume that day fell 53% below its 50-day average **(1)**. Demand for shares was cooling fast. Volume was still low three days later when AMN hit a closing high of 44.16 **(2)**.

Then the heavy selling arrived. On July 29 the stock fell 2.5% to 42.30. Volume jumped 114% above average, the biggest turnover in weeks.


The Second Sell Signal
----------------------


On Aug. 5, a day after AMN posted terrific second-quarter results (earnings per share up 61%, revenue up 35%), shares still reversed badly **(3)**. AMN hit a new high of 44.99, then fell 4% for the day in big volume. The negative action was sell signal No. 2. That same day, AMN undercut its 50-day moving average near 40.84 in big volume — sell signal No. 3.


AMN eventually bottomed out at 26, a 42% plunge, right after the U.S. elections in November 2016. The stock took roughly a year to rebound in price and build several bases.

If you seek mastery in how to trade stocks, always remember this simple yet powerful truth on Wall Street: A big winner in one bull market likely won't lead in the next.




It doesn't matter how much a stock's gone up or what industry it's in. That's why it's key to stay on top of new market leaders.


Among top leading stocks during bull markets over the past 50 years, IBD has found that once they peaked, they fell an average 72%. That's why good sell rules help you lock in profits and avoid excruciating losses when it's time to sell.


Now, here's an even scarier fact: IBD found in a 1995 study that big leaders from one bull cycle that fell 90% or more in the following bear never came back in price.


So if you stick with the old leaders, chances are high that your portfolio will struggle for a long time.


How To Trade Stocks: Lessons From The Nifty Fifty
-------------------------------------------------


Polaroid, innovator of the instant camera, was a "Nifty Fifty" stock in the 1960s. It topped in May 1972 at 149.50 a share and sank 91% to its September 1974 low. It got back up around 60 twice but gave up in 2001, when it went bankrupt.


Going back even further in time, late 1920s leader Radio Corp. of America traded near 400 in early 1929. By early 1931, RCA had plunged 98%. It struggled for decades.



Paramount Publix shot up to 150 in the fall of 1928 — and went belly up seven years later. Later reorganized as Paramount Pictures, it exists today as part of **Viacom** ([VIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIA)). But those who held Paramount Publix hoping for a recovery lost their shirts.


Remember the highfliers of the late 1990s tech rally? Of the top five stocks of 1999, Brocade Communications Systems, Commerce One and Verticalnet plunged more than 90% from their peak to trough. PurchasePro.com filed for bankruptcy.


GE Stock: A Crash After The Peak, And A Slow Burn
-------------------------------------------------


It's tough to forget energy giant Enron — a big, nontech leader in the '90s. In August 2000, the energy and commodities trading firm ran up to as high as 90.75. Yet by November 2001, mired in a big accounting scandal, it fell to as low as 25 cents. In early 2002 the firm went under. But early in its decline, its chart gave multiple sell signals.



There are a few exceptions like **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), which traded near 400 in 1929 and fell to below 10 in 1932, a 98% decline. Still, it took many years for investors to recoup their losses.


Today, GE shares trade 38% below a 52-week high of 13.78 and nearly 75% below a 2016 peak of 33.

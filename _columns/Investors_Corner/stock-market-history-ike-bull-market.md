The bull market in President Eisenhower's first term seldom gets the attention it deserves in stock market history.


Yet, this unique uptrend offers a valuable lesson.




A smooth run-up lets investors sit tight. A choppy advance makes the overall gain less useful.


This is why IBD insists that nothing matters more to the stock market than the market itself. The individual investor's success in the stock market is due more to the market — the ["M" in CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764) — than due to the investor's individual brilliance.


Humility, though, goes against human nature.


The human ego doesn't like to share credit. If an individual investor has a great run in a stock, he or she wants to believe it's because of personal brilliance. But the humble investor realizes that the best markets make everybody look smarter than they truly are.


Sluggish In 1953
----------------


In the first nine months of 1953, the market wasn't making too many people feel like geniuses. From a high on Jan. 5, 1953, to a mid-September low, the Dow Jones industrial average sank 13.8%.


Action was choppy and downtrending. This meant that those who bought on the dips, bought into more trouble.


Change Was Coming
-----------------


The back story, though, had been changing for years.


The U.S. government had implemented price controls during World War II. Cynics say that once government grabs power, it rarely gives it up.


For a while, this was true. President Truman micromanaged price controls after the war. He lifted price controls on some items and kept them on others.


Free Market Unleashed
---------------------


Eisenhower, though, was bolder. On March 17, 1953, he put an end to all price controls. The free market was back. Optimism rose.


In the private sector, people bought houses, bought cars on credit and had babies. And the stock market was about to take off.


Stock Market History
--------------------


On Sept. 22, 1953, the Dow delivered a Day 6 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), closing the session at 261.28 and confirming an uptrend was underway.


Something amazing followed. The Dow abandoned its choppy ways and rose smoothly*for two years*.


The overall gain was 93%. Even more impressive, the biggest pullback during the two-year run was 8%during mid-March of 1955. Most of the pullbacks were in the 3% to 5% range.


How did the run end?


On Saturday, Sept. 24, 1955, Eisenhower had a heart attack. The following Monday, the Dow plunged almost 9% before cutting the loss to 6.5%. From there, the market turned choppy, even though Eisenhower recovered.

  Learning To Sell Short Can Help You Spot Long Exits

Finding and buying leading stocks are what IBD discusses the majority of the time. Yet investors can also make money selling stocks short.


Granted, shorting is a whole different animal with its own set of [rules](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm). But you can reap two benefits. Learning to short will help you take advantage of down markets. It will also help you more keenly recognize correct exit points in your long trades.


When you sell a stock short, you're selling something that you don't already own in hopes that the price will go down. That way, you can buy it back later at a lower price and pocket the difference.


In a short sale, shares are borrowed from a broker to sell short. When you cover the position, you buy back the shares and, in effect, return them to the broker.


Just as buying should only be done in an up market, investors should only sell short in a bear market.


"Bear markets happen about once every three years," noted IBD founder and chairman William J. O'Neil in [The Short Selling Home Study course](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/short-selling/?src=APA1BQ8). "When they occur, the decline takes place much faster than the previous rise."


Shorting isn't for beginning investors. But with time, any disciplined trader can learn to short in order to take advantage of opportunities on the downside. While leading stocks can have long, stellar runs, they eventually do break down.


**Titanium Metals** ([TIE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIE)) was a monster winner from late 2004 to May 2006. But then the stock plunged from an all-time high of 47.63 to 4.04 by 2009. **Valero Energy** ([VLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLO)), another former leader, set off a short sale during the 2007-to-2009 bear market and fell more than 80%.


Timing is crucial in short-selling. Investors should always consult a chart to see if a stock is in position to be shorted. While many investors would like to have shorted at the very top, shorting opportunities typically don't present themselves until the stock has already broken down.


Investors can use a stock's failed late-stage base breakout to enter the short side. Those who get caught in the failed breakout from a late-stage pattern can use this action to reverse their position.


When checking out a stock's price action, what may appear to be two bumps with a larger bump in the middle may actually be a head-and-shoulders formation. This is another key short-sale pattern and it takes months to develop.


The correct entry arrives when the stock makes a last rebound attempt above the 50-day moving average and fails, dropping below the line in heavy trading.


On Sept. 20, 1993, **International Game Technology** ([IGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGT)) cleared a 39.35 buy point in a late-stage cup with handle. The stock rose 5% by Sept. 29 before fizzling **(1)**.


IGT triggered the 8% sell rule Oct. 20 **(2)**. This failed breakout not only marked a sell signal for investors that bought at 39.35, but it was also a short-sale signal. Shares slumped more than 50% by June 1994.

You'll never know for sure if a stock is going to be a huge winner if you sell it too soon. So if the stock you just bought makes a big jump right away, resist the urge to take the money and run.

Watching a stock go up after you sell it can be truly frustrating. That's where the eight-week rule comes in. The rule states that if a stock breaks out from a proper base and gains 20% or more in three weeks or less, you should hold it for at least eight weeks.

It's normal for a stock to pull back after breaking out, so don't panic unless the stock starts to give back the bulk of its gains. Only then should you sell. You never should turn a good profit into a loss.

Stocks that gain 20% or more soon after the breakout are showing you unusual power. These have the potential of doubling, tripling or more.

The eight-week rule is designed to help you avoid the heartache of missing out on what could be a monster winner. Stocks that surge hundreds of percentage points will seldom do so in a short period of time. Big gains need time to brew.

In "How To Make Money In Stocks," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote, "Your objective is not just to be right but to make big money when you are right."

If you bought a stock with great earnings and sales growth, healthy margins and institutional sponsorship as it just cleared a base, you have to give it time to do its thing. In investing, patience is a virtue.

Avoid thinking too much once you're in the stock. You don't have to watch every tick. Doing so can cause you to get shaken out. But be aware of signs of weak action and act if they appear.

**Jinko Solar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) cleared an 11.15 buy point from a cup-with-handle base in the week ended July 9, 2010 **1**. The pattern was an IPO base, as the Chinese low-cost maker of solar cells and wafers came public at 11 a share just two months before that. In the same week of the breakout, the NYSE composite and the S&P 500 followed through.

The stock gained 43% in just three weeks. That big gain over a short period of time meant that Jinko Solar had the potential to be a huge winner. It sure did. With the market rising fast after a fresh Sept. 1 follow-through in the market, Jinko shot up more than 200% before retreating to its 10-week line in October **2**.

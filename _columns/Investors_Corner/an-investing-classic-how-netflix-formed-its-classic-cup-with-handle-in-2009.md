  An Investing Classic: How Netflix Formed Its Cup With Handle In 2009

Every field has its mainstays. College football has the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Clemson Tigers lately, while opera has "La Boheme."


In the field of finding leading stocks before they produce a masterpiece of big gains, one mainstay is the cup-with-handle base.


If you don't know this chart pattern, then you probably don't know the right time to buy a great stock. And you're missing out on some great buy opportunities.


A cup typically begins to take shape during a mild or intermediate decline in the general market.


As a cup develops for a growth stock, it's normal for shares to fall 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times more than the major indexes. The drop from the cup's top to its bottom usually ranges from 12% to 30%.


![ic-chart-011817](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IC-011817-923x1024.png)The pattern should have a rounded U-shape rather than a V-shape, says William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "The 'U' area is important because it scares out or wears out the remaining weak holders and takes other speculators' attention away from the stock," O'Neil wrote.


He also notes that before the pattern starts to form, the stock should have been in a clear prior uptrend of at least 30% in price.


The pattern's handle starts to develop after the stock has spent time working on the right side of its cup. The handle area is characterized by a downward price drift, or what's called a "shakeout," rather than upward-drifting action. You want to see volume dry up as the handle forms.


You also want the correction in the handle to be no more than 12% to 15%. In a major bear market, the decline might be larger and the handle can still work. And it should take shape in the upper half of the base, ideally with the handle's peak within 15% of the cup's peak.


How long should the handle be? At least a week. Overall, the length for the entire cup-with-handle base ranges from at least seven weeks to typically no more than 65 weeks.


Highflier **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) broke out of an excellent cup-with-handle base in 2009. The DVD-rental-by-mail pioneer began to form a cup in April that year, after hitting an all-time high of 50.24 **(1)**.


Netflix's three-week handle started to take shape in September 2009. The high in the handle was at 48.20 **(2)**. That's easily within 15% of the 50.24 peak for the cup's left side.


Turnover was below average as the handle developed, as you would prefer to see **(3)**.


Volume picked up as the stock cleared its handle buy point of 48.30 **(4)**. You get that buy point by adding a dime to the 48.20 peak in the handle.


Another positive sign was that trade kicked in even more in the week after the breakout, as the stock reached another new high **(5)**.


So when might you have sold this stock? It's reasonable to have bailed out in the week ended Nov. 13, 2009 **(6)**. At that point, Netflix had advanced more than 20% from its 48.30 buy point, and one of IBD's sell strategies is to lock in your profits after a gain of 20%.


If you had sold your shares then, you wouldn't have had to sweat as Netflix corrected from mid-November through late January to as low as 48.52.


But even with that decline, the stock didn't fall below its 48.30 trigger. Most big winners don't drop below a proper buy point as they make their big advances.


Netflix went on to climb as high as 174.40 by Sept. 30, 2010. That's a gain of 261% from its cup-with-handle buy point.

Before you learn something new, you first must answer a question: How much time am I willing to put into the effort?

Investing is like any other discipline, from playing the saxophone to learning martial arts. Commitment leads to frequent practice and eventually mastery.

Yet, many people aren't interested in mastery. They just want to improve their investment skills enough to make a little money and protect what they have. This is fine, as long as expectations are adjusted downward.

What does IBD have to offer to the investor who has neither the time nor the interest to become an accomplished investor?

Two paths are possible.

The first is Leaderboard's [ETF Market Strategy](https://www.investors.com/offer/splash.aspx?id=etfstrategy).

This subscription service will tell you when to be 100% invested, 50% invested and 0% invested in stocks. Investors use an index exchange-traded fund â€” such as **PowerShares QQQ** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)), which is built around the index of the 100 largest Nasdaq nonfinancial stocks.

The ETF Strategy takes maybe five minutes a day: Go to the Leaderboard section of Investors.com or the daily update published in the ETF section of IBD, read the ETF commentary, note the recommended exposure level and make any necessary changes.

IBD research shows this method will outperform the major indexes in most markets. However, gains often will be less than a proper strategy built around top-rated individual stocks.

The second way is to use the [free online program at IBD University](http://education.investors.com/onlinecourses.aspx?nav=secondIBDUOnlineCourses) to learn how to gauge the market and buy, hold and sell stocks.

The online courses involve 22 lessons. Yes, that requires a lot more time than the ETF Market Strategy. But you can take it in a slow, one-at-a-time fashion.

As you learn the IBD way, however, it's not a good idea to risk too much money. Partial knowledge can lead to mistakes. So if you are just starting out, set aside a small amount as tuition money.

How long does it take to learn? The more time you spend, the more you learn.

If you are new to investing, you might learn more quickly than experienced investors who must first unlearn what they "know."

Rooting out bad ideas can be a challenge.

The IBD University can be found on the main navigation bar near the top of most pages at Investors.com.

Let volume be your guide. That's been a constant refrain in IBD's articles for years and years.


Here's the idea behind it: Big volume indicates anxious buying or selling by institutions or other big investors. It's these heavyweights who have the power to really move a stock to new heights or send it tumbling.


But what exactly does it mean to have big volume? It refers to many more shares changing hands than normal.


Look at the average daily volume for the stock that you're studying, then see if the current session's turnover is much higher than average. To get the average level, IBD and its sister company MarketSmith generally use a 50-day moving average.


On the breakout, you prefer to see trade that's at least 40% above the average over the past 50 days. On a weekly basis, you would like to see higher turnover for the breakout week than during the prior week.


William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has noted that many individual investors are leery of buying a stock that's breaking out.


"In almost all cases, it's professional institutional buying that causes the big, above-average volume increases in the better-priced, better-quality growth-oriented stocks at pivot breakouts," he wrote in his best-seller "How to Make Money in Stocks."


He also wrote: "A full 95% of the general public is usually afraid to buy at such points because it's scary and it seems risky and rather absurd to buy stocks at their highest prices. Your objective isn't to buy at the cheapest price or near the low, but to begin buying at exactly the right time, when your chances for success are greatest."


**Dollar Tree**'s ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) action in February 2010 provided a good example of massive turnover during a breakout. The discount retailer cleared a long flat base in the week ended Feb. 26. **1** On a daily chart, volume was 448% more than its 50-day average of 1.2 million shares. It drew its biggest weekly volume in about 10 months as it surged. **2**


You also prefer to see strong trade when a stock hits a new 52-week peak. That shows that some big investors haven't lost their appetite for the stock even as it reaches new high ground. At the same time, don't expect to see big turnover with every new high. That just doesn't happen.

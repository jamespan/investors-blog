  Why A Flawed Double-Bottom Base Is A Road To Ruin

Next to cups with handles, double bottoms are among the most common and important base patterns. Lots of money has been made by astute traders who buy breakouts from these bases.


Can you spot a bad double bottom from a good one that you should buy?


The double bottom looks like the letter W. The stock makes two declines with a brief advance in the middle. It should have the same dimensions as other bases that are usually created in market downturns. It should be at least seven weeks long and correct no more than 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the correction in the general market.


Know that the second leg down should undercut the low of the first leg. And the middle advance's high point should be at least midway up the base.


The operative phrase in this column's description of double bottoms is that the base is well-formed. So when considering buying a stock breaking out of a double bottom — or any base for that matter — look for flaws.


Here are some things that can go wrong in a double bottom:


•The second leg didn't undercut the first. This is necessary to create one last shakeout of weak holders.


• It's too deep.


• It's a triple bottom. Three trips down to the bottom or more are too many. They tend to fail with regularity.


• The middle advance doesn't make it to the upper half of the pattern.


• It's excessively wide and loose. This applies to other bases.


Experienced chart readers know that tightly constructed patterns are best. They indicate solid institutional support for a stock. The trading desks of the big mutual fund and pension companies won't let the price drop because they are always looking to add to favored positions.


Take the example of **Affiliated Computer Services** ([ACS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACS)) in 2002 and 2003. A major problem with this double bottom is that it showed too many weeks with wide spreads.


The week ended Oct. 11, 2002, 1 was a bullish reversal off the bottom, normally a good sign. But the weekly range was 22% from low to high. If that was the only week that did that, it might be OK. But it wasn't.


The week ended July 26, 2002, 2 showed an 18.5% price spread, and the week ended Nov. 15 was 28% 3. Affiliated never made it to a new high, instead rolling over just as a new bull market was beginning.

The coronavirus stock market crash in late February and March of 2020 paved the way for a new significant uptrend, resulting in a number of big price gains among top growth stocks. Top chip stock surged past a [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) at the start of the new stock market uptrend, leading to a huge gain in about four months.




The double-bottom base is one of the [bullish patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) commonly formed by top stocks before they make outstanding runs. Found by using stock charts, a double bottom is among the chart patterns like the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) and [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) that investors should be in the hunt for.


A double bottom can be identified by its W-shaped formation. In a proper double bottom, the low of the second bottom will undercut the low of the first, shaking out the weaker investors. A double bottom's [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is the price at the middle peak of the pattern.

Double-bottom bases form over a minimum of seven weeks. Other requirements include a prior uptrend in the stock's price. The decline in the entire base is typically 20% to 30%. However, severe bear markets — like the coronavirus stock market crash — [can lead to deeper](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) double bottoms.


Sometimes you'll see a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) form on the double bottom. It can present an additional buy point.


Inphi's Double Bottom Base
--------------------------



During the coronavirus bear market, the Nasdaq fell as much as 33% from its 52-week high. During that same time period, Inphi corrected 40% as it formed an eight-week double-bottom base, according to [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) chart analysis. Growth stocks will typically correct at least two times the general market, so a 40% decline was nothing unusual.


During the first leg down, the stock price bottomed at 69.07 on Feb. 28, 2020 **(1).** After a brief rebound, the stock plunged back through its long-term 200-day moving average, eventually bottoming out at 55.72 on March 23 **(2)**. Remember, the second low needs to undercut the first low to create a proper double bottom.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICroi081020-1024x549.jpg)On April 6, Inphi was one of the first stocks to break out past a new buy point, following the April 2 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-coronavirus-stock-market-rally-breakouts-amazon-stock-netflix-stock/). On the [breakout day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), Inphi stock soared past an 84.47 buy point **(3)**, rising more than 9% and ending the session in a buy zone that topped out at 88.80. A problem was a lack of huge volume on the breakout; heavy volume didn't appear until days later.


But a [surging relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) **(4)** offered a sign of tremendous strength. Over the next few sessions, shares quickly became extended.


After two successful tests of the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) support level, Inphi stock rallied as much as 67.9% from the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) through Aug. 4 in the wake of the [company's strong earnings results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/inphi-earnings-q2-2020-iphi-stock/).


The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted 95 cents a share on sales of \$175.3 million in the June 2020-ended quarter. Inphi was acquired by **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) in April 2021.

The rules regarding the shapes of bullish chart patterns are strict.


A [solid cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) must take a minimum seven weeks or more to form. A flat base needs at least five weeks.


Seven weeks for a cup? What's wrong with four or five?  The answer: time.


Before a true market leader stages a breakout and runs to new highs, it needs time to weather market pullbacks and profit-taking by some shareholders. The stock needs time to bottom out and regain upward price momentum before getting in the right position to rally to new highs.


In its research of major market winners over the decades, IBD has discovered that many of the best stocks built cup patterns that took months or even more than a year to form. So, what if you find a cup pattern that's only three, four or five weeks in length? You might have just spotted a subtle topping pattern.

**IBD'S TAKE**: *There are seven common patterns that the best growth companies create in the stock market before they break out and go to new highs. And when a stock is at new highs, all the long-holders are happy.

This sell signal, called "sharp pullback and recovery to new highs" and first introduced at IBD's Chart School workshops (now featured as a [home study course](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD_New_Store_LP&src=APA1BQ) available via Investors.com), constitutes one of 11 offense-related sell signals that help you nail profits near the top, even while the stock is rising.


There are several varieties of this pattern. After a long run-up, a stock might fall hard for two straight weeks, then rush higher the next two weeks to new highs before eventually peaking.


In some cases, it might be three weeks down, three weeks up. Or simply one big weekly drop and two big weeks up.  No matter what the combination, you're trying to spot excessively volatile action.


A sharp pullback, followed by a fast surge to new high ground, suggests that some late fund managers and individual investors are desperately buying shares and throwing caution to the wind. While it's nice to see a stock shoot quickly back to new highs, the resulting V-shaped base pattern tends to bear a higher risk of failure.

Let's say you're viewing a 13-week cup base with a handle that formed near the cup's high and slants gently lower. The handle action indicates that the few remaining frustrated shareholders who bought at high prices have finally exited the stock. When an investor with deep pockets suddenly starts to buy shares heavily, the spike in demand sends the price screaming higher.


**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) broke out of a long saucerlike base with a 125.77 buy point in heavy volume in April of 2007 **(1)**. The market was in a decent uptrend at the time.


In July that year, an excellent Q2 report by the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based firm sent the stock catapulting 34% to new highs in monstrous volume **(2)**. At the time, earnings per share rocketed 80% above year-ago levels as sales climbed 61%. The after-tax margin was 21.9%.


The stock offered several chances to add shares, such as mild pullbacks to the 10-week moving average in May and June **(3)**, before its javelin-like spike.


From late June to late October, Intuitive rose in 15 of 17 weeks, gaining 139%. But after a climactic 22% jump in the week ended Oct. 27, Intuitive carved a three-weeks-down, three-weeks-up base **(4)**.


Although it posted a new high of 359.59 **(5)**, Intuitive quickly reversed and fell fast. Over the next seven months, the stock formed a jagged cup base that featured some weeks of accumulation, but the shape was not smooth.


By March 2, 2009, Intuitive shares plummeted to 84.86, 76% below the 359.59 peak.

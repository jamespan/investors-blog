Leading stocks that break out of bases are the primary targets of [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/) investors.

Yet while some breakout stocks go on to big gains, others may fizzle. That's why investors should always cut losses at 7% or 8%, without question. But sometimes they should be cut even earlier.

This is especially the case when there's poor action immediately after a breakout.

"The average of all your losses should be less, perhaps 5% or 6%, if you're strictly disciplined and fast on your feet," wrote IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil in the investment classic "How To Make Money In Stocks." "If you can keep the average of all your mistakes and losses to 5% or 6%, you'll be like the football team on which opponents can never move the ball."

A proper breakout marks a critical point for a stock: It just cleared resistance in volume that's at least 40% above average. This action shows an influx of buyers. In many cases, strength begets strength, so one would expect more good things to come.

Still, watch for these signs to help you decide whether to dump a stock before it hands you a loss of 7% or 8%.

• **Weak volume on breakout.** The level of volume is key when a stock takes out a buy point. Big turnover signals authentic institutional demand. It's the continuous buying from mutual funds and hedge funds that sends a high-quality stock significantly higher. But low volume on the breakout and the days that follow shows a lack of conviction from professional buyers.

• **Closing sharply below the buy point.** Intraday strength is a good thing to see, but what's also important is that a stock finishes strong on its breakout day. Closing well below the buy point after a big gain in heavy trade usually signals poor demand.

• **General market conditions.** Investors can pick a stock with triple-digit growth rates that's just broken out from a textbook cup with handle in more than twice its average trade. But the stock may have trouble making progress if the market is under pressure or in a correction. Most stocks trade the direction of the general market.

• **Other weak action.** Pay attention to other things that take place after a leader stock breaks out. They include heavy volume on down days and light trade on up days. Also watch for breaks of support levels such as the 50-day moving average. A stock that shoots up from the bottom of the base may look like strong action. But it's coming up too far too fast, which is a flaw.

**Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) cleared a 172.60 buy point from a long cup-with-handle base July 22 in volume 50% above average **(1)**. Despite a good start, that one-day show of strength was all it could muster. The market's uptrend was under pressure at that time. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 would soon pull back 4%.

The stock fell nearly 6% intraday July 24 despite better-than-expected earnings. Alexion finished the session with a 3% loss despite finding support at its 50-day moving average **(2)** . Alexion was little changed the next day. Then it breached support at the 50-day line July 28 in heavy trading **(3)**.

With the weak initial action, breach of support and a weak market, investors don't have to wait for a 7% or 8% loss before selling. Alexion fell 8% below the 172.60 trigger on July 31 4, then slumped a bit more.

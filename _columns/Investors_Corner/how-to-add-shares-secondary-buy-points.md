IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil likes to credit the writings of stock market legend Jesse Livermore for teaching him this lesson: Your objective in the market is not simply to be right, but to make big money when you're right.

  

That comes down to having a big position in a winning stock. Only a few of the stocks you buy will be big winners that double, triple or more. So you want to be able to recognize them quickly and have the conviction to stick with them.

  

One way to build a big position is by adding a tapering number of shares as the stock moves up. Adding shares without regard to the stock's chart is dangerous as it moves above a base, so look for proper secondary buy points. Aim at pullbacks right to or very near the 50-day or 10-week moving average. Also keep an eye out for the [3-weeks-tight pattern](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/704144-understanding-the-three-weeks-tight-pattern.htm).

  

In a few cases, a secondary buy point can be used to start a new position. But in most cases you want to add no more than 5% or, at the very most, 10% to your original position. You need to be very aware of your average purchase price. Raise it too high and a hard-earned gain can be erased by a normal correction. The follow-on buys that you make along with your initial core position can quickly make for a really big position.

  

Some institutional investors look for pullbacks to or near the 50-day or 10-week line to add to their positions, so that's why it works as a support line. The best pullbacks are in light volume. Then strong volume comes in on the bounce off the line.

  

The first two touches off the line are usually safe places to add shares. After that, it becomes dangerous.

  

A 3-weeks-tight pattern occurs soon after a stock's breakout. In the pattern's second and third weeks, the stock's closing price is no more than 1% to 1.5% away from the prior week in price. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the pattern.

  

Three-weeks-tight patterns work because after a stock's big advance, there are no anxious sellers. Institutional investors are holding their shares firmly, prepared to support the stock.

  

**Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) markets personal care and nutritional products using a direct-selling model. During a market rally in the second half of 2013, it was gaining a foothold in the Chinese market. Earnings and sales were growing fast.

  

It formed a long, deep base for more than a year before tightening into a handle in late spring and early summer. It broke out July 5. Although volume was light at first, the stock gapped up and exploded for a 19% gain on July 10 after an earnings report. The gain of 20% or more in three weeks or less marked the stock as a potential winner that should be held for a long-term gain. So an investor who bought right had a comfortable profit and should have been looking for secondary buy points.

  

The stock made its first bounce nearly off its 10-week moving average during the week ended Sept. 6 **(1)**. Nu Skin made its second test of the 10-week line during the week ended Oct. 11 **(2)**, another valid time to add shares. Holders enjoyed an advance of as much as 31% two weeks later.

  

In January 2014, the company got in trouble with regulators and the stock dropped. A complete exit on Jan. 15 would have preserved profits in every share bought.

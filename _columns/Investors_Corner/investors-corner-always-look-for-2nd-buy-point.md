The second time around may be the charm; or sometimes it's the third.

The point is that you need not totally give up on a stock even after you've been stopped out with an 8% loss. The decline may bring an opportunity to start a new base.

Or it may move a lot faster than that. The stock could turn around and take off from the very pattern that attracted you to it in the first place. You just need to be ready to move fast.

Look at **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)), which makes and retails its own unique shearing-lined shoes and athletic sandals, including its famous Ugg line.

The highly rated stock built a tight consolidation in the two months through Christmas 2009 **1**.

You might think there's a base in there, but there really isn't. As a test from the 10-week moving average, Deckers provided you a perfectly valid entry.

Deckers pushed out from this consolidation, but it only rose 11% before fizzling **2**.

The stock then logged four straight weeks of declines **3**. The 10-week line was breached, and the stock ended up just pennies shy of an 8% loss from the high of that prior consolidation.

If you had bought into that entry, you would almost surely have been stopped out.

This is where it pays to not just walk away in disgust. The four-week slide ended. Deckers quickly regained its 10-week moving average and, from there, staged a lovely rebound **4**.

If you had gotten stopped out during that four-week decline, where and how could you have gotten back in?

As soon as you saw the stock regain its 10-week line, you should have been on the alert.

You could have waited for Deckers to take out its recent high, 113.10. But in fact you had all that space between the 10-week line (100.59 in the week ended Feb. 12) and that recent high to jump back in.

In this case, tenacity would have paid off well. Deckers went on to climb to 291, which includes a 3-for-1 split last July.

The truth is that a great stock will almost always give you more than one chance to jump in. If you stay alert and don't lose patience, you will see your chance.

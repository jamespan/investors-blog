_Ninth In A Series_

Jesuit priest and spiritual guide Anthony de Mello used to say that unhappiness has only one cause: "The false beliefs you have in your head, beliefs so widespread, so commonly held, that it never occurs to you to question them."

Unhappy investments are often linked to false beliefs as well. And the only way you can identify them is to study past trades. Reviews should include winners as well as losers. Don't assume that a profit means you made no mistakes.

Suppose you buy a stock for a faulty reason, but the stock gallops ahead for a totally unexpected reason. If you don't study the trade, you might never identify the real reason you profited.

And if you don't identify the mistake that you got away with, your next trade might suffer.

Here's one approach to studying past trades:

• **Do the groundwork for a post-trade review before you buy the stock.** Print a copy of the chart. Mark the ideal buy point and the number of shares you want to buy.

Note the stock's average daily volume. Then jot down data related to the stock. The data probably should include elements such as ratings on earnings, sales, return on equity, pretax margin, the new factor if any, industry group and sector strength, institutional sponsorship and the market.

The market's health could be the key element. You want to buy the best stocks only at the best time.

• **Don't forget to establish and record your exit strategy.** On the chart, jot down the specific price range that represents a 20% to 25% gain in the stock. In many cases, this is a good place to take profits. However, you'll also want to write down the three-weeks out date. If the stock gains 20% in the first two or three weeks after a breakout, then you should hold the stock for eight weeks. Quick gains are often the sign of a truly big winner.

• **Study the base and mark the weeks of accumulation vs. weeks of distribution.** Note if trade is wide and loose (a sign of weakness) or tight (support).

If the stock sketches a handle, make sure it is at least five days long and that the lows are not rising (known as wedging). Volume should be thin in the handle.

There's a benefit to doing this spadework before you buy. Occasionally, you'll discover that the stock or the general market doesn't meet your standards for a buy.

• **Write down the chief reason you are buying the stock.** If you find this difficult to do, then it's probably a sign that you haven't sufficiently researched the stock.

• **After you sell the stock, get everything together for the review.** This shouldn't be hard if you did the preliminary work described above. One way to look at a past trade is to evaluate the stock's performance the same way you would judge a worker you hired. Did this trade work out better or worse than you expected? Was the outperformance or underperformance of the stock a reflection of the general market, or is there something you missed in your original analysis? Write down the verdict.

• **Save your post-trade notes.** This will let you to take your analysis to the next level. When you have collected a number of post-trade charts and notes, study them to detect patterns. Is there an error you're prone to? Fashion a personal rule that will snuff it out.

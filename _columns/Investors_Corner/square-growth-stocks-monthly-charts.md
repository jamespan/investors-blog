You are a savvy picker of growth stocks. Why? You use two sets of charts: daily and weekly. But would you get even savvier by using monthly charts too? Definitely.

As the [Investor's Corner column](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/) has taught for nearly two decades, the daily and weekly charts for any highly rated stock give unbiased information that helps investors make the best decision on whether to buy a stock or not, how to [pinpoint the right time to buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), and [when to sell and lock in precious gains](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/). So how does the monthly chart fit in this picture?

A good monthly chart shows the highest price, lowest price and close for each trading month. It can offer fresh insights on the ever-changing balance between supply and demand. When a good stock is on a roll, you're going to see sharp monthly gains, often in big turnover. A true market leader may rise for many months in a row.

And when it finally drops for the month, the declines will be inferior in size. Volume should decline on those monthly pullbacks. Are you seeing turnover fall below average? Extra good.

They help you [count bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/). Counting bases gives you a good sense of the history of the stock's overall advance. Does the stock break out, run sharply up, pull back lightly, form a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), then break out again? If yes, you may have more conviction to hold for a truly impressive gain.

The [higher the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/), the more risk a top gun will soon hit a ceiling and roll over. The best stocks rally out of third-, fourth- and, in rare cases, fifth-stage bases. (_Go to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com) and examine the run by **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) from January 2009 to July 2011, and since its booming breakout in the week ended Oct. 21, 2016_).

In February 2017, **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) leapt out of a [deep cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) that peaked at 15.91 and bottomed out at 8.42. Such a 47% drop exceeds the maximum 33% to 35% threshold. Soon afterward, the payment transaction tech firm and financial services innovator formed an [excellent six-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). That base showed a very mild decline of 10.7% — perfect. You can even see that base on the monthly chart **(1)**.

After a late April breakout, Square soared. It rose four months in a row, up 52%. Do you see the small monthly loss of 0.9% in August 2017 that followed **(2)**? Volume was below average. It fell fractionally vs. the prior month.

That monthly chart action turned out to be a new base on the weekly chart, a [seven-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/). It also fit the dimensions of a shallow cup. Breakout again? Yes.

Since late 2017, the stock has shown a little more rocky action. Yet new bases clearly formed, even on the monthly chart **(3)**.

Meanwhile, Square has refused to undercut its 10-month moving average, as seen in the line drawn in red on the accompanying tall monthly chart above. Since one month is roughly equivalent to 20 trading days, think of the 10-month moving average as a proxy for the 200-day moving average on the daily chart.

Institutions applaud the San Francisco-based company's strategy of building fantastic new products and services to help small and medium firms grow and get more business.

Big fundamentals have driven the advance. Sales have soared from \$203 million in 2012 to \$2.2 billion last year.

Is the company profitable, too? Yes. Square earned 4 cents a share in 2016 and is expected to earn 45 cents this year, up 67%.

The Street sees 2019 profits rising 73% to 78 cents a share.

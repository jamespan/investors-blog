  Investing 101: Opinions Don't Mean Much In Stock Market

It's easy to develop opinions quickly about the stock market, but opinion doesn't often jibe with reality.

  

Interest rates, for example, often fuel bullish or bearish sentiment. When interest rates rise, it can curb consumer and business spending and have an adverse effect on the stock market. Conversely, when interest rates are falling, consumers and businesses often increase spending, which fuels the economy and stock market gains.

  

A constant barrage of negative headlines often can cause investors to opine bearishly on the stock market, but the market often does what's least expected when headlines are the most dire.

  

In March 2003, negative headline flow was rampant when the U.S. invaded Iraq. But stocks put in a bottom that month. The Nasdaq followed through with conviction on March 17, confirming a new uptrend, and a new bull market was born.

  

The same thing happened in Sept. 1, 2010, when the Nasdaq confirmed a new uptrend. At the time, economic headlines weren't all that rosy as the U.S. economy was trying to climb out of a recession while the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index was at a 22-year low.

  

Investors can be opinionated about individual stocks too.

  

While it's generally a good idea to short stocks with bad qualities like deteriorating fundamentals and shrinking mutual fund ownership, some form opinions about a stock and do the opposite by shorting stocks with positive traits.

  

The shorts have been wrong about **Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) for some time now.

  

In mid-January 2014, short interest totaled 37.5 million shares, according to Nasdaq.com. Based on its average daily trading volume at the time of 3.5 million shares, that gave it a high days-to-cover ratio of just over 9. But on Feb. 6, shares gapped up 26% after **Coca-Cola** ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)) acquired a 10% stake in Keurig for \$1.25 billion.

  

In May, Coke increased its stake to 16%. In August, shares gapped up again after Keurig inked a deal with **Kraft** ([KRFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRFT)) to make Kraft-branded coffee pods. By that time, short interest had fallen to 9.9 million shares, but its days-to-cover ratio was still elevated at around 5.5.

  

Meanwhile, a high price-to-earnings ratio might cause some to say, "This stock can't go any higher, it's already too expensive." Or they might say: "This stock can't go any lower. All the bad news is already priced in."

  

Just before the Nasdaq's follow-through day in September 2010, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) cleared a double-bottom base in mid-August. Volume was robust, a good sign. At the time of the breakout, its price-to-earnings ratio was 50. And yet the stock more than doubled over the next 11 months or so.

  

Some investors like to talk negatively about a stock just because it has a premium valuation. Netflix had one at the breakout, but it was warranted due to explosive growth. Consider: In the first three quarters of 2011, quarterly earnings growth averaged 70% while sales growth averaged 48%. Full-year profit in 2011 rose 41% from 2010. Sales increased 48%.

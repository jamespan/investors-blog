The next several Investor's Corner columns will suggest ways to boost your stock portfolio return, immediately and in the long run.

  

Suggestion No. 1: Invest only in truly innovative companies.

  

Innovative, fast-growing and dynamic companies are often the most compelling growth stocks. Quite naturally, these companies also tend to show the most rapid growth in earnings and sales in the market.

  

Although there is a phenomenal amount of innovation occurring right now in the high-tech field, don't fall into the trap of thinking innovation is limited only to technology companies.

  

Among the market's most innovative headliners, automaker **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) easily holds its own beside names like **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) and **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)).

  

Not so many years ago, groundbreaking tech name **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) went public shortly ahead of another innovative concept, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)).

  

Going back even further, two pioneers in their fields, **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)), went public within six months of each other at the start of the 1990s.

  

To understand the actual technology from companies like Qualcomm or **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)), investors often must read extensively as well as learn from the insights provided by analysts and others familiar with the technology. That's where IBD's [New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm) and Internet & Technology sections come in.

  

For more consumer-oriented offerings, first-hand experience is often the best way for an investor to determine just how innovative their target company is.

  

No matter how innovative the firm, fundamentals always count. Keep in mind that innovative companies often make for lousy stocks. An innovative product is only one ingredient of a successful stock. Management must come up with an enlightened business plan, and then execute at high levels to manage finances, workforce, production, distribution, sales and marketing, and the company's network of suppliers.

  

Debt, return on equity, profit margins and cash flow are all key metrics to track, along with sales and earnings. Support by mutual funds is also crucial. Do a fast check of all these gauges by using [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) on Investors.com and the research tables in the paper (starting on this page).

  

**General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), with its nuclear facilities engineering, jet engines, sea water filtration and wind energy technologies, is a jewel in the U.S. crown as a leading innovator. But its sales have not increased in almost five years. The stock trades 36% below a 2007 peak of 42.15 and deep in the shadows of its record high in 2000.

  

Even the best growth names aren't always a thrill a minute. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) introduced its highly innovative and successful iPod in October 2001, nearly three years before the stock broke out in August 2004 and took off for good.

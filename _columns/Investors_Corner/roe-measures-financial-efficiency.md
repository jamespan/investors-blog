Earnings-per-share and sales increases are important fundamental data to look at. Investors should also check out a firm's return on equity. ROE measures how well a company's managers are growing profit as a percentage of the company's overall net assets.

The higher the ROE figure, the more profit is being generated for every dollar of equity. IBD research shows leading stocks tend to have an ROE of 17% or more.

High ROEs indicate that a company is making smart decisions with shareholders' money.

To compute a company's ROE, divide annual net income by the average of shareholders' equity over the past two years. You can find net income on a company's income statement and stockholders' equity on the balance sheet.

You can quickly see a company's ROE in [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) on [Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/) and [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com/) .

ROE is also a part of IBD's SMR Rating, featured daily in the stock research tables.

While ROE is treated as a measure of financial efficiency, it can be broken down into three components: profit margins, a measure of how much sales are being generated from net assets, and leverage. From this manner, divide net income by sales to get net profit margin. Next divide sales by average total assets. This is your sales turnover. Lastly, divide average total assets by average shareholder equity. ROE is the product of all three.

Companies with more debt (higher leverage) will often have bigger ROEs. So looking at just the ROE figure won't tell you the whole story. If a company's ROE is much larger than its peers, check to see if it's really posting magnificent profit or if it carries a big load of debt.

Pizza chain **Papa John's International** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)) had an ROE of 65% in 2014, up from 43% in 2013 and 33% in 2012. The stock, No. 36 in Monday's IBD 50, has been in a solid uptrend for years and recently cleared a 66.05 buy point from a flat base. However, Papa John's is highly levered. At the end of 2014, it had more than \$230 million in long-term debt and just \$99 million in equity.

Supply chain software firm **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)) has zero long-term debt and a stout ROE of 49% in 2014. The company's earnings grew 22% to 67% in the past five years, with sales growth in the double digits.

A publicly traded company has to do a lot right for its stock to enjoy a big price gain. A consistent track record of earnings and sales growth helps.


High return on equity (ROE) doesn't hurt either.


ROE is a key measurement of profitability. It's calculated by dividing annual net income by average shareholders' equity over the past two years.


Simply put, return on equity helps separate well-managed companies from poorly managed ones. Decades of IBD research show that past market winners had an annual ROE of at least 17% at the start of their big runs. Big, institutional-quality leaders often showed ROE of 25% to 50%.


IBD's Sales + Profit Margins + ROE (SMR) Rating identifies stocks that are strong on all three fronts. Stocks are rated on an A-E scale, with A for stocks in the top 20 percent of all stocks in IBD's database.


However, if you find a company where ROE is light, don't automatically dismiss it, especially if other pieces of the puzzle fit. If annual pretax margin is sound — say, at least 17% to 20% — and the company has other things going for it such as big earnings and sales growth, and outstanding mutual fund sponsorship and relative price strength, that's usually good enough.


A heavy debt load can skew a high ROE. The denominator in the annual ROE calculation is assets minus liabilities. High debt can shrink the denominator, resulting in an inflated ROE percentage.


In a recent IBD 50, the average ROE was 28%. In the nearby table, the long-term debt-to-equity ratio at **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)) is low at 48%, but **CDW** ([CDW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDW)) and **Team Health** ([TMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMH)) had lofty debt-to-equity ratios of 400% and 181%, respectively, in 2013.


[New issues](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) sometimes don't measure up on the ROE front, but that doesn't mean that they can't deliver big gains. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) has been a big winner since its debut in July 2012 at 42. ROE was 13% in 2012 and 7% in 2013, but it hasn't stopped high-quality fund sponsors from accumulating the stock.

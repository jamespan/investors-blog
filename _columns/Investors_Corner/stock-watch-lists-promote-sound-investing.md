  Creating A Stock Watch List Helps You Stay Prepared

Creating a watch list from the thousands of stocks on offer is a daunting task. It's hard to know where to start. But every investor should have a list of stocks to track in both good times and in bad, as growth stocks can move very fast.


Timing your purchases is important.


Failure to create a list can leave you sitting on the sidelines in the next great market uptrend, when top-notch growth stocks break out of bases in large numbers. Or worse, you may end up buying the first stock you see in a desperate attempt to ride the uptrend, only to watch the stock falter because it turned out to have many flaws.


IBD screens for stocks that meet a wide range of parameters, including stock price, average daily volume, and other fundamental and technical characteristics. The stocks featured in these screens — such as the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/), Your Weekly Review and the [Sector Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/sector-leaders-review.htm) — have gone through a rigorous computer-based vetting process.


However, that doesn't mean they're an automatic buy.


Though most of the market's biggest winners have shown up in the IBD 50 or other IBD screens before launching their runs, not all are successful. It's up to the investor to narrow down the list through further research.


Improve your timing with the help of good daily and weekly charts.


The IBD 50 (published every day in IBD Leaderboard), the Stock Spotlight (published every day), Your Weekly Review (every Friday) and IBD Big Cap 20 (every Tuesday) offer good watch-list candidates.


The charts that accompany these columns help you identify which stocks are in the strongest industry group, have the strongest profit and sales growth, and trade near buy points.


Meanwhile, the [New America section](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm) highlights promising companies with innovative products, or those experiencing strong growth due to changing industry or economic conditions.


Investors.com can also help you build a watch list. The home page's Stocks On the Move screen identifies stocks moving in heavy volume, a sign of strong support from deep-pocketed mutual funds and other institutional investors. [IBD Screen Center](http://research.investors.com/) features stocks ranked on a wide range of criteria.


When you have picked out what you consider to be the best stocks on offer, go to [Stock Checkup](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/761773-how-to-pick-a-stock.htm) under the research tab at Investors.com. The Stock Checkup shows how the stock fares against its peers in five key IBD fundamental metrics. It also provides more information on a stock's sales and profit history, as well as institutional sponsorship.


Then look at each stock's daily and weekly charts to determine whether its base is sound and identify the correct buy point.


**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Fleetmatics** ([FLTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLTX)) — the two stocks accompanying this column — have inhabited IBD Sector Leaders lately. Their chart descriptions show that they are working on cup-with-handle bases, and buy points are given. Both companies posted strong earnings growth in the latest quarter, but estimates for the current quarter point to milder EPS gains.


If you decide to track these stocks, you can add them to My Stock Lists, a useful tool at Investors.com. You can create up to five lists, each holding up to 50 stocks.

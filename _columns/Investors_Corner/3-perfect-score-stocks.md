Athletes strive for a perfect score in the Olympics, as do students when taking exams. Now, should investors only buy those stocks that boast top-notch ratings? The answer is yes â€” and no.

Yes, they should look for the highest possible ratings when considering stocks to buy. But investors shouldn't buy a stock based solely on those grades.

There are many other fundamental and technical factors to consider. A stock can have perfect ratings across the board, but may not be in a proper buying area. After all, a 99 RS only means it is outperforming 99% of all other stocks.

Average share volume needs to be checked. A stock may be too thinly traded.

One must also ask: Do leading mutual funds own the stock? How are its industry group and the broader market faring? You can find many of these metrics on [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) at Investors.com.

To help illustrate this point, we ran a screen for stocks based on three key IBD ratings: 99 Composite, Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength. Stocks had to be priced over \$12 a share, with an average daily volume of at least 200,000 shares.

Only three stocks met these five criteria today. Let's start with **LGI Homes** ([LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)). Leader in a leading industry group? Check. Its homebuilder group ranked No. 8 in Monday's IBD. A bonus: LGI was the No. 2 stock in the same issue's IBD 50.

Mutual fund sponsorship? Six mutual funds rated A- or higher by IBD added to their LGI stake during the third quarter. Check. The overall market is back in a confirmed uptrend, so that checks out too.

Is it in a proper buy zone? No, because the stock is extended from a rebound off its 50-day moving average. Its last buy point from a base was in August, when the stock cleared a 20.20 entry. It's up more than 60% from there.

In LGI's Building-Residential/Commercial group, **NVR Inc.** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)) also sports a 99 Composite rank. Its RS is a respectable 91.

**MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) is a provider of chips for broadband communications, data center, metro and long-haul transport network applications. It's one of the leaders in the Telecom-Infrastructure group. But the group is a laggard at No. 98.

Six mutual funds rated A- or better took new positions in the stock, while at least 10 others increased their exposure. But like LGI, MaxLinear is also out of buying range.

It initially cleared a 13.06 buy point in early October, before gapping up to a 28% gain. It's now extended well past the entry, as well as the opening price of 14.71 on the gap up.

**Natural Health Trends** ([NHTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NHTC)) rounds out the three perfect-score stocks. The network marketer of skin care products and dietary supplements leads the No. 42-ranked cosmetics/personal care group. Shares are extended from a 41.54 cup-with-handle buy point.

A number of A or A- rated small-cap funds bought new positions or added increased their holdings in Q3. There are no analysts currently covering the company, according to Thomson Reuters.

It's often easier to dig deeper into companies with analyst coverage, as an investor can then see how a company's quarterly results fare vs. Wall Street estimates.

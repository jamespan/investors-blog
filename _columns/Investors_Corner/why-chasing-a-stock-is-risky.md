Chasing a stock is a bad idea from several angles.

One problem is that normal action can make the stock hard to hold. A second problem is that the breaking of one rule often leads to additional rule breaking.

If the stock drops 8% below the chaser's entry, the chaser will be tempted to ignore the 8% sell rule.

Why? The chaser's logic runs something like this: "Yes, I know I'm down 8%, but the stock isn't showing abnormal action for those who bought properly. And isn't that the important thing?"

No, the important thing is that the chaser lost 8%.

Suppose the chaser refuses to sell, and the loss widens, triggering the 8% sell rule for investors who bought properly.

The chaser is now in a psychological bind. To sell now would be to admit to two mistakes. Not to worry: Another round of rule breaking promises salvation.

The chaser notices that a few points lower is the 50-day line. "Isn't that where the stock is sure to find support?" the chaser says.

If the 50-day line fails, the chaser is now the so-called "long-term investor."

Data management software maker **CommVault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)) broke out of a flat base March 14, 2013. The buy point was 79.63 and the 5% buy zone ran to 83.61. Volume was 318% above normal on the breakout.

The stock surged 9% past the buy point and closed 6% above the buy point. In less than a session, the stock was too extended to buy.

Let's say a chaser bought the stock at the 84.20 close, when it was extended. Three days later, the stock revisited the ideal buy point **1**, which represented a loss of 5.5% for the chaser. An investor who bought properly might have sold with little or no profit. Why? Because the 9% gain shrank to nothing intraday. Many investors will take a tiny profit rather than risk going into the red.

Others might have held until April 3, when the stock plunged 5% and broke its 50-day line **2**. From the proper buy point, the stock closed 4% below the ideal entry. (For the chaser, the loss was 9%.)

Many disciplined investors would've been out at 4% because of the 50-day violation. If not, they sold the next day when the stock triggered the 8% sell rule.

For the chaser, the action sank as deep as 13% that day. If the stock wasn't sold there, the chaser had a deficit as deep as 22% by May 23.

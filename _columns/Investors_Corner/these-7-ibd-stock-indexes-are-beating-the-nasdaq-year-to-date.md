Like clutch hitting in baseball, IBD's investment strategy works best when the wind is blowing out and the bases are loaded.

That's essentially what has happened so far this year. The market has provided a tailwind: The Nasdaq is up 27% year to date; the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, 22%; the S&P 500, 17%; and the small cap Russell 2000, 14%.
Meanwhile, the IBD screens are doing exactly what they are supposed to do in good times: Outperform the indexes. Rounded off, here's how the year-to-date gains looked as of Nov. 30:

- Sector Leaders, which is IBD's most stringent screen: up 52%.
- Nasdaq Stock Spotlight, which screens for Nasdaq stocks with strong fundamentals that are in bases or breaking out: up 43%.
- Innovator IBD 50 ETF ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), an exchange traded fund built on the IBD 50: up 36%.
- IBD 50, the classic growth-stock list: up 35%.
- Nasdaq Stocks On The Move, which looks for signs of heavy institutional action: up 34%.
- NYSE Stock Spotlight, which screens for NYSE stocks with strong fundamentals that are in bases or breaking out: up 31%.
- IBD New America, a new-issue index: up 30%.

All seven of the above yardsticks topped the broad stock indexes by solid margins. Two additional IBD screens beat the S&P 500 but were roughly even or modestly behind the Nasdaq's pace:

- NYSE Stocks On The Move, which screens for signs of heavy institutional action: up 29%.
- IBD Big Cap 20, which filters big caps for strong fundamentals and technicals: up 22%.

The Stocks On The Move table can be seen on the homepage of Investors.com, as well as in [Stock Lists](https://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx); a weekly version of this screen is printed in the second section of the IBD Weekly print newspaper.

What can be concluded from this? Three things:

First, give thanks where thanks is due: the stock market itself. The [M in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) — which stands for "market direction" — is the most important ingredient to investing success. A tailwind can make a huge difference in investing.

Second, the folks who say "You can't _time_ the market" deserve a similar reply with a different inflection, "No, _you_ can't time the market."

There are markets that IBD-style investors will sit out because the bear is on the prowl. There are rolling, sideways market that will frustrate even the best growth investors, which is what happened in 2016. But a market that marches steadily upward, as it has in 2017, can be timed for profits.

Monitoring IBD's [ETF Market Timing strategy](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) and reading [The Big Picture stock market column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) on a daily basis will quickly advance your market-timing prowess.

Third, no matter what kind of market an investor is playing, wise stock-picking and sound rules are essential. For example, in the first month of 2017, nine stocks appeared in the Sector Leaders screen for at least one week.

Some never broke out but sagged to losses. Others were choppy, difficult holds.

But two of the nine stocks scored exceptional gains. **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) broke out May 25 and eventually scored a 71% gain in five months.

**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) retook a buy point in January and, for those who sat through a 3% initial pullback, rang up a 57% gain in about 10 months.

Zeroing in on the best isn't always an easy exercise in real time. But a general market that serves up a tailwind for stocks can often be counted on for fresh opportunities.

The investor doesn't have to handle every breakout perfectly in order to find success.

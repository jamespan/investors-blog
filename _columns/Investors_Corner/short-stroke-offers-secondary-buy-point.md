As several of the recent [Investor's Corner columns](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) covering follow-on buying strategies have shown, other potential buy opportunities can arise for investors who know how to spot them.

Today we'll focus on a fairly rare formation called a short stroke, which is a [secondary buy point](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/advanced-buying-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=A011BMT) where an investor can add shares to an existing position that is making money.

Since the pattern can be only spotted on a weekly chart, it can be easily missed. It takes only two weeks to build the formation, so the short stroke is nearly impossible to spot on a daily chart.

So what should you look for?

The stock makes a big move during the first week. It can even gain as much as 50% or more. Then it trades extremely tightly the second week. The second week's high should be lower than that of the first week.

On a weekly chart, the short stroke should look like a long line followed by a short mark near the first week's high. The ideal buy point is 10 cents above the highest price during those two weeks, accompanied by heavy volume when the stock clears the entry.

What this pattern suggests is that demand remains strong in the second week. Sellers aren't scrambling to take profits even after the prior week's sizable gain.

Like a rebound off the 50-day or 10-week moving average, the short stroke is typically a secondary buy point at which one can add shares. But if conditions are right — the stock shows exceptional fundamentals and it's rising amid a healthy market uptrend — investors with strong conviction could use it to take an initial position.

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) set up a short-stroke pattern in late 2005 after a big run-up from its April 2003 lows to its late 2005 highs. The stock surged 12% the week ended Nov. 4, 2005, then climbed less than 1% the following week. The prior week's high was above that of the second week.

It cleared the 62.42 buy point the week ended Nov. 18 and then rose as much as 38% over the next two months.

The chart above shows the iPhone maker's next short stroke, which started with a 10% move the week ended April 27, 2007. The stock added less than 1% the next week, with that week's high slightly below the previous week.

On the weekly chart, the first week looks like a big line **(1)**, with a short line representing the second week, right next to it **(2)**. Apple broke out the week ended May 11, jumping 8% in above-average volume **(3)**.

Investors who added to their position at the 102.60 short-stroke buy point would have seen shares rise as much as 98% from the proper entry through the end of the year. The stock price has continued to run mostly higher since then, trading at more than quadruple its December 2007 high.

Apple's fundamentals were solid as it set up the short-stroke pattern in April 2007. It held Composite, Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings of 92, 98 and 85, respectively, in the April 27, 2007, issue.

Apple also had strong ratings during the first short stroke. From the Nov. 4, 2005, issue: 99 Composite, 98 EPS and 97 RS.

Its Relative Strength line was also at hitting new highs ahead of both short-stroke setups, a bullish sign.

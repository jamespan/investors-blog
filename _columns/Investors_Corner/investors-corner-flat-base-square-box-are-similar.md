If you don't have that much patience, you might like the square-box and flat-base patterns.

These stock chart patterns take the least time to develop out of all of the conventional bases defined by IBD. A square box can form in just four weeks, while the flat base needs five weeks.

These two structures have some other common traits besides their modest length requirements.

Each base is relatively shallow. The correction for each is generally no more than 15%, as opposed to the 20% to 35% that you often see in cup-with-handle or cup-without-handle patterns.

And on a broad level, keep in mind that each base basically represents a stock taking a break amid an advance. This is true of any base, and why it's good to buy when a stock clears a base.

But the square box and flat base do have some differences.

For starters, the square box is generally no more than seven weeks long, while the flat base can be very long â€” a year or more.

The two consolidations also have different shapes.

The square box, as you would expect, is boxy in its appearance. The flat base shows sideways action, sometimes looking like the long sine waves that you might have studied in geometry class.

A good example of a square box occurred in late 2010, when **InterDigital** ([IDCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IDCC)) etched such a pattern **1**. The wireless technology developer broke out of this pattern Dec. 8, moving past a buy point at 36.91.

Note that the base was just four weeks long, and the stock corrected 11%. InterDigital advanced as much as 58% from its ideal entry point, before falling back to earth hard in late February.

A good example of a flat base also occurred at the end of last year.

**Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) etched such a pattern **2**. The buy point was at 428.20. Note that this consolidation was nearly eight weeks long, and it featured some undulating action.

Priceline finished working on this flat base in 2010's last week. It surged out of the base in the first week of 2011.

The online travel broker was up as much as 31% by early May. At that point it started to consolidate again as the broader market fell into a correction.

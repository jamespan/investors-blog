The Weekly Review runs in every Friday's paper and is one of IBD's most extensive screens.

How extensive? In a roaring market, you may see upward of 140 stocks each week. IBD prints mini charts of up to 120 of them.

To make the list, a stock must have an Earnings Per Share Rating and Relative Price Strength Rating of at least 85. Hence, it is also known as the IBD 85-85 Index.

Stocks must sell for at least 10 a share, trade an average of 10,000 or more shares a day and be within 15% of a 52-week price high.

The stocks are sorted by the strength of their industry group in terms of six-month price gains. So stocks in the top performing groups among 197 tracked by IBD get listed at the top. That makes the Weekly Review screen a great way to spot the top stocks in the top groups.

If the market is in a correction, don't be surprised to see the number of stocks on the screen fall.

Be careful not to buy a stock just because it is on the screen. The screen is a watch list for further study and analysis.

The screen's minimum 10,000- share-a-day requirement is low. For the most part, investors should look for stocks trading at least 400,000 shares a day. Those are the stocks bought most regularly by institutional investors.

Investors should also seek higher-priced stocks. A \$40 stock trading 500,000 shares a day has an average dollar volume of \$20 million, so look for an average dollar volume of at least \$20 million.

Weekly Review mini charts give the EPS increase for only the most recent quarter. An investor should also check earnings going back several quarters. And it's a good idea to demand stocks with EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings well above 85. The big winners usually have ratings in the 90s or even the high 90s.

Let's look at the Weekly Review screen for July 5, 2013. A quick look down the list shows a setup. It's **Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)), which makes anti-aging products **(1)**. It had just launched a new product and was getting a foothold in the promising Chinese market.

At the time, it had a five-year annualized growth rate of 29%, quarterly EPS growth of 22%, an EPS Rating of 96 and an RS of 93.

The blurb beneath the chart said, "Consolidating above 10- week line; potential buy at 63.45." The stock broke out that very day and rose 121% before topping in early January.

In a healthy market, investors normally find no shortage of stocks in or near valid bases.

Other times, the cupboard appears bare, and the particular stocks you are interested in are maddeningly close to, but not quite, forming a real base.

This may be a time when opportunity favors the bold.

Sometimes, a truly solid chart pattern doesn't quite fit all the characteristics of a sound base. Yet it provides just enough wiggle room for assertive investors to plot buy points.

It will be a higher-risk base than those that fit the standard profiles. But if a stock is fundamentally strong and the overall market is positive, the opportunity may outweigh the risk.

Consider **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)), which has been one of the leaders in the biotech sector. The stock cleared a hard-to-define pattern in early April and ran up 50% by May 15. It's too deep for a flat base and not exactly rounded enough to be a cup, either. Yet there was clearly a resistance point near 180 to 185. Quiet action in March created a handle on what was essentially an amorphous base.

Keep in mind that buy points, whether in cups with handles, double-bottom bases or flat bases, often represent points of resistance that follow a mild, final shakeout of weak shareholders.

Now, some bases are truly poor in quality and should be avoided.

The wide, loose trading and unpredictable action that creates undifferentiated patterns is signaling uncertainty. It can also be a sign of volatile turnover, with buyers and sellers at odds and jockeying. In this scenario, a breakout is rarely successful.

Many times, this turmoil works itself out and settles over time. Look at **Web.com** ([WWWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WWWW)). Starting in July last year, it shaped three side-by-side bases. Each base became more civilized â€” that is, the price action became tighter from week to week. The third base showed several positive reversals. Web.com broke out of the tight, final base in May. In this case, an investor was better off to sit out the undefined bases until the boiling uncertainty cooled.

China-based search engine leader **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) was midway in its 26-month run when it formed what, at first glance looked like a flat base in May and June 2010. The pattern was 20% deep from high to low, however. **(1)** It was too deep to be a flat base. By June 25, it was six weeks long, just long enough to be a cup.

Then it slipped down for another three weeks. At this point, the 82.39 buy point on the base's left-side high was a long stretch. The pattern suggested a more aggressive buy point at 78.69.

The stock rose through that buy point in soft trade. It then pulled back into a more conventional, six-week cup base. **(2)**

The stock rose 98% from the 78.69 buy point through April 2011 before raising red flags that its run was ending.

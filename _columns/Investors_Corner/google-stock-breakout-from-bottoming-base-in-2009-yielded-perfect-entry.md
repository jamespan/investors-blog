A monthly chart for Google stock, officially known as Alphabet, shows a huge price gain since the company's IPO in August 2004. The long-term uptrend started with a breakout from an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/), and expanded with additional breakouts from consolidation areas and more defined patterns like the [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) and [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).

But Google operator Alphabet cleared another type of pattern just after the major indexes confirmed a new uptrend in March 2009. In mid-April, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) cleared a bottoming base with a 381.10 entry. The [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) formed after the Nasdaq plunged 43% in 2008 as a result of the financial crisis.

[Bottoming bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/) aren't hard to recognize, as long as you know what to look for. First and foremost, they form after a sharp decline for the stock market when the stock is well off highs. What makes them special is that they tend to form without a lot of fanfare, when they're not on everyone's radar.

## Google Stock: Bottoming Base In 2009 Was Ideal Entry

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ICgoog091420-300x161.jpg)Keep in mind that [bases normally form](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) after a prior uptrend. That's a distinction of the bottoming base, which forms without one or with a minor prior uptrend.

Google hit a low of 247.30 in November 2008. But it rallied sharply from there, hitting a high of 381 in February. That's when it started forming the bottoming base **(1)**. The cup base was nine weeks long and the breakout was during the week ended April 17, 2009, when shares jumped 5.3% in higher volume **(2)**.

One potential issue with breakouts from bottoming bases is that [overhead supply](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) can be an issue. Overhead supply is selling pressure that arises from buyers on the way down who sell to break even on their investment when the stock starts rallying. Indeed, Google stock looked like it was on sale when it was plunging in the second half of 2008.

But overhead supply wasn't an issue for Google stock when it cleared the bottoming base. After the breakout, it came down to its 10-week moving average and found support. It rallied 17% from the 381 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) before settling into a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). It cleared a new base with a 447.34 entry in late July **(3)**.

The 2020 coronavirus bear market resulted in many growth stocks forming bottoming bases. **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) was one. It soared out of a cup base at 63.80 during the week ended Aug. 28, 2020.

The base formed after Shake Shack more than doubled after a hitting a low of 30.10 in March. Earnings growth has been uneven in recent quarters, and a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 64 at the time was poor. But Shake Shack rallied back anyway on optimism that the pandemic was abating.

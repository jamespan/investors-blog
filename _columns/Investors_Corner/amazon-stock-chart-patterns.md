Learning stock chart patterns is a useful skill to get into winning stocks before they break out. Among the handful of patterns worth mastering is the [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and a variation called a cup-without-handle base.




Amazon stock was one winner born out of a cup without handle, as we'll explain here. Bullish base patterns are most commonly built following a prior uptrend of at least 20% to 30%. Once a stock rallies that much, it will usually pause to form a new base.


Both the cup with handle and cup without handle base begin by forming a "U" shaped pattern. They are identified by [MarketSurge pattern recognition](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge) on daily and weekly charts.


The bottom of the base shakes out weak holders before the stock reverses and begins building the right side of the cup.


If a stock climbs then retreats and takes a break for at least a week before breaking out, it may form a handle. A [proper handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) should form in the upper half of the base and be no deeper than 12%. The handle serves as a final place to get rid of weak hands, before the stock climbs in earnest.


Key Features Of Cup Without Handle
----------------------------------


In a cup without handle, the stock doesn't pause. Instead, it bursts to new highs right from the cup.


A cup without handle must be at least six weeks long, though it can last for months. The cup should be no deeper than 33% from the beginning of the base to the bottom of the formation. The buy point is the stock's prior high.


Like in other base breakouts, the [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) goes from the buy point to 5% higher.


The breakout should come in volume at least 40% above the stock's average over the past 50 days. (Volume bars with the 50-day moving average are shown in IBD Charts and MarketSurge.)


Amazon Stock, JPMorgan Bases
----------------------------


**![jpm](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IC032534-268x300.jpg)JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) formed a cup base in August through November **(1)**. The base had a choppy bottoming area, but still could be viewed as a cup pattern.


Shares broke out the week of Dec. 15 **(2)** in volume well above the weekly average **(3)**. JPMorgan climbed to an all-time high on Tuesday and has gained over 21% since the breakout.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) formed a cup base that began in September 2023 after an excellent run from its January 2023 low. The stock declined 19% as it formed the base.


Shares broke out past 145.86 buy point the week of Nov. 17. Volume climbed from the prior week. Amazon stock climbed around 23% to a 52-week high in March.

In February 1988, less than four years after the birth of Investor's Business Daily, founder William O'Neil's "[How to Make Money in Stocks](https://www.investors.com/offer/splash.aspx?id=htmmis)" hit the shelves.

  

Nearly 25 years later, the McGraw-Hill best-seller continues to make a real impact on the daily habits and lives of investors.

  

By "investors," we're not just talking about your office mate or your gym buddy who dabbles in stocks.

  

A sizable number of professional investors also embrace the rules and principles taught by O'Neil's books and elaborated every weekday in IBD and 24/7 at Investors.com.

  

Want proof? Take a look at the newest addition to IBD's educational library: "[How to Make Money in Stocks Success Stories: New and Advanced Investors Share Their Winning Secrets](https://www.investors.com/stocksuccessbook)."

  

The book, written by Amy Smith, is a fresh glimpse at some of the most savvy money managers and individuals who have created wealth by focusing on the market's trend, picking stocks with outstanding fundamentals and using charts for timely buy and sells.

  

Smith, who co-hosts IBD's weekly radio show, shares candid experiences of a broad spectrum of people. The aim: to prove that anyone who is willing to learn, follow common-sense rules, and keep his or her ego in check can win in stocks.

  

It may seem a guilty pleasure to judge the market as a zero-sum game in which winners and losers balance each other out. If that's true, then how do you land on the greener side? The profiles found in the book may help.

  

They include Mike Webster, one of O'Neil's in-house portfolio managers and the creator of IBD's Stock Checkup; and Dave Whitmer, who learned the value of the N in CAN SLIM and made an i-popping gain in Apple call options in 2007.

  

The book also features Gay Walsh, a TV writer who joined several IBD Meetup groups and learned the value of using charts; and Barbara James, who repeated her success with tech stock giants during the 1990s with big gains in new winners during the topsy-turvy 2000s.

  

Smith, a martial arts enthusiast, sees parallels between tae kwon do and trading stocks. Rules of behavior permeate inside a dojo, or training room, and she learned to follow and respect them. When Smith began learning the IBD systems, "It made investing easier with rules to follow, instead of guessing," she said.

  

Smith adds that a former teacher, the ninth-degree black belt Hee Il Cho, and O'Neil both share lasting values of humility, which is vital to long-term success in their crafts. "If Master Cho thought he was a hotshot, he'd lose his ability to be a great martial artist," she said.

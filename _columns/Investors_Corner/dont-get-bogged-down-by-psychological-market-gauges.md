Some people collect psychological stock market indicators the way kids used to collect baseball cards.

  

A kid would fill boxes with cards, season after season — even cards of players of no interest. Eventually, the kid went away to college, and Mom tossed the entire collection in a frenzy of decluttering.

  

Mom was wrong about old baseball cards, but she'd probably be doing you a favor if she could get inside your mental closet and thin your collection of psychological indicators.

  

Many indicators work for a time and then quit working. To grasp the market's trend, none are as dependable as the action of the market itself. But people keep them around. Mom would know what to do with them.

  

"All you need is the price and volume action of the indexes," says Mom. "That's why I threw away those junky old indicators. They were just taking up space."

  

In the past two days, we looked at two indicators — Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears ratio and the puts vs. calls gauge. Today we look at other psychological indicators.

  

•CBOE Market Volatility Index: This is a measure of fear. It gauges the market's expectation for volatility. Above 50 is bullish. The gauge has a mixed record. The five-year high of 103.4 was made on Oct. 10, 2008 — five months before the bear market's low.

  

•Mutual Fund Share Purchases/Redemptions: The idea is that when fund purchases rise and redemptions fall, the funds have more cash. Thus the market finds fuel. The five-year high was Dec. 1, 2006, not a significant juncture.

  

•Nasdaq daily trading volume as a percentage of NYSE daily volume: Once a speculation gauge, "This measure provided a helpful tip-off of impending trouble during the summer of 1983, when Nasdaq volume increased significantly relative to the Big Board's," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

But Nasdaq trade has grown. It's no longer a speculation gauge.

  

•Number of Stock Splits in IBD 6000 (prior 30 days): A large number could signal a market top.

  

•New Issues in Last Year as Percentage of All Stocks on NYSE: A high ratio points to speculation and a potential market top.

  

•Price-to-Book Value of Dow Jones Industrial Average: This valuation gauge reached a five-year low on Feb. 23, 2009, about a week before the bear market's low.

  

•Price to Earnings Ratio of the Dow: The five-year low was hit on July 5, 2010, right after a short-term low in the Dow.

  

•Current Dividend Yield of the Dow: On March 11, 2009, IBD's Income Investor column asked: "Blue Chip Yields At 5-Year High — A Bullish Signal?" The next day the market delivered a follow-through day. But the yield can hit a five-year high long before the market bottoms. The yield was at a five-year high in March 2008 — well before the current bull market began.

In searching for stocks ready to make a big move, investors should understand that significant earnings growth is good, but earnings acceleration is better.


Acceleration occurs when the rate of year-over-year increases in earnings per share rises. It's hard enough for a company to grow earnings at, say, 25% quarter after quarter and year after year. But to grow at 25%, then accelerate that to 50% and maintain that pace, is super hard. A company that can achieve that deserves a close look from investors.


Studies by IBD founder and chairman William O'Neil show that earnings acceleration occurred in almost every case sometime in the 10 quarters prior to a stock breaking out and making a big upward move.


A likely reason behind earnings acceleration is that something new has occurred in the company. Possibly a new product or service, new management, or emerging new markets have propelled the company to a new scale of growth. CAN SLIM investors know this is the N in IBD's [CAN SLIM system](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) of investing criteria and they should do some homework to understand what that is.


Care should be taken if a sudden burst in EPS growth is due to a merger or major acquisition. Without some catalyst beyond that, the investor should question if the acceleration can last longer than the first four quarters from when the merger was made. Also, be wary of companies that are posting decelerating profit growth. Their stocks may be near a top in the market.


A good way to see if a stock you are considering for purchase has earnings acceleration is to look it up in IBD's proprietary [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) feature. An easy way to get to Stock Checkup is to type a ticker into the box in the upper right hand corner of IBD's Investors.com home page and hit return to get an expanded quote with a chart and additional details. Above the chart, you'll see five small icons. One of them contains a check mark. That takes you to Stock Checkup, which analyzes a company and stock by a host of fundamental and technical criteria critical to a CAN SLIM investor.


One of the fundamental criteria is #Qtrs of EPS Acceleration. There you will see if your company has current quarterly earnings acceleration and, if so, how long. A more detailed history of earnings and earnings increases is available on MarketSmith, a sister company of IBD.


Take the current example of **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)). The real estate investment trust owns and operates data centers. It's a member of the property REIT industry group, which has been hot recently.


In the June-ended second quarter of 2014, the company reported a 13% increase in funds from operations (a standard metric for profits in the REIT industry) from the previous year. The following quarter's earnings increase came in at 17%. Then things started getting interesting, as FFO jumped 24%, 25%, 33% and 35% in the most recent quarter. That's five straight quarters of  growth acceleration.


In October 2014, CoreSite jumped out of a seven-week cup with a 36.57 buy point and has staged a strong rally. The Earnings Per Share Rating is a best possible 99; other IBD SmartSelect Ratings are also impressive.

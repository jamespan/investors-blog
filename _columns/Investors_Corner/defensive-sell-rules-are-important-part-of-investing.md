**How To Sell Winners Like A Pro II:** [First In A Series](http://news.investors.com/special-report/623411-sell-like-a-pro-ii-defense.aspx)

  

Defense is a key part of investing.

  

Things aren't always going to come up roses. You have to take action when a stock — even a winner — isn't moving in your favor.

  

On some days, what a stock does can test you. One such case is when a stock breaches its 50-day moving average in a big way and does not rebound.

  

When this happens, don't be a deer in the headlights. Depending on the exact situation, investors may need to sell into weakness to cut losses. Doing so will protect any existing profits and avoid turning a winning trade into a losing one, which is a sin.

  

The 50-day moving average is a key tool used by retail and professional investors. Many times, leading stocks will pull back and find support at or near the line.

  

Generally, institutions like to buy on weakness and will come in to support a stock that's pulling back to the 50-day line. Their buying causes the stock to rebound.

  

But when a stock breaks the moving average and fails to recover, it could mean one of several things.

  

First, it could be just a shakeout.

  

The stock can go slightly below the 50-day line and stay there for days or even a few weeks before staging a comeback. The stock can close a couple of percentage points below the line and not act as a sell signal. But if it ends 5% to 6% or more below, especially in heavy volume, one should sell. The big funds are unloading their positions in a big way.

  

Investors should also dump shares if the stock has already had a long, sharp advance and breaks the 50-day line in vastly higher trade. Another instance to sell is when the stock breaks the 50-day line after finding support there on previous occasions.

  

**Travelzoo** ([TZOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TZOO)), the online publisher of travel deals, had a huge rally after it broke out from a first-stage cup-with-handle base on April 30, 2004. The stock tested its 50-day line in late June, July and August. Travelzoo pulled back to the line several times in October **1**, but kept climbing.

  

On Jan. 7, 2005, the stock closed a hair below its 50-day. Two sessions later, Travelzoo breached the line in light yet accelerating trade. It also closed 11% below the line. **2** That was the sell signal; the stock fell another 39% in 23 days.

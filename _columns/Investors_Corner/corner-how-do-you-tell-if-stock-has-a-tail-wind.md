A tail wind can make a big difference for a stock.

Buy a stock that faces a stiff head wind, and the odds shift against you. The stock could fail, or at least make slower progress.

Buy a stock that enjoys a tail wind or two, and things often go much smoother.

How do you tell if a stock has a tail wind working for it?

Three major factors work to provide a tail wind for a stock. The first is the market itself. Roughly three of every four stocks will rise in a bull market. So, you never want to set yourself in opposition to that most basic of trends.

The other two factors are a stock's sector and its industry group. Decades of IBD research show that a stock's sector and industry group account for almost half of the stock's performance.

**Industry Group Vs. Sector**

How do the sector and the industry group differ, and which of the two is more important?

A sector is a broad collection of industries and companies. The sector includes groupings such as retail, utilities, mining and so on.

Research shows that about 12% of a stock's performance is tied to the strength of its sector.

IBD's stock tables are arranged by 33 sectors. They are ranked by sector strength. You can find your stock in the tables, or if you are unsure what sector it is in, type the ticker symbol into the Get Quote box at Investors.com. The sector label is listed left on the page, just above the price.

An industry group is a smaller grouping within a sector. For example, the retail sector includes such industry groups as restaurants, apparel stores and the discount stores.

Research shows that about 37% of a stock's move is tied to its industry group.

So theoretically, the strength of the industry group is more important than the sector's. Ideally, you want both working for your stock. And you always want the market itself to be in a confirmed uptrend.

However, conditions are seldom perfect. If you have to settle for two out of three, the market trend and the industry group are the two that have the most influence.

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) broke out of a base-on-base pattern on Sept. 20, 2010 **1**. Volume jumped 40% above average when it crossed the 88.42 buy point.

The market was in a confirmed uptrend, providing the most important tail wind for Baidu.

The China-based company's Internet-Content group was No. 30 of 197 industry groups, offering a second tail wind.

Baidu's Internet sector was only No. 14 of 33 sectors. While that wasn't sufficiently weak to be creating head winds, it wasn't strong enough to be considered a definite tail wind.

The Web search leader advanced as much as 76% to a high of 156.04 in eight months **2**.

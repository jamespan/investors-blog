  New Screen At MarketSmith Helps Investors Navigate Stock Price Volatility

MarketSmith, a provider of charts and data aimed at helping investors make more money in the stock market, has recently introduced new tools to help investors take advantage of sharp stock price movements.


The service requires a separate subscription, but investors can sign up for a trial at the newly added orange [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen&src=A012BF2) tab at Investors.com.  




New features this year include a screen to help investors navigate [breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gaps-signal-strength/). These occur when a stock opens sharply higher than the previous day's close, leaving a gap between the current day's low and the previous day's high.


The pattern is a powerful symbol of a stock's strength, a sign that institutional investors are "falling all over themselves to grab these stocks," said MarketSmith manager Irusha Peiris. "A lot of super stocks -- **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) -- started with breakaway gaps."


Breakaway gaps have become much more common since the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted rules in 2000 requiring publicly traded companies to disclose important information to all investors at the same time.


Before that, companies would often leak market-moving information piecemeal in meetings with analysts or other market professionals, putting other investors at a disadvantage. "When analysts talked to management all the time, management might divulge information," Peiris said. "Now they can't do that."

Earnings have become an especially gut-wrenching time for shareholders, since stocks can move wildly depending on the results.


"We've always known how important earnings are, but with all these vicious gaps up and down we're trying to help customers stay on top of it," Peiris said.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) is an example of a stock that gapped up twice in 2010, the first time on April 22 and the second time on Oct. 22 in the midst of an advance that saw the stock quadruple from a breakout over a 98.76 cup-base entry in January of that year. At the time, the burrito and taco chain was posting solid profit and sales growth.


"It's sometimes the second gap up that really accelerates the stock," Peiris said, adding "the gaps up are a potential new source of ideas."


The screen captures both earnings gaps up and down. It also flags stocks in the screen with earnings coming up, giving investors a chance to sell shares to minimize the risk of a sharp earnings-related sell-off, or use [IBD's options strategy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/using-options-to-minimize-earnings-risk/) to maximize upside potential while minimizing downside risk.


"Hopefully that will help our customers avoid a gap down," Peiris said. "If a lot of breakaway gaps fail, maybe the market isn't so good." Breakaway gaps are kept on the screen for 90 days to evaluate their performance.


A feature on earnings-related gaps up was added this past week, along with a service that sends e-mails to customers every Friday that lists top stocks reporting earnings the following week. Another email identifies stocks that have gapped up or down following their quarterly earnings reports.

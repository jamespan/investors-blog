The stock market can at first be a disappointing place for those who seek symmetry and balance.




A [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) is a pattern that only occasionally sketches a proportionate design. Unlike the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/), double bottoms are often distorted and difficult to recognize.


The base is roughly a "W," with the buy point plotted a dime above the center peak. The right lobe should at least slightly undercut the left, signaling a second, hopefully a last, shakeout of low-conviction investors.


When the stock rebounds up the right side of the W, past the center-point pivot, it's breakout time. On the occasions when the base's right side mirrors the left, they may be signaling a stock ready to make a serious run.

**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) are among the stocks to have launched out of a solid double bottom early in their advances.



**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) formed a double-bottom base stretching from February through mid-July of 2013. It was an easy base to miss.


The stock had plummeted after its IPO, disappointing investors and launching a series of lawsuits over the company's pricing of its IPO.


The stock swung down into a deep, nine-month [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). It cleared the buy point by pennies, then reversed to begin building its double-bottom base.


The Double Bottom Base, And What's To Like
------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ICfb091119-300x161.jpg)Most investors were soured and not looking for a base. But those who had their eyes open saw the stock build a first lobe 13 weeks long **(1)**. The second, 11 weeks **(2)**.


The base was preceded by a healthy 85% rise. The structure had two primary flaws: It formed largely below its 10-week moving average, and deeply below its 52-week high. It had retaken and narrowly held support at its 10-week line for two weeks prior to the breakout.


On July 25, Facebook reported a huge second-quarter earnings beat on a much larger than expected surge in mobile ad sales. The 58% profit increase on a 53% jump in revenue showed acceleration vs. the first quarter.


The stock cleared not only the 29.17 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) with a massive gap-up move, it cleared the entire base. Volume came in strong for three weeks in a row **(3)**. Big funds were clearly accumulating shares with abandon.


Shares rose more than 20% to trigger the eight-week hold rule within three days. In nine weeks, it had cleared its IPO day best and moved on to new high ground.

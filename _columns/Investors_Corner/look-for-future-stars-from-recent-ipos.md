Stocks are like people. They put in their best performances while still enjoying the fresh blush of youth. (Some, of course, are late bloomers.)


Research shows that stocks often put in their best gains within the first 15 years of going public. (Not long ago, IBD's guideline was restricted to eight years or less.)


A raft of reasons explains this youthful exuberance.


The biggest factor is the N — for New — in CAN SLIM. Big, stodgy companies can come up with new products, new ideas or new technologies. But the added revenue may hardly move the needle.


Often it's the young guns that come in with a new way of doing things. In fact, that's often why the young company was formed in the first place. Maybe the new idea is an energy drink, a niche no one knew existed before Hansen Natural (now known as **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) came out with its eponymous energy drink. The funny-looking cans hit the shelves, and a star is born. What's more, being a new concept, where's the competition? There isn't any for some time.


Then, too, consider the different corporate structures of big vs. small. The young guns take out some office space and get to work on their brainchild. The new idea may well already exist, but the small firm's efforts are focused on complete execution.


Now take a new idea and put it in the mid-management level of  **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)). A flash of brilliance can easily get lost in that mammoth company. Navigating the ocean of bureaucracy seems a very daunting task. Some entrenched powers may fear change. They're experts at doing things a certain way.


But OK, let's say IBM recognizes the new idea. After all, this is a company that has survived for decades in an industry that thrives on new developments. We know that new ideas do get to the execution stage.


Now you must deal with the economic impact of this new idea on the company.


So IBM develops a new technology that puts a new twist on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology to help keep computer networks safe and efficient.


That new unit would be very profitable. But against the backdrop of IBM's mammoth billings, the stock would likely benefit only mildly.


Take that same new technology — and the genius who created it — and start a new company. Let's just call it **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)). We'll base it in Israel and market to companies all over the world. That very same idea, rather than being lost in the shuffle, becomes the force behind one of the market's hottest stocks. The stock has powered 85% since moving past an early 61.50 buy point in June. **1**

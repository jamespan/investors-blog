A great company is like a high-performance Porsche. Volume is the stock's fuel. If you desire to master when to sell stocks correctly, remember this analogy.




You can blather all day about the company's potential, its fabulous new product, its incredible CEO. But if the company's stock, after making a great run, begins to hit new highs in low volume, it will likely cease to act like a high-performance roadster. Yet in fact, the stock may be beginning to put on the brakes on its spectacular run.


When new highs keep occurring in low volume, it's prime time to be watching for serious sell signals.


After a stock sees a volume dry-up at the peak, be ready to sell at least some shares when a stock drops very hard through the 50-day moving average in gigantic volume. Or the stock may shatter a long-term trend line.

Did the stock get socked really hard after breaking out of a [badly formed late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/)? If so, it's time to get your defensive game on.


The Difference Between Heavy Volume And Light Volume
----------------------------------------------------



Please go to a [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at IBD and look at the bottom part of each chart. Each vertically-aligned bar represents how many shares a stock traded each session. It's easy to tell on any given day whether trading increased vs. the prior day, decreased, or stayed virtually the same.


See the 50-day average volume line, drawn in red, draped across the high end of those volume bars? The level of that line shows how many shares exchanged hands each day over the 50 most recent trading days. It's called a "moving average" because after a session on Wall Street is over, a new daily volume figure has been born. Thus, a new average over the past 50 days is created; the average keeps moving.


The 50-day  makes it easy to spot trends in turnover. The 10-week moving average shows typical weekly turnover over the past 10 weeks, on a weekly chart.


When To Sell Stocks: Use The 50-Day Line
----------------------------------------


A stock's volume often tracks above its 50-day moving average when a stock's price climbs to new high ground. This is where this stock has never been before. There is no [overhead resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/), and buyers should be luring offers with their increasing bids.


If this doesn't drum up increased volume, you have a problem. Remember, too, that the uptrending stock already has had institutional support behind it. That's how it got to be an uptrending stock.


What do you think would happen if the big-money funds stopped buying? The stock would fall under its own weight.


And if you see that stock consistently making new highs without solid volume, that's a sign that the tide may be turning. That is, sellers may have more influence over the stock's future prices than the buyers.


**CME Group** ([CME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CME)) shows how volume served as a gauge for the stock's health. The operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures and options market built a cup from August 2003 to January 2004. [The base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) showed just a few weeks of high-volume selling during the stock's descent, and more weeks of high-volume buying on the right side of its base.

Plenty Of Gas
-------------


CME ran up five weeks in a row in mostly heavy volume **(1)**. That great price-and-volume action not only put the finishing touches on the base. It sparked a [fine breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Even after the stock got extended from a 79.40 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), the gains in high volume continued. In the week ended Feb. 27, 2004, CME shot up 9.7% to new highs in volume that jumped 67% above the weekly average **(2)**.


Now look at CME's two-week-long dip near its 10-week moving average in late March **(3)**. Declines were mild. Volume in one of those two weeks dried up. Volume really picked up in the ensuing four weeks as CME lurched into new highs **(4)**.


A [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) formed from July to September 2004. The breakout in the week ended Sept. 24 showed another volume surge **(5)**.


Running Near Empty
------------------


Let's study CME's behavior in December. New highs again, but volume settled into an eerie quietness **(6)**. You could have taken that as a serious warning from a well-behaving stock.


At the time, its IBD ratings were fantastic: a 99 EPS, a 97 Relative Strength. But this Porsche, which had taken you so far for years, had run out of gas.


The stock peaked at 230.25 in January 2005, dropped hard through the 10-week line and triggered a [defense-type sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-signal-weak-rebound-action-after-violating-the-50-day-line/). CME fell 29% in three months. CME broke out of a large [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) with a 220.59 buy point during the week ended June 3, 2005, and posted an amazing run. It rallied 214% by October 2007. A new base formed, a [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). CME broke out past the [correct entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 693.10 in early December that year.


The Peak
--------


The rally lasted all of three weeks. CME made a closing high of 710.75 in the week ended Dec. 21, 2007. But volume really dried up. On a weekly basis, 2.3 million shares exchanged hands, 23% below the 10-week average.


Over the next four weeks through January of 2008, CME dropped more than 24% off its peak of 714. By the end of 2008, the futures and options exchange traded at 208, 71% below its all-time high.

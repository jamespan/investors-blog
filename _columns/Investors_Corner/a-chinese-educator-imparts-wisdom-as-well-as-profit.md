Some stocks are better teachers than others. And it's maybe fitting that one of the most professorial recent leaders, with regard to the rules of the [CAN SLIM investing strategy](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), has been **New Oriental Education & Technology** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)).

The stock launched its uptrend in October 2015, rising 193% to an October 2016 high of 53.38 before carving into what would become a five month cup-with-handle base.

But first, let's review news on Dec. 2 that the American International Recruitment Council was investigating [incidences of academic fraud](https://www.investors.com/news/new-oriental-dives-on-investigation-into-academic-fraud-allegations/) alleged in a Dec. 2 Reuters report.
Shares tanked 14% in massive trade. The heavy-volume loss undercut the stock's 50-day line of support, sending one sell signal. The tumble also cut 13% below a flat base buy point of 45.47, triggering the [automatic sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) that says sell without question if a stock falls 7% to 8% below a buy point.

But there were also some positives in the sell-off.

First, the stock trimmed its losses to end the day nicely supported at its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-200-day-moving-average/). That helped establish the long-term support line as a foundation in the stock's basing effort.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wIC-033117-1024x574.png)The second positive in the Dec. 2 train wreck was that it undercut New Oriental's prior base, a flat base that formed from late July to September. This factor [reset the stock's base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).

That means, if the chart went on to establish a valid base, that base would be a first-stage pattern that unlocks increased potential for a renewed uptrend.

Another positive: Over the next four weeks the stock posted very tight weekly closes.

This is generally a [strong indicator of institutional support](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/tight-action-reveals-accumulation/), particularly when it occurs at a technically significant level such as the 200-day and 40-week moving averages.

The stock then jumped 13% at the start of the New Year, retaking its 10-week moving average in a five-day run up **(1)** that showed some flashes of above-average trade — also an indicator of institutional accumulation.

Despite the investigation into the company's handling of student applications and documentation to U.S. colleges, Jefferies, Credit Suisse, Brean Capital and Daiwa Capital Markets maintained buy or overweight ratings on the stock. Nomura upgraded the stock to buy from neutral Jan. 11, with a 58 price target.

New Oriental also offered lessons in how to buy breakouts. The stock first shaped a [three-week long handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) which held nice support at its 10-week moving average and offered a 51.79 buy point. Shares rose above that buy marker in weak-to-modest trade on Feb. 13 and 14. The moves did not generate [the minimum 40% increase](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-high-volume-on-breakout-is-one-key-to-biggest-stock-winners/) above average daily trading volume needed to confirm a breakout. Plus, volume rose in the prior week **(2)**, a positive sign of rising demand.

So, investors who bought at that 51.79 buy point would not have necessarily been shaken out. As a second handle formed, also three weeks long, the pullback in the new handle stretched to just 7% below the 51.79 buy point, avoiding the automatic sell requirement beyond 8%.

A second handle, also three weeks long, produced an alternative buy point of 52.47. New Oriental topped this buy point briefly, twice in weak trade, [then on a big energy boost on March 15](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/late-volume-can-lead-to-big-post-breakout-gains/). Volume surged again on March 20 and 21, helping lift shares to their March 24 high. On Friday, shares hit new highs, rising as much as 16% past the latest entry.

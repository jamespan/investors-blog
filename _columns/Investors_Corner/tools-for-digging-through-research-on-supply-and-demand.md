It snowed here last weekend, a big dust-up for the Washington, D.C., area. When stores reopened a day later, you couldn’t find a snow shovel anywhere at any price.


An enterprising buddy of mine who runs a small, local hardware store drove a few hours south Sunday morning, just beyond the deep snow zone. He filled his truck with 400 snow shovels, then high-tailed it back home.  At midday, he was the only guy in town with shovels.


Price was almost no object. Home Depot and Lowe’s had no shovels.  He is a reasonable guy -- not a gouger. But if he’d wanted, he easily could’ve doubled his prices.

As a business owner, or as a student in a basic macroeconomics course, you learn the basics of supply and demand. Supply is the available quantity of a product. Demand is how much consumers desire or need that product. The combination of the two tends to determine a product’s price.


That same principle holds true in stocks.


When there are many shares within a stock's float that shareholders are very willing to sell, and only modest demand, prices should fall. A tight supply of readily available shares and high or rising demand suggest that prices will increase.


The I in IBD's [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) investment model stands for Institutional Demand. "Institutional" means big investors: hedge funds, insurance companies, banks and mutual funds. They don’t just buy one or two shovels, or even 400. They buy tens of thousands, even millions of shares when they move into stocks. That buying can constrain the supply of available shares. When a stock is attractive, it places upward pressure on the stock’s price.


When supply constraints reach a critical stage vs. rising demand, the stock’s price often breaks out and charges higher. Buy points are essentially technical markers of where these critical stages are most likely to occur.


To aid investors in their basic research, IBD’s [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) provides a five-slice view into a stock’s supply/demand situation.


1. Market Capitalization: the bigger a stock, the less likely it is that one or two large funds will manipulate it. You’d like multiple funds setting up positions, buying shares and gradually tightening a stock’s supply. The larger the market capitalization, the better.


2. Accumulation/Distribution Rating: An A or B grade suggests funds or buying. A grade below C points to weak institutional demand.


3. Up/Down Volume:  Ratings above 1 indicate buying pressure to the upside. Ratings below 1 suggest that sellers are more in control.


4. Percentage Change In Funds Owning Stock: How many more funds owned shares in the most recent quarter vs. the prior quarter? High numbers are positives. Numbers above 25% are outstanding.


5. Quarters of Increasing Fund Ownership: How many consecutive quarters have funds collectively increased the total shares that they own?

In the stock market, timing is critical. If you buy the right stock at the wrong time, you most likely will get pain, not gain. To find the right time, use stock charts and learn to spot proper base patterns.

  

A base is an area of rest or consolidation after prior significant price gains. IBD's historical research shows that typical base patterns require a minimum number of weeks to form. One, two or three weeks do not get the job done.

  

Using the guidelines below will help keep you focused on the best opportunities and away from riskier setups.

  

Start by focusing on the bread and butter cup-with-handle, double-bottom and flat-base patterns. These are the most common patterns that repeat in every market cycle.

  

**Study A Weekly Chart**

  

In a weekly chart, look for periods of sideways movement or mild declines following a prior uptrend of at least 30% in price. Count the weeks in the base starting with the first week that closes down through the week prior to the breakout.

  

[Cup-with-handle patterns](http://education.investors.com/) are shaped like the silhouette of a tea cup viewed from the side. They range from seven weeks to as long as 65 weeks in length, with many forming over three to six months.

  

Double bottoms must also be at least seven weeks in length. These patterns are shaped like a tilted letter W where the second low undercuts the first.

  

Flat bases are tight, shallow patterns that can form more quickly. Still, look for consolidation areas that are at least five weeks long and fall no more than 10% to 15%.

  

Among rarer patterns, count the ascending base and high-tight flag. While not seen as frequently, and more difficult to spot and interpret, these patterns are still well worth learning because of the potential for explosive gains.

  

Ascending bases are shaped by three pullbacks with higher highs and higher lows over a nine- to 16-week span. They can be difficult to spot since the stock is actually trending higher during the base.

  

High-tight flag patterns consist of two parts, the flagpole and flag. The flagpole is shaped by a rapid run-up of 100% to 120% in only four to eight weeks. The flag then forms with three to five weeks of tight sideways trading.

  

Proper base patterns show that eager sellers are now out of the stock. Bases also set the stage for a stock's next advance. Many of the best ones often form during corrections when the overall market is weak.

  

Study examples of successful bases to train your eye to know what to look for. In "How to Make Money in Stocks," William O'Neil wrote, "Price patterns of the great stocks of the past can clearly serve as models for your future selections."

  

With that in mind, let's take a look at a winning cup-with-handle pattern shaped by **EMC** ([EMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMC)) in early 1993. It was a 12-week base starting with the week ended Jan. 29 1 through the week ended April 16 2, the week prior to the breakout. The stock corrected 29% and had a classic shape.

  

The basing period was a three-month pause that set the stock up for a strong run. Shares broke out on April 22 in big volume at 26.48 (the chart shows prices adjusted for two 2-for-1 splits) and ran up 193% in just 26 weeks.

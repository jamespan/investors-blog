Some folks on Wall Street and Main Street think certain patterns found in market behavior and growth stocks simply cannot last. The reasoning? Once everyone knows about such patterns, they break down.

That's certainly the case when a hot company slams Wall Street earnings-per-share estimates quarter after quarter after quarter. At some point, analysts' expectations go through the roof. Then the stock plunges by simply meeting or barely beating the consensus EPS forecast.

Investor sentiment indicators can become less useful. Some [secondary market indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) can help investors get a contrarian sense that a major turn is approaching. Other measures grow stale. But what does not change? Greed, fear, hope, despair and everything else in between. These human emotions drive activity. They make the careful study of [stock charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), plus the knowledge and application of bullish chart patterns, invaluable to investors.

## When To Buy Growth Stocks: Planet Fitness Stock

**Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), an August 2015 IPO, proves this point with its strong price run in recent years. Its [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), one of eight VIPs (very important patterns) that investors in growth stocks can master, set up a solid rally that began in February 2018.

The stock's daily and weekly chart patterns showed the same bullish elements that former big winner and cellphone pioneer Nokia displayed in a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) base formed in 1998. Nokia delivered magnificent gains near the end of the 1990s bull run.

Look inside "How To Make Money In Stocks," by IBD founder William O'Neil, and you'll find more examples of the double bottom in the 1990s (with data storage giant EMC and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO))) and even the 1970s (with Dome Petroleum).

The double bottom looks sort of like the letter "W." It features two distinct sell-offs. After hitting a low point, the stock will rally back near its 52-week high, then stumble and fall again. The second low should undercut the first low — even by a penny. Why? You want the market to do a really good job of flushing out the weak shareholders. They surrender shares to others who have strong conviction in the company.

After the second sell-off, the stock finds its footing again. If the company is a true industry leader, has excellent fundamentals, and shows signs of share accumulation by top-rated mutual funds, it has a good chance of breaking out when equities turn higher.

## How The Double Bottom Forms

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ICplnt101518-300x161.jpg)Planet Fitness made two lows within its eight-week double bottom, 31.78 and 28.98. In other words, the second sell-off made a healthy undercut of the first low. The budget-friendly gym chain fell just 17% from the top of the base to the low. In general, deep corrections of 40% or more greatly hurt the chances of a successful base.

The middle peak within the base, 34.99 in late January, came within 4 cents of the left-side peak. Add 10 cents to the middle peak's high to find the breakout point: 35.09.

The stock cleared that buy point with a superb breakout on Feb. 23, gapping up at the open and rising more than 12% by day's end. Volume surged **(1)**. The catalyst? Nice quarterly numbers. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 rose 20% to 24 cents a share, extending a streak of solid year-over-year growth to eight quarters. Revenue rose 15%.

Since then, earnings per share have accelerated 42% and 55% on top-line gains of 33% and 31%.

By May 2019, the stock reached as high as 81.90, up 133%.

Not a bad gain over a 15-month period.

Today, the stock is trying to bottom out and finish the right side of a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). For now, it appears to be working on a [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).

Will it latch a [handle on to that cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/)? Or, will the pattern turn into a double bottom? Keep watching it week to week.

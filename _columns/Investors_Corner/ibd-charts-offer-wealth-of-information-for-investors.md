Some readers no doubt miss turning the pages of IBD's newspaper each day, but in many ways, the Investors.com website makes it easier to evaluate stocks quickly and efficiently.

Take, for example, the [IBD Charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) feature, found under the Research tab at Investors.com.

Clicking on the entry brings up a chart of the Nasdaq that allows readers to view the daily, weekly or intraday action of the index. Below the chart is a Market Analysis section that indicates the market's status -- that is, whether the market stands in a confirmed uptrend, an uptrend under pressure or a correction.

The charts of other indexes or stocks can be viewed by entering their respective tickers in the search field.

Let's look at telecommunications play **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), which recently rose into a profit-taking zone by climbing more than 20% above a 73.28 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It's also trying to hold above a second handle buy point at 86.14.

The top of the chart provides an overview of information that helps investors evaluate a stock's quality, including market capitalization, average daily volume and how far the stock is trading off its 52-week high. It also shows the stock's Earnings Per Share Rating, which in Dycom's case is a stellar 98 out of 99.
Next to the EPS Rating tab is a series of buttons that allow you to print out the chart, to link to the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-dycom-inds-inc-dy.aspx) and to link to [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com), an IBD sister charting-and-custom-screening service that provides more detailed fundamental, technical and fund sponsorship information to help you evaluate the stock's health.

Dycom's chart identifies it as a [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) stock. Leaderboard helps users quickly identify a key market leader's buy point, and charts of companies featured on Leaderboard contain notations written by market writers in real time about current bases, buy and sell points, and notable instances of stock strength and weakness.

A great advantage of the charts at Investors.com is that they're easier to read -- they're larger than the mini-charts found in the newspaper, and they're always in color -- with up days in price shown in blue, and down days in red.  The 50- and 200-day moving averages and the Relative Price Strength line -- which rises if a stock is beating the S&P 500 -- are also easier to see.

Clicking at each point on the chart opens a box that contains details on each day's (or week's) price and volume movements and the stock's relationship to its key support lines.

Just below the chart is a box showing the stock's Composite Rating (Dycom's is 99) and indicating whether the stock is a leader in its industry group. Go below that to see archived stories from both IBD and media partners, such as Zacks Equity Research and TheStreet.com, to do further research on the company.

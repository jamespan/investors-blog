Latching on to a top-notch growth stock in the early stages of a [confirmed stock market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) can be a highly profitable endeavor. While powerful IBD growth stock screens like the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) can help you find them, consider also using the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). It too has proven its power in uncovering emerging stock market leaders quickly.




The screen is updated just after the market open, giving an early look at the session's movers and shakers. It's continually updated with real-time price data. And you can click any column header to sort the screen as you like.


Focus On Growth Stocks
----------------------


Sort by price-percentage change to see who the early big movers are. Or you can sort by "Volume % Change Vs. 50-Day" to see which stocks are rising due to strong institutional buying demand â€” or falling as big investors unwind positions.


A sort by average daily dollar volume will uncover the most liquid, institutional-quality growth stocks. In general, focus on stocks with average daily dollar volume of at least \$25 million.


Meanwhile, a sort by [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) delivers high-quality stocks with a healthy blend of strong fundamentals and leading price performance.


The MarketSmith Growth 250 is a fantastic way to home in on stocks [building bases](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/), [breaking out of bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) or [clearing alternate entry points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/). Alternate entries come in the form of a first or second successful test of the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), or a breakout from a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/).

Early-Stage Breakout For CyberArk
---------------------------------


The MarketSmith Growth 250 yielded a big mover on July 15 when **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)) broke out of a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with a 138.83 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). A quick sort by "Volume % Change" put CyberArk near the top of the results.


Heavy-volume breakout aren't easy to find during the summer doldrums, but CyberArk delivered one and closed near its session high. Despite a strong move higher in recent months, CyberArk's latest breakout was from a [second-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/). However, the gains did not last long; at the end of July, CyberArk surrendered all of its 7% gain from the pivot point as the general market cooled off quickly in late July to mid-August.



On Aug. 5, CyberArk plunged below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. That negative action delivered a [timely sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


Meanwhile, a recent screen of stocks with [relative strength lines at new highs](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-how-to-find-big-stock-market-winners-blue-dot-list-marketsmith/) delivered **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) when it was breaking out of a base with a 218.38 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). **Global Payments** ([GPN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPN)) also made the screen when it cleared a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) with a 172.30 [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

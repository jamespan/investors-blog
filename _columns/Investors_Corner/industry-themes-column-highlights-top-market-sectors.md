**How To Profit From MAKING MONEY:** [Tenth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/603354/201203061545/how-to-profit-from-ibds-making-money-.aspx)

Dolphins and tuna. You wouldn't mistake one for the other. Yet they do have a lot in common.

They swim fast. They thrive in saltwater. They travel in groups. And they enrich our lives.

Think of leading stocks in the same manner. Some big movers hail from the same industry, such as restaurants or semiconductors. They may battle head to head in the marketplace. Or they might serve discrete markets.

Two restaurant stocks — or three — can all become highly profitable investments in part because the entire industry is hot. If profits and sales are rising at a fast clip, you can expect a whale of buying among the big investors in the market.

Use the [IBD Industry Themes](<https://www.investors.com/search/searchresults.aspx?source=filterSearch&Ntt=IBD+Industry+Themes&Nr=OR(Column%3aIBD+Industry+Themes%2cEducation%2fHelp+Type%3aIBD+Industry+Themes)>) column as a compass to locate these top industries and the stocks leading them.

Speaking of industries, there's good reason why IBD slices and dices the stock market into 197 separate groups. The paper's research has found that up to nearly half of a big stock's move can be linked to the strength of its individual industry and broad sector.

The column tracks the broad movements within the table too.

In the Nov. 21, 2011, column, IBD highlighted **Hibbett Sports** ([HIBB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HIBB)), a Birmingham, Ala.-based company that has taken Wal-Mart's small-town strategy into the sporting goods business.

The column noted that in the July-ended fiscal second quarter, Hibbett grew earnings per share 50% on a 10% sales increase. That 50% jump followed a 250% EPS increase in the year-ago-quarter.

At the time of this feature, Hibbett was on pace for a second straight weekly decline 1. But volume shrank, and the stock held above the 10-week moving average 2. The stock was simply pulling back after trying to clear a shaky, four-month cuplike base 3.

Hibbett's chart improved the next month just as the market firmed up. Weeks of tight closes led to a new breakout from a four-week square box at 47.32 4. Weekly volume rose, a good sign. The stock has since rallied more than 10%.

**Dick's Sporting Goods** ([DKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKS)), **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)), also mentioned in the Nov. 21 column, have also led the current rally.

Bigger is better, right? Wrong.

  

If you're a small investor working with just a few thousand dollars, or even a few million, you might think you're behind the eight ball.

  

After all, IBD consistently points out that institutions — banks, mutual funds, advisers and the like — rule the market.

  

But here's the reality. In day-to-day market operations, those other guys are behind the eight ball. Think of what they have to do in order to take a full-size position in a stock. They can't just place an order to buy 3 million shares of **Ancestry.com** ([ACOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACOM)) at the market. That's 7% of the float.

  

Imagine what that would do to the stock. Yes, it would surely go flying, but that one big buyer would simply be bidding against himself. And once he was done, the stock would quickly fall back to earth.

  

Okay, so you don't have to put all of your billion-dollar fund into any one stock. Instead, you can put \$10 million into each of 100 different stocks. That way, you won't disrupt the market nearly as much as you build your positions.

  

You will see that many of the best fund managers do exactly that. They limit their exposure to any single stock to, say, 5%. The average exposure typically is much lower than that. This, of course, is good money-management practice for a number of reasons.

  

But here's the downside: You need a bigger menu of stocks to fill your portfolio. While your holdings may be limited to less than 10 stocks, a billion-dollar fund may have dozens, scores — or even hundreds — of different issues.

  

Is that a problem? You bet it is.

  

Those five or six or seven stocks that you own are among the best in the market, assuming that you've done your homework.

  

What if you suddenly had to add another 93 stocks? You'd have to go down the ladder of quality, lowering your standards until you can fill your bigger basket.

  

The same problem arises when it's time to exit quickly. Even a \$10 million portfolio can be liquidated with a few mouse clicks. But the big-fund manager with 100 stocks to worry about needs at least weeks to unwind.

  

When it comes time to re-enter the market on a strong follow-through, you'll be ready to pounce while the elephants in the room may still be in limbo.

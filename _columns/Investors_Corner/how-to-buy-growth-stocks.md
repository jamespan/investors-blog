The mini-charts found on IBD's Stock Spotlight page help disciplined readers spot new buy points or elements of superior strength. But it's also beneficial to look at a longer chart. **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) is an excellent case in point.

  

The designer of chips used in servers, telecom infrastructure and data storage systems is up more than 20% year-to-date, crushing both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. The mini-chart in the above screen not only illustrates this positive action, but it also highlights the seemingly countless times that Mellanox pulled back to its 10-week moving average (the black line running along with the weekly price bars), found buying support, then resumed its upward climb.

  

So why look at a longer weekly chart that covers, say, three years or longer? You'll see that the stock's landscape changes dramatically. Mellanox is still more than 55% below its all-time peak of 120.05.

  

In other words, the stock is in the middle of a [gigantic cup](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/740868-how-to-invest-in-stocks.htm).

  

When a stock has fallen that much, investors can still buy it if it does at least four things: 1) rise sharply in price in heavy weekly trade; 2) form a valid base so that it can break out to 52-week highs; 3) continue to post strong fundamentals; and 4) meet all of the parameters of IBD's [CAN SLIM investment model](http://education.investors.com/).

  

As noted in the chart analysis below the mini-chart, Mellanox has climbed past a three-weeks-tight follow-on entry at 51.33. From October to January, the stock fashioned a flat base with a 47.06 buy point. It's struggled to make much headway, but the general trend is higher for now. Another attempt to move past resistance near 49 took place on April 21-23, but the stock quickly pulled back.

  

Israel-based Mellanox's fundamentals are recovering. Earnings per share were flat in Q3 2014, then jumped 181% and 445% in the latest two quarters on revenue increases of 34% (to \$141.1 million) and 48% (\$146.7 million).

  

Mellanox's [SMR Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) is positive at B.

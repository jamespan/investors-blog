The back burner is an unusually important implement for investors.


Back-burner projects, for many folks, are those that tend to get put off and eventually delayed into oblivion. But stocks often get back-burnered on investor watch lists simply because they are not quite ready for prime time. Checking in on these from time to time can be a lucrative exercise.


One type of chart pattern that demands back-burner-type attention is the saucer base.


Saucers are generally longer and shallower than are cup bases. They usually correct 12% to 30%. They can be as short as seven weeks, but tend to be much longer, often a year or more.


The stocks, usually big-cap stocks, look like they're wallowing, tracking sideways. The companies are often restructuring or executing strategies leading toward a turnaround.


Keeping a back-burner eye on the progress of earnings, sales, margins and debt and looking at upcoming estimates are a crucial part of the process.


Keep in mind, with big-cap stocks, fundamentals often improve at a slower rate than smaller growth stocks.


But, over time, if fundamentals are improving and that improvement is not yet reflected in a rising stock price, valuation pressure could be building.


Buy points for saucer bases work the same way as on [cups](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/689140-the-cup-with-handle.htm). Plot them off the base's left-side high, plus a dime. Yes, saucers can build handles, to which all the same validating rules apply as in a cup base.


Iconic athletic brand **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) popped out of a saucer-with-handle base on March 22 last year, right after reporting its fiscal third-quarter results. Earnings growth accelerated to 20%, the best increase in six quarters and a second month of growth after two quarterly declines. Sales growth was steady at 9%.


At the time of the breakout, the stock held an 87 EPS Rating. Its Relative Strength was relatively weak at 51 â€” a common side effect of the long, lagging saucers. An eight-week handle formed starting late in January. The stock cleared the 56 buy point with an 11% gap-up gain in huge trade.


Nike rose 43% before beginning its current consolidation in December.

Price and volume bars are the nuts and bolts of a stock's chart, helping readers find a strong stock that shows the potential to break out and be a winner.


Every Wednesday, IBD publishes weekly charts accompanying the IBD 50, a list of top high-growth stocks. The price and volume bars in these charts are color-coded to help readers assess the health of a stock's base.


Blue price and volume bars show a stock has risen from the previous day; red bars mean the stock has fallen. The color scheme helps investors quickly assess a stock's direction. The hash mark in each bar shows where the stock closed during the week.


These enhancements make it easy to see unusually heavy — or light — buying and selling. All charts on Investors.com are built this way. Stocks that move up in heavy volume are being bought by deep-pocketed institutional investors; they ultimately control the stock's destiny. Conversely, stocks that sell off in heavy trade are being sold hard by big funds.


Let's look at teen clothing retailer **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)), which formed a double-bottom base in late 2005. The base added a handle with a buy point at 17, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split in April 2006.


The left side of the pattern shows three straight red down weeks — typical of a stock forming the left side of a base. What's important is that the stock shows more accumulation (blue up weeks in above-average volume) than distribution (red down weeks in above-average volume).


Although the second bottom of the double-bottom pattern shows a red volume spike, the stock finished in the upper half of its weekly trading range, indicating support. The handle formed in desirably light volume — see the fading red volume bars leading up to the breakout.


Zumiez cleared its buy point in the week ended Nov. 4 in volume that was 24% above normal, less than the 40% jump you'd like to see. But weekly turnover was above average **1**, then picked up sharply in the following week, as shown by a blue volume spike **2**.


Zumiez enjoyed a strong run up its 10-week line, with the number of blue up weeks in above-average volume far outnumbering red down weeks. The stock went on to more than double to a record high of 38.85 in July 2006.


It showed signs of distress in the weeks before its peak, as indicated by a big, red volume spike accompanying the stock's plunge below its 10-week line in the week ended May 19, 2006.


To determine whether demand for a stock is rising or falling, check both the stock's daily and weekly action. The daily chart gives you a more immediate picture; the weekly chart offers a longer-term perspective.


Stocks in Wednesday's IBD 50 that have been showing strong price and volume action in recent weeks include top-ranked **Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)), **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) and 12th-ranked **Manhattan Associates** ([MANH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MANH)).

Averaging up and averaging down are two terms often heard but not well understood by beginning investors.


Averaging up is what happens when you add to a position in a rising stock. Every time you make a new purchase, the cost of the new shares is higher than the last purchase price. This drives up the average cost of your position -- the total investment averaged across all of your accumulated shares.


Averaging down is the opposite: buying a declining stock. Each new purchase costs less, so the average cost declines.


Investors buy on declines when they are convinced that a stock will recover to or above its current levels. It is a slightly distorted way to look at the buy low/sell high axiom: "Every time I average down, my cost basis goes lower, so my ability to profit is increased."


The missing proof, required in the [CAN SLIM investing technique](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749), is heavy institutional interest. Declining stocks typically show funds and other big investors shipping out. On a stock’s chart, this shows as distribution, or declines in high trading volume.


Until a stock’s chart begins to show evidence of accumulation -- days of increasing prices in heavy trade as big investors move in and establish positions -- an individual investor’s belief in the stock's story, or confidence in the historical trends of a stock or industry, is purely a gamble.


Averaging up is the smart stock investor's strategy for grafting onto strong price moves driven by institutional support. Bases show a turnover in institutional holders: distribution on the left side, accumulation on the right. Breakouts past buy points occur after accumulation by big money buyers constrains the supply of available shares.


Investors who step in at this point are in a solid position to begin averaging up.

The concept grates the nerves of investors trained to seek out bargains. Rather than buy low and sell high, the [IBD approach](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735787) says buy at a proper breakout point, not at a low, then add and add and, finally, sell the entire position higher.


When the approach doesn’t work, you sell your original position at 7% to 8% and never book a deeper loss.


In a seriously rallying stock, the add-on buys and the averaging up (as well as the profits) can go on for years.


So, how much averaging up is acceptable?


![ICch-REGN-042016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ICch-REGN-042016.jpg)Look at **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals**’ ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) breakout in January 2012. Let’s say an investor placed a \$10,000 position on the stock at the breakout. (You could do this in steps at the breakout, through a technique called [pyramiding](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-pyramid-into-top-stocks/).)


You could add to that position with smaller, measured buys in:


1) February 2012, at a three-weeks-tight pattern **(1)** with a 117.03 buy point (an earlier entry near 110 was justifiable).


2) August 2012, at the breakout **(2)** from 142.06 a cup-with-handle buy point.


3) April 2013, at the breakout **(3)** from a 176.47 cup-with-handle buy point.


4) February 2014, at the breakout above a 319.93 cup-base buy point.


5) March 2015, at the breakout above a flat base buy point of 437.74.

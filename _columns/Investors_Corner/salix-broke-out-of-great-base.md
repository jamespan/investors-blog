It's not enough for a stock to have strong sales and profit growth. It should have a nice-looking chart.

  

Charts help investors identify the proper buy point for stocks that meet IBD's strict fundamental criteria. IBD research has shown that the best stocks of the past 100 years have broken out of correctly shaped bases.

  

No matter what the base pattern, it should show tight trading with mild volume. Stocks that feature a large number of weekly price swings of more than 10% tend to look ragged, suggesting a flawed pattern.

  

Big price swings are a danger sign because they suggest that the stock has fallen out of favor with big investors, who have started to sell even if the stock may still have strong fundamentals.

  

By contrast, tight weekly closes in normal volume and smooth overall price action indicate that funds are buying as others sell. These funds tend to build positions gradually to reduce risk and avoid the wild swings that would occur if they traded large amounts of shares at once.

  

A few weeks of wide swings aren't necessarily bad, especially if they occur as the stock corrects to form a new base. A stock that shows volatile action but closes in the upper half of its weekly trading range is likely being supported by institutional investors. Big funds also tend to buy a strong stock when it tests its 50-day and 10-week moving averages.

  

**Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) shaped a smooth cup-with-handle base starting in early July 2012. The base was a less risky first-stage pattern and resembled a shallow coffee cup. It featured an orderly price decline on the left side and a similarly smooth climb on the right.

  

A plunge of more than 15% in the week ended Aug. 3, 2012, was where you'd expect it â€” early on the left side of the base.

  

Overall, the pattern featured tight trading for all but about three weeks. The correction in the cup was 33%. Then Salix got a nice rebound above its 10-week line in January 2013 **(1)**, launching eight straight weekly gains.

  

Salix added a handle to the yearlong pattern starting in early April 2013. Salix's handle shows a bit of a shakeout, though overall it features mild weekly declines in tight trading.

  

The stock cleared the 51.94 buy point in the week ended May 3, 2013, launching another streak of eight up weeks in a row. It rose 46% in three months.

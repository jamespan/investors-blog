The classics in any field — cars, films, music — are a thing of beauty. But they all share a common trait: They are good teachers. Even if you've seen one a hundred times, there's always more to learn.

  

In the world of chart bases, the true classic is the cup-with-handle base. It is the most common base type. Structurally, it may also be the most sturdy. In a market uptrend, this pattern typically leads to breakouts and big gains.

  

A cup with handle must be at least seven weeks long, but can take a year or more to form. Most often, good cup patterns are three to six months in length.

  

A good example was the base started by **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) in May 2010. The base followed the rules, staging a run-up of at least 30% before it got started **1**.

  

The depth of the cup was also correct, falling well within the 15% to 33% range **2**. Corrections deeper than this may still work. But the breakouts they produce carry an added dose of risk.

  

Herbalife's cup wasn't as smooth as you might have liked, but it did gather weeks of accumulation as it climbed from its low point.

  

A proper handle is at least five days in length. They should slant lower. The handle also should form in the upper part of the entire base.

  

Handles can be many weeks in length, and often form in proportion to the length of the cup.

  

Add a dime to the handle's peak to determine the correct buy point. A breakout occurs when the stock clears that mark in at least a 40% increase in volume vs. its daily average.

  

Herbalife formed a slightly low handle beginning June 21 **3**. Despite that, Herbalife shares cleared that handle, just barely, on July 15 in a surge of volume 46% above its average pace.

  

Investors hesitating to buy because of the slightly low handle saw another handle take shape. Herbalife cleared that handle in weak volume, however **4**.

  

The stock pulled back yet again. This time, it shaped a convincing handle. Volume behaved for the most part, drying up through most of the handle, shaking out those last few uncertain shareholders.

  

Herbalife rocked out of that handle with a 12% price gain on trading more than 500% above average — it was a classic breakout from a well-formed base **5**.

  

Since then, Herbalife shares have more than doubled in price.

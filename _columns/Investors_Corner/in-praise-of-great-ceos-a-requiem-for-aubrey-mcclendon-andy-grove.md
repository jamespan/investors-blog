One man revolutionized the way companies explore for crude oil and natural gas in the 21st century. Another man set a Silicon Valley chipmaking juggernaut on a new path during the 1980s and 1990s, leading to more powerful personal computers, big profits and huge shareholder returns.


While the 2016 presidential election drama and its leading characters -- Hillary, Bernie, Ted and The Donald -- still capture the public's attention, today's column salutes Aubrey McClendon of **Chesapeake Energy** ([CHK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHK)) and **Intel**'s ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) Andy Grove.


These CEOs have perhaps made as big an impact on American life as any U.S. president, past or future.


What can we learn from the McClendons and Groves of the world?


If you seek to grow your wealth with the help of excellent stocks, pay plenty of attention to the character, skills, experience, vision and decisions by a company's CEO. Many are good, but some are awesome. And hopefully the next president won't wreck America's free enterprise system, and there will be a new Aubrey, Andy or Steve Jobs.


At the same time, don't get too overly swept up by the CEO's magic, charm or long years of success.


At some point, as an investor, you must have an exit strategy in mind. Even if you bought a great stock at the first breakout and amass big paper gains, those gains are only on paper. Analyzing the stock's chart action and [selling](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735788) at least portions of your position [on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/dont-led-greed-dictate-investment-decisions/) enable you to keep those excellent hard-earned gains.

McClendon, a co-founder of Chesapeake Energy, was one of the biggest proponents of fracking. His passion was extreme. McClendon rode a motorbike powered by natural gas and wore ties that showed miniature drilling rigs, Bloomberg Businessweek reported this month.


He also showed Wall Street and the world that the U.S. had a lot more oil and natural gas that were more accessible than anyone could have imagined. Peak oil? Baloney. By perfecting the techniques of hydraulic fracturing of shale formations and horizontal drilling, Chesapeake and a slew of other U.S. companies helped turn America from a net importer of natural gas into a net exporter.


In May 2003, Chesapeake shares blasted out of a giant cup with handle at 8.74. It immediately crossed into double-digit share prices, rallied 31% in just six weeks, then set up another base, this time over 10 a share. Chesapeake eventually raced 747% higher to a high of 74 in early July 2008.![ICcht-032816](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ICcht-032816.jpg)


Then the stock plunged. Right after that peak, Chesapeake lost nearly 30% in three weeks. It burned right through the 10-week moving average in heavy volume -- a sell signal **(1)**.


Today, Chesapeake trades below 5 a share. McClendon died in a solo car crash on March 2 of this year, one day after the Department of Justice filed criminal charges against the 56-year-old, alleging he and an unnamed company conspired to avoid bidding against each other on drilling leases in his home state of Oklahoma from 2007 to 2012.


Grove, meanwhile, joined Intel in 1968 as employee No. 3. He rose to become president in 1979 and CEO in 1987. Grove is perhaps best known for moving the company away from memory chips. Asian manufacturers barged their way in with quality semiconductors, driving down prices. The intense price competition convinced Grove, author of "Only the Paranoid Survive," to exit that business and venture into microprocessors.


The 180-degree turn paid off in spades. "Intel Inside" became a mantra of the PC revolution. From January 1990 to its peak in August 2000 at 75.81, Intel shares surged 6,919%, breaking out of multiple bases over that time frame. Grove passed away on March 21.

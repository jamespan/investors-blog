The Golden State and the Lone Star State have a tight lasso on a large chunk of the newest companies now trading on America’s stock exchanges. The past two Investor’s Corner [columns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/california-leads-nation-in-tech-lifesciences-ipos/) demonstrated that.


But these two states do not hold a monopoly.


Newer companies that are posting above-average growth rates in earnings and sales are popping up in states such as Pennsylvania, Illinois and Massachusetts. Arizona and North Carolina are also key contributors.

IBD ran a screen for companies that went public no later than Jan. 1, 2010, then weeded out those trading below 10 a share and holding a daily average volume of less than 250,000 shares. A total of 245 made the cut. And as the table shows, not all of them are from California or Texas. The lesson? Keep your eyes wide open for exciting new stores or services in your town or a familiar city. If there are big crowds, check and see if the company is publicly traded. Newer stocks fuel new bull markets.


William O’Neil shopped at Price Club in San Diego decades ago. The IBD founder and chairman has told many an audience that he was astounded by the long lines at the cash registers and the unique warehouse-style environment, complete with super-low prices.


O’Neil says he began buying shares in the Price Club chain operator Price Co. when there were just two stores. Price Co., under the retailing wizardry of founder Sol Price and his associates, went on to become **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)), a mega-giant in retailing with a \$66 billion market cap. The profits from O’Neil’s investment in Price Co. helped him establish IBD in 1984.


IBD's stock research tables begin in Wednesday's paper on Page B6. Companies that went public within the past 15 years and hold EPS and RS Ratings of 80 or higher are bunched together at the top of each sector listing.

Buying a highly rated stock again at the right moment, after you've lost money on it the first time, can be a true mental and psychological challenge. But it can prove the key difference between a middling year of performance and a stellar one.


Let's look at November 2016, when the market's prospects were looking bleak. Many leading tech stocks were breaking down and triggering downside sell signals — such as falling below the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) or breaking through the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) in massive volume.


But over the next several months, these same leaders would [build proper bases](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/), break out, and move significantly higher. Their fundamentals remained stellar. All it took was the courage to step up and buy them at their proper entries.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ICfb061917-300x162.png)Throughout January and February of this year, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) and Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) all broke out of [classic chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) on their way to record highs and substantial gains.


On Oct. 21, Facebook broke out of a narrow flat base with a 132.08 entry, 10 cents above the Sept. 7, 2016, intraday high. Nine days later, investors were hit with a key sell signal — down 7% from the buy point. Investors that followed the rules avoided about 7% more downside and over two months of dead money.


The social media giant went on to build a cup with handle with a 129.37 buy point. The breakout came on Jan. 24, but volume was well below the 40%-50% IBD standard. Prudent investors could have waited for a surge in volume before committing their capital, which would finally come on Feb. 22 as the stock broke through resistance around 135.


Over the coming months, the market leader would rise almost 19% from its buy point. Facebook is currently fighting to gain support at its 10-week line for a third time in as many months.


 Alibaba broke out of a cup with handle with a 104.67 buy point on Feb. 22. Patience was imperative as the Chinese e-commerce giant's progress was slow but steady. Gains started to accelerate in mid-April as the stock exceeded a 110.55 three-weeks-tight add-on entry. On June 9, shares reached over 41% from the buy point. Investors with high levels of conviction in the fundamental story could decide to monitor the stock and hold for even more gains, though taking profits would certainly be appropriate.
 Search giant Alphabet exceeded an 824.40 entry in flat volume on Jan. 6, jump-starting a move that had mostly been languishing for over a year. Investors were tested on two separate occasions when the stock pulled back sharply around its buy point — once in early February and again in late March.
But the stock never triggered any outright sell signals. Patient investors were rewarded with gains exceeding 20% when the stock claimed the 1,000 price level. The stock has rebounded strongly from last week's tech sell-off and is about 3% off its record high.


While it can be difficult to risk your hard-earned capital on a stock that has burned you once, it can hurt even more to miss out on a big move to the upside. It's important to own a stock that is giving you the right signals.

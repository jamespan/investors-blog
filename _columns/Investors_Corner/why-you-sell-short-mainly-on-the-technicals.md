"Buy on fundamentals and technicals, but sell on technicals alone.”

You might have heard that expression at an [IBD workshop](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing/) on investing principles or at a Meetup group event.

The saying carries a heavy degree of significance in short selling as well. Numerous books have noted how some accomplished short sellers take a magnifying glass to a company’s financial statements and operations, discover fraud, sell the stock short, then wait for a profit as more investors catch on.

IBD’s strategy? Focus on the chart action (i.e., the "technicals") of a former big winner and determine if the bias among large investors -- mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, banks -- have switched from enthusiastic buying to anxious selling.

When these players have become big sellers, the reasons may already have a lot to do with the fundamentals.

An institutional investor will eventually lose confidence that a company will continue to smash Wall Street’s estimates on earnings and sales. Perhaps the forecasts themselves have gotten overly optimistic.

Because high-growth stocks tend to show above-average price-to-earnings ratios, they tend to fall fast on even the slightest disappointment in quarterly sales, profits, margins or forecasts for these numbers in the current or next quarter.

As noted in Investor’s Corner columns at the start of this year, make sure you are only targeting stocks that have made huge runs of 300% to 400% or more in price. Make sure they are highly liquid.

Also, grow familiar with the head-and-shoulders pattern, as well as the price-and-volume action of a former market winner that breaks out of a flawed late-stage base, then quickly triggers sell signals such as the 8% stop-loss rule.

Timberland enjoyed a hefty run from its October 1998 low of 7.02 (adjusted for two 2-for-1 splits) to a high of 74.25 in January 2001.

The boot maker’s fundamentals justified the gains: Net sales ballooned from \$690 million in 1996 to \$1.09 billion in 2000. Profits zoomed 536% over that period, from 45 cents a share to \$2.86.

Yet as the broader market topped, so did Timberland. The stock built a six-month head-and-shoulders pattern that featured at least three touches of the falling 10-week moving average.

In the week ended May 25, 2001, a short sale near 48.69 as Timberland swung back below the 10-week moving average produced a 25% gain just three weeks later. The stock's lofty 96 EPS Rating and SMR grade of A did not matter.

By September, Timberland slid 65% below its 74.25 peak as its top and bottom lines stumbled. It was acquired by **VFC Corp.** ([VFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VFC)) in 2011.

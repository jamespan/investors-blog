When shares of **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) topped last year, some chart readers perhaps weren't so surprised.

  

The stock, which had been a major market leader, displayed several classic signs of a peak.

  

The first problem with Lululemon was its own success. By 2013, the stock had skyrocketed more than 3,600% from its depths in 2009. Along the way, as the stock made 52-week and all-time highs, it formed several bases.

  

A long consolidation that started in May 2012 was a fifth-stage base. It made the stock inherently risky.

  

Most leading stocks make a major top after their third- or fourth-stage base, let alone a fifth-stage pattern.

  

Little wonder, then, that Lululemon's breakout past 78.06 in May 2013 went nearly nowhere for weeks after scoring all-time highs in the week ended May 10 **(1)**, a negative sign.

  

Shares of the yoga and workout apparel company plunged June 11 **(2)** (please see a daily chart), after the company reported quarterly earnings that were flat, hurt by a recall of too-thin yoga pants.

  

The plunge marked a sharp slowdown in earnings growth, which had been climbing down steadily for a few years. When a company's earnings go from triple-digit growth to 50% to 75% gains to 0% as Lululemon's did, it's a dramatic dropoff that investors should view as a sell signal.

  

The same day that the earnings came out, Lululemon said that Chief Executive Christine Day would step down as soon as the company found a replacement. The news rattled Lululemon investors.

  

The June sell-off drew the highest weekly volume in the stock's entire advance, which made for another sell signal **(3)**.

  

As seen on the weekly chart, Lululemon plummeted below both its 10-week and 40-week moving averages. On a daily chart as well, a serious break of the 50-day line in big volume is enough to trigger a sell signal, and in this case, the stock also violated its long-term 200-day average.

  

This situation indicated that institutional investors were not looking to add shares on a pullback. The rout was on.

  

Over the next few months, Lululemon made a partial recovery. But sellers came back in force in December and again in January, when the company's outlook dimmed each time.

  

The stock today trades more than 40% off its prior high, having never recovered from the collapse of June 2013.

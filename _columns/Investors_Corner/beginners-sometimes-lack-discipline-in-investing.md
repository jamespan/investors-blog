The stock market is no place for the undisciplined.

Investors who operate without trading rules can expect nothing more than serendipitous profits.

Novice investors who want to succeed will find that investing discipline runs the gamut from screening for good stocks, to evaluating them, to ultimately buying and selling them at the proper time and price.

So, here's a beginner's guide to getting the right discipline throughout the process.

**Be disciplined**

First, focus your efforts on screens of the best stocks, principally the IBD 50, Your Weekly Review, Sector Leaders and Stock Spotlight.

Sector Leaders (today on Page B7 and discussed in the [Smart Table Review](http://news.investors.com/investing-smart-table-review/011414-686347-leading-stock-stage-comeback.htm)) show stocks with superior fundamentals. As a group, Sector Leaders have easily outperformed the market, making them a prime choice for ideas.

Use the other screens to scan for companies with above-average sales, profits and margins.

Second, be disciplined about your research.

Any company you study should have at least a 25% increase in earnings and sales in the most recent quarter or two. Long-term growth should be strong, too. Find those details on the mini charts and Smart Tables in IBD.

It is crucial to study the stock's daily and weekly charts, which can tell you if a stock's demand is strong or weak.

For beginners, try Charting The Course, a free chart analysis [class](http://education.investors.com/) at Investors.com.

Third, be disciplined about buying.

You must know in advance the correct buy point for any stock on your watch list.

Confused about that? Then use the brief chart analysis in the IBD mini charts. If there is a clear buy point for a stock, IBD market writers point it out for you in that short description.

Buy your shares only when a stock rises above that level, preferably in heavy volume.

**The endgame**

Fourth, keep strict rules about selling every stock.

Sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price.

Also, sell any stock once you have a profit of 20% to 25%.

A lot more goes into selling, but these two bread-and-butter rules will keep you on the right track.

Fifth, be disciplined about staying with the market trend.

Even if you pick solid firms, a weak market will drag your results. Buy stocks only when the IBD Market Pulse (today on Page B4) says the market is in a confirmed uptrend. When the market comes under pressure, you must be much more careful about buying, and don't buy at all when indexes are in a correction.

Keep in mind that being disciplined doesn't mean you must be inflexible. You'll come across stocks that satisfy most of your rules, but miss on one or two areas. Don't automatically dismiss those. You can buy them at the proper entry and sell them if they don't pan out.

An inexpensive way to learn the investing process is "How to Make Money in Stocks: Getting Started." This IBD book takes readers through the stock search, buying and selling process.

A comprehensive tool is [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), available as a separate service. It selects stocks and shows subscribers exactly where to buy and sell them.

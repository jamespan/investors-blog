  Pyramiding Into A Stock Helps Minimize Buying Risk

Going "all in" can pay off big time in poker. But when it comes to investing, the savvy trader knows that jumping into a stock all at once can be highly risky.

  

If the stock takes off like a rocket, that's great. If it heads south instead, you could find yourself underwater in a flash.

  

To avoid problems, investors can try pyramiding. Legendary investor Jesse Livermore developed the technique, also known as averaging up, to maximize returns and lower risk. You buy in installments, adding shares only if a stock proves itself by advancing.

  

Investors often go the opposite route by averaging down â€” they try to lower their per-share cost by picking up additional shares as a stock declines in price. But that can quickly become a losing proposition if the stock keeps moving lower.

  

"Essentially, I followed up what was working with additional but always smaller purchases, allowing me to concentrate my buying when I seemed to be right," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "If I was wrong and the stock dropped a certain amount below my cost, I sold the stock to cut short every loss."

  

**Buying In Three Parts**

  

So you buy your position in three installments, going from the biggest to the smallest, like a pyramid. Start by using 50% of your allocated funds to make your first purchase. Let's say that you have \$10,000 to spend on a stock. When it breaks out, use \$5,000 to buy shares.

  

If the stock advances 2% to 2.5% from your purchase price, put 30% more of your funds to work toward additional shares. Finally, if it gains another 2% to 2.5% from the second buy point, use the remaining 20% of your capital.

  

This way, you're increasing your investment only if the stock goes in the right direction, thus reducing risk at the same time. Why put more money into a stock on its way down? Better to cut your losses short on the downside.

  

That's where the 7% to 8% loss-cutting rule comes into play. If a stock you own falls that much below what you paid, it triggers the sell rule.

  

**Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) cleared a 54.85 buy point of a long consolidation on the week that ended July 27, 2012, in heavy volume **(1)**. It marked the first entry for investors.

  

The catalyst for the big advance? The HIV drug maker reported Q2 earnings and sales that beat views. It also raised its revenue guidance for the full year.

  

The following week, the stock rose further, to as much as a 7% gain from the 54.85 buy point **(2)**. Because the biotech proved itself by advancing more than the minimum threshold from the proper purchase price, investors could have bought another 30% that week.

  

Those with great conviction in the stock could have actually bought their third and final installment that week, as Gilead proved itself by rising in even heavier volume than the week of its breakout.

  

Shares rallied 28% from the 54.85 buy point before pausing in early October 2012 to shape a flat base. By the time Gilead reached its peak this past June, the stock had run up nearly 350% from that entry.

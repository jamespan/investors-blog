The days when you get just a few basic market facts by calling up a company's stock quote are over.


Recent new enhancements to Investors.com's quotes mean that you can quickly get much of what you need to make a decision on the quality of a stock that might have caught your eye.


Besides the stock's latest price change, you need to know its share volume and the volume's percentage-based change from the previous day. Volume determines whether big institutions are buying or selling your stock. It's the institutions that move the stock up or down in big ways.


If you subscribe to [IBD's Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/), you can click on the Leaderboard button (signified by a green letter 'L') and get a full-size Leaderboard stock chart. If the stock's on the Leaders List or if it's a Sector Leader, Cut List or IBD Top 10 stock, the chart will be annotated in real time, pinpointing buy and sell points and clues to tell you if big institutions are buying or selling the stock.


IBD subscribers can see the paper's proprietary Composite Rating. It combines the Earnings Per Share Rating, Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating and other IBD-only variables that determine the strength of the company and its stock. Investors should zero in on stocks with a Composite Rating of at least 90.


**Air Lease** ([AL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AL)), which currently is building a new base **(1)**, shows a 95 Composite Rating. Its RS Rating of 75 may seem low, but it's risen in the past two weeks. Air Lease is also ranked third in the Commercial Services-Leasing Group.


In the quote's lower left corner , see the Earnings Per Share, Relative Price Strength and Accumulation/Distribution Ratings. If you're a non-subscriber, you see only the EPS Rating and the SMR Rating, which combines a company's sales growth, pretax margins and return on equity.


Potential stock market winners tend to have EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings of 80 or better and SMR Ratings of A or B.


In the stock quote's lower right corner, you get the latest news on the company as reported by IBD.


But that's not all. Below that is other data that an investor needs to know, from the date of the company's next earnings report to its annual return on equity.


While this enhanced quote provides a good snapshot of a company, it's not everything that an investor needs. One should know the company's story. Articles on IBD's New America or Internet & Technology pages shed light on why a firm is an industry leader.

A key tenet of IBD’s investing strategy is to focus on leading stocks in leading industry groups.


When stocks move, they tend to move in groups. If a high-quality Internet name reports strong earnings, it tends to lift other Internet stocks. [IBD research](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735742&sourceid=735749) has shown that close to half of a stock’s price movement is directly tied to the performance of its industry group.


Top-rated stocks with solid fundamentals can be found throughout the pages of IBD. It’s also not hard to keep tabs on leading industry groups in the market.

It’s been a defensive market for a while. Perhaps nowhere is that fact more reflected than in IBD’s industry group rankings. Every day, IBD ranks 197 industry groups based on six-month price performance. IBD's "What’s The Market Trend?" page (today on B4) shows the top 40 groups and worst 40 groups. The top 10 performing groups from the prior session appear in blue, and the 10 worst performers are in red.


The page shows each group’s current ranking as well as its ranking three weeks ago and six weeks ago. Use this area to see which groups are working their way higher through the rankings.


The market is in a confirmed uptrend, thanks to a follow-through day for the Nasdaq on Feb. 17, but the overall tone remains defensive, as gold miners, tobacco, utility and food stocks continue to perform well.


IBD’s [Industry Themes column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-industry-themes/), found daily in the B section of eIBD and the newspaper, spotlights strong performing groups in the market with potential for further upside. Each day, IBD market writers scan the database, looking for groups acting well with broad leadership. A group has potential if its leadership is broad. Groups with just one bona fide leader should generally be avoided.


While it’s still an overall defensive market, some non-defensive groups are holding their own. Earlier this week, IBD's [Industry Themes column](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/chip-stocks-are-showing-tenacity-which-are-the-best/) featured chip stocks. As of Friday’s close, all three chip-related groups ranked within the top 25.


Among chip designers, fast-growing **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) recently cleared a base with a 48.24 early buy point. In the chipmaker group, **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) has cleared a 23.76 cup-with-handle entry. In the chip-equipment group, **KLA-Tencor** ([KLAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLAC)) is approaching a 70.38 buy point from a long cup-with-handle base.


The strength of an industry group can also be assessed with [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) at Investors.com. Enter a stock's ticker symbol, and the site will show its industry group's top five companies based on their Composite Rating.

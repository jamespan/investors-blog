Some stocks send more strong signals than others. When you find one that just reeks with positives, you're often tempted to jump in early, then hope it climbs past its proper buy point.

A valid option for advanced chart readers is to try to determine an [early buy point](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/advanced-buying-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=A011BMT) — one that is lower in price than the standard correct entry.

Some [chart patterns](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786&nav=IBDUCourse5) provide such early entries. Seek out such entry points by drawing a downward-sloping trend line across the high points in a base. Start at the left-side high and touch at least two additional near-term high points on the chart.

You can also find early buy points by drawing lines that start from the left-side high, then across the high of a handle in a [cup-with-handle base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/704851-trend-line-offers-aggressive-investors-lower-entry.htm). This pre-handle trend line identifies a lower buy point.

It's time to buy shares when the stock crosses above the trend line, which marks a technical level of resistance. You want to see volume rise at least 40% above the stock's 50-day trading average.

The "Stocks On The Move" table on the home page of [Investors.com](https://www.investors.com) provides volume data for stocks during the trading day.

Make sure the general market itself is healthy. Then buy as soon as the stock price tops the trend line, before it gets extended in price.

For shorter bases, it's best to draw trend lines using a daily chart. If a base is at least several months long, a weekly stock chart will do.

Keep in mind that early buy points can be risky, and many fail. And many times, strong stocks gap up and bypass the early buy points entirely. **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) in July 2013 and **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) in October that year are two good examples.

**Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) in December 2012 was a different story.

A trend line sat neatly across the top of the weeks ended April 13, 2012, May 4, 2012 and April 12, 2013.

That set out a buy point near 740, a level the stock cracked in rising trade on May 9 and 10, 2013.

Shares rose almost 15% above that early buy point over the next eight sessions. Then Priceline settled back to form a [flat base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/740645-how-to-invest-in-stocks.htm) with an 847.43 buy point before committing to a fresh, eight-month rally.

Investors could have charted standard buy points at 745.34 for the handle, or 775.06 for the cup's left—side high.

From that early buy point to a March 2014 high of 1378.96, the stock gained 86%.

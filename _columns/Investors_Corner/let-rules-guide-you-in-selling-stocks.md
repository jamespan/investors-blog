To succeed in trading, you can't just shoot from the hip. Investors must abide by a set of rules


Sell rules will guide you at certain points of a stock's move, so you won't be a deer in the headlights. Investors should commit to memory at least a dozen sell rules and, of course, act on them.


Using sound rules will help you achieve consistent results. Don't trade on emotion, such as hoping that a losing stock will make a miraculous comeback. Instead just follow sell rules. The following are just a sample.


• Cut losses at no more than 8%. This is the most important rule that will save you from disaster. When a stock falls 8% from your purchase price, just sell to prevent further damage.


• Lock in gains when they amount to 20% to 25%. Take worthwhile profits when you have them. A few 25% winners can make for a good year


• Don't let a big gain turn into a loss. If a stock breaks down after rising more than 10%, don't wait for an 8% loss; preserve gains.


• Closing below the 10-week moving average in significant volume. Consider selling if a stock closes the week Sell when stock ends below its 10-week line in volume that's at least 40% above average.


• Fast recovery to new highs. Sell if a stock moves down sharply for two weeks and then up for two weeks into new high ground.


• Heavy volume without further price progress. Look to sell when a stock, after a long run, moves up and then retraces the bulk of its move in high volume.


• Weekly close below a long trend line. This is a sell signal that could indicate a change in trend.


• Break above a long upper [channel line](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/612307-breaking-upper-channel-line-is-a-sell-signal.htm).Sometimes, this coincides with a climax run.


• Also consider selling when a stock gets 100% or more above its 200-day moving average.


• Big stock splits within a year and a half of each other or less.


• Sell when a company's CEO makes the cover of a mainstream magazine.

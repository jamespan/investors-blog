*Last In A Series*

  

Discouragement. It's tough to avoid in those long months that are dominated by choppy action.

  

Investors might even want to throw in the towel and stop watching the market altogether.

  

It's OK to unplug a little when leading stocks and the broader market are going nowhere. But you can't unplug completely. Even in the worst or choppiest of market conditions, dawn will arrive — and it might come quickly.

  

The summer of 2010 was pretty bleak, but the climate changed rapidly in the late summer. This column will look at that change — marked by the follow-through day on Sept. 1, 2010 — as well as offer some ideas on staying plugged in.

  

• **Check the Market Pulse**: Each day, IBD's Market Pulse info box uses just a few lines of text to provide a brief overview of how stocks are behaving.

  

Frustrated by the market's choppiness? Even if you're so discouraged that you don't want to read any articles about any stock, at least take one minute to scan this info box.

  

The Market Pulse might say the market continues to be in a correction and reveal little promising action among leading stocks. But eventually, you will start to see some more encouraging behavior, and then a change to "market in confirmed uptrend." Broadly speaking, as long as we have a free market and humans are greedy, equities always will rise off their most recent lows at some point.

  

IBD's term for the session that signals a new uptrend is a "follow-through day." It happens when a major index closes up significantly for the day on a sizable increase in volume from the prior session.

  

Follow-throughs generally occur on the fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh day of an attempted rally. It was the fourth day of an attempted rally on Sept. 1, and the follow-through came on the Nasdaq composite. The tech-heavy index jumped 3% in higher turnover.

  

For that week ended Sept. 3, the Nasdaq tacked on 3.7% 1 (go to Investors.com, Education tab to see this weekly chart).

  

• **Don't give it time**: The choppiness might have worn you out and made you extremely suspicious.

  

So you may think to yourself: "I don't trust this rally. The right thing to do is give it time."

  

Wrong. Market leaders generally make big advances early in a new rally. After all, that's why they are considered market leaders.

  

If you wait around for several weeks, months or even years to feel more confident about the uptrend, you could end up with slim pickings. Many true winners will have climbed beyond proper buying ranges already.

  

You'll end up having to make purchases through follow-on buy points, such as from a rebound off the 10-week moving average or from a three-weeks-tight pattern. Or you'll end up buying second-tier leaders.

  

With the Sept. 1 follow-through, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) didn't give investors much time to climb on board. Chipotle broke out past a 154.53 buy point Sept. 1, and it closed beyond a proper buying range Sept. 2. The burrito chain eased back into range briefly, but not for long.

  

Apple breached a 266.09 entry Sept. 9 amid soft trade, then didn't look back as volume picked up.

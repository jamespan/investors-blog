Savvy investors know that a combination of factors, including fundamental and technical, go into successful stockpicking. But if there's a single overriding factor that can greatly improve or hinder the chance of gains on both the long and short side, it's the market. You must always stay on top of which way the market is headed.

Previous articles in this informal [series](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/788652-short-selling-using-the-10-week.htm) at the 10-week moving average, and when to take profits after a successful short sale.

Today's column focuses on that one key component: the market.

"Effective short selling is usually done at the beginning of a new general market decline," IBD Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "This means you have to short based on the behavior of the daily market averages."

Don't fight the market's tide. Three of four stocks follow the market's direction, so most stocks will rise during a bull market. By the same token, more stocks will fall when the market is in a correction.

IBD provides many resources to track the market's direction. You can quickly find IBD's current outlook each day at the top of the front page under the "The Big Picture" header.

To get further details, go to the Market Pulse table inside the [daily Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm?nav=NewsTheBigPicture&t=1452735291010&cachecheck=1) (today on B3). If the current outlook says "Confirmed uptrend," it's not an optimal time for short selling.

"Uptrend under pressure" indicates weakening or uncertainty in the market, which may yield better results for short sellers. But they need to stay on guard in case the market turns higher and goes back to a confirmed uptrend.

When the Market Pulse notes the current outlook as "Market in correction," that's the best time to try to catch falling stocks. Confirm the market's weakness by studying daily and weekly charts of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 (see page B2).

If their 50-day (or 10-week) and 200-day (40-week) moving averages are sloping downward, your chances of making money by shorting stocks go up. When either market index tries to rebound back above its moving average lines but fails, that's another good sign.

**Mobile TeleSystems** ([MBT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBT)) ran up 307% from its June 2006 low of 26 to its early January 2008 high of 105.78. Along the way up, it formed a series of bases, clearing each one with success.

But as MBT worked on the right side of a late-stage pattern in the first half of 2008, the stock eventually ran out of steam. It formed a wide-and-loose cup base, much of it forming below the 10-week line.

After a big gain the week ended May 23, 2008 **(1),** shares stalled and headed south with the market. After a four-year bull run from 2003 to 2007, the broader market was ready for a breather.

MBT set up a short-sale opportunity four weeks later near 80 as the base crumbled and the stock fell below the 10-week moving average in rising volume.

Five weeks later, the short entry enjoyed a gain of 23%, triggering the 20% profit-taking rule. Investors who possessed more conviction may have been holding out for larger gains; as the market plunged, MBT dropped to as low as 20.17 by late October.

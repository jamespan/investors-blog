Two days after a historic U.S. presidential election, the country still appears to show deep divisions.

On Wednesday, fellow Americans in some cities took to the streets, and even closed some highways, to protest Tuesday's election victory by Donald Trump. Why? In a vitriol-infused campaign, the president-elect raised the ire of many citizens and Mexicans with blunt talk about immigrants and women.

Trump's harsh rhetoric intensified the spotlight on issues of economic, racial, gender and social inequality. The Twitter hashtag #BlackLivesMatter became a rallying cry over allegations of racial profiling and reports of unfair treatment by law enforcement. The past two years have been epochal in terms of successful campaigning in some states to raise minimum wages.

What does all of this have to do with stock investing?

Markets work. They provide equality of opportunity.

Anyone who puts in the time and effort to learn how the market really works, and why certain stocks go up more than others, can invest in the market. No matter how much or how little money an investor has, he or she gains the right to succeed financially.

Consider William O'Neil, who founded Investor's Business Daily in 1984 after running a successful equity research investment firm and brokerage since the 1960s. His first purchase in the stock market was a few shares in **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)). Despite some early mistakes, O'Neil never quit.

In the market, when you push the buy button, no one knows or cares what your skin color is, how much or how little school education you've had, what is your street address, or whether you are a man, woman or transgender human being. The market is blind. It works because the stock market is ruled by the law of supply and demand.

Some may say, "Well, don't you need a million dollars to make a million in the stock market?"

Sure, if your goal is to make a million, it may take less time by starting with \$1,000,000 than with \$1,000. But human ego, ignorance and bad decisions can easily shrink that initial wad of big cash.

Far more important: Take all of these steps and stay committed. Consistently save some of your income; get educated about the stock market through programs such as the free [IBD University](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/getting-started/) online courses; read about business trends; follow the daily action of the market itself and the major indexes; make some investments and learn from your mistakes; and stick with solid buy, hold and sell rules.

"The vast majority of our children are financially illiterate when they graduate from high school, and no better educated about money after going through college," Jim Cramer wrote in the 1999 book, "Jim Cramer's Stay Mad for Life."

Contrast the stock market with other markets in this country.

In the book "Phishing for Phools," George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller wrote about a 1990s study in which a group of individuals went  to an auto dealership to ask for car price quotes. They were all age 28 to 32, had three to four years of postsecondary education, wore similar "yuppie" clothes, and drove similar rental cars to the dealers.

So, what did the two lawyer-economists Ian Ayres and Peter Siegelman find?

"In the final negotiated offer, Ayres and Siegelman found that white women were given a quote of \$246 (inflation-adjusted) more than the white men; black women, \$773 more; and black men, \$2,026 more," Akerlof and Shiller wrote. "It suggests that, much more generally, beyond the auto showroom, black men and black women are likely to get bad deals."

Never forget that the stock market doesn't operate that way. Stock quotes are blind to race, gender and religion.

**IBD Series: [Top 22 Sell Rules To Lock In Gains](/NewsAndAnalysis/SpecialReport/559132/201101101401/22-Sell-Rules-To-Increase-Profits.aspx)**

When a great stock finally peaks and dives below its 200-day moving average for good, it most likely flashed earlier signals to sell shares and secure profits.

That said, if you tend to hold long-term leaders through multiyear runs, this selling tool can still help you keep a bundle.

The 200-day moving average line graphs a stock's average closing price over the past 200 trading sessions. By smoothing out the day-to-day fluctuations, it gives you a sense of a stock's general direction over the past 200 days, or roughly 10 months of action. That's why IBD calls it a long-term trend line.

If a leading stock is traversing to new highs and its 200-day line (or 40-week moving average on a weekly chart) is rising, the action is positive. When a stock corrects and forms a new base, it might clip its 200-day and even spend several weeks below it. A true market leader eventually rebounds back above the line and sets up a new base.

Pay close attention to a stock that drops below its 200-day line and the way it falls. Is volume huge? Are the market's leaders also topping?

If the answer is a resounding "yes," then the stock — and perhaps the market — has probably turned to the downside.

The 200-day is more helpful in deciding when to sell large- or mega-cap stocks. When a small- or midcap leader tops after a long move, it's usually still trading miles above its 200-day. Waiting for it to fall all the way to this line means losing too big a portion of your gains.

**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) logged a monster advance in the 1990s. After the 1998 bear market ended, the king of microprocessors surged out of a 10-week cup with handle within a longer base **1**, gained 54%, then traced another three bases over the next year and a half.

Notice how Intel, while etching a double-bottom pattern, spent five weeks below its 40-week line **2**. Yet volume was tame **3**, and in the two down weeks Intel bounced off its lows.

Translation? Healthy demand.

In the third base, formed in the second half of 2009, Intel sprang off its 40-week line the way a talented ballet dancer lifts off her toes **4**.

That wasn't the case in late 2000. In the week ended Sept. 15, Intel slid 12% as 255 million shares changed hands **5**. The next week, the sell-off and volume magnified **6**.

So, what were Intel's "early" sell signals? One, the base that began in late March 2000 was a fourth-stage base. That base showed wide-and-loose action, especially on the left side.

Finally, the market logged a raft of distribution days in late August to early September that year, abruptly ending the summer rally.

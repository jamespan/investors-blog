[IBD's 20 Rules](https://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/SpecialReport/583489/201109141435/IBDs-20-Rules-for-Your-Investment-Success.aspx): **An Investor's Corner Series**

_Sixteenth In A Series_

To succeed in investing, you've got to know when to exit a good stock and lock in your profits. With that in mind, IBD has developed a couple dozen sell rules.

This column will look at a few of those rules, as well as how they could have been applied to **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) earlier this year.

For a review of all of the rules, check out the 22-part Investor's Corner series published at the start of this year and still available on Investors.com. The series is called "22 Sell Rules to Increase Profits."

Overall, the goal with every one of these rules is to get out while the getting is good. As famed Wall Street trader Joe Kennedy once put it: "The object is to get out while a stock is up before it has a chance to break and turn down."

In Priceline's case, an IBD-style investor could have bought the stock in early January as it jumped out of a second-stage flat base **1**. (Chart shows part of the flat base.) The buy point was at 428.20.

(The online travel broker's first-stage base was an extremely deep, cup-like pattern that it surged out of in August 2010. This structure's correction was severe enough to reset the base count.)

By April 2011, Priceline was starting to trigger one of IBD's sell rules: Exit once you're up 20%. You could have sold it in early April for a 20% gain **2**.

But the stock was hitting new highs in above-average daily trade, and the general market remained in an uptrend. So you might have held on for a while longer. By late April, however, Priceline had set off another sell rule: hitting new highs in soft volume **3**.

Then an additional sell rule was triggered in early May, as Priceline pulled back from a high at 561.88. That's when it had an increase in consecutive down days **4**.

William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has explained this sell rule as follows: "For most stocks, the number of consecutive down days in price relative to up days in price will probably increase when the stock starts down from its top. You may see four or five days down, followed by two or three days up, whereas before you would have seen four days up and then two or three down."

Priceline so far hasn't gotten back to its prior high at 561.88.

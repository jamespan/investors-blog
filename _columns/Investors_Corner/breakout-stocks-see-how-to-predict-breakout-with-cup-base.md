As investors, we're always on the lookout for actionable plays and [breakout stocks](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-the-best-stocks-to-buy-and-watch-start-here/). But to find these, learn to identify key chart patterns, known as [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). A base is a technical area of consolidating price action that gives a hot stock a support area from which to break out.




The cup base is one of [eight important patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) that IBD investors look for in potential [breakout stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Breakout Stocks: How To Spot A Cup Base
---------------------------------------


Investors.com research finds that the cup remains one of the most successful patterns, perhaps second only to the [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). To spot a [cup without a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/), you'll want to identify these following criteria. First, the stock needs to show a 30% uptrend from a price point that occurs before the base's construction. But if this is a second stage base or later, the stock only needs to show a minimum 20% increase from that prior base's breakout.


Next, the cup area of the base should be a minimum of six weeks long, or 30 days on a daily chart. During that time, investors want to see a decline of no more than 30% to 33% from high to low within the base.


To locate the traditional buy point, investors want to take the high of the left side of the base and add 10 cents. This becomes your proper entry and you'd typically wait until the stock reaches this level before considering it a breakout stock or actionable now.


Using Early Entries Within Cup Bases
------------------------------------


Aggressive investors may also consider using an earlier entry that would snag shares at an even lower buy point. This is a great strategy to use during [markets with heavy sector rotation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-sector-rotation/) as breakouts from traditional buy points are often foiled by a sector falling out of favor.


As the cup forms its left side, it'll often leave a trail of lower highs; you can connect these highs to form a downward-sloping trend line. Once the stock breaks above this trend line inside the base, use it as a signal to initiate a position.


Investors also want to see evidence of institutional accumulation and a [rising relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). Spot this accumulation by using the Accumulation/Distribution Rating. When this rating rises to a B grade or higher, it signals strong accumulation over the past 13 weeks. Investors also want to see the RS line, drawn in blue on [MarketSmith charts](https://marketsmith.investors.com/mstool), rising and even hitting new highs alongside the breakout.


Cup Base In Nucor Stock
-----------------------


![nucor](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IC112921-300x161.jpg)Among notable breakout stocks, **Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) formed a cup that began in mid-January 2021, according to the [MarketSmith chart analysis tool](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). MarketSmith's pattern recognition helps investors spot these bullish patterns. The cup completed six weeks later. The peak of the left side of the cup at 58.52, plus 10 cents, shows you a proper buy point of 58.62.


During the week ended Feb. 26, Nucor scored a breakout as shares gained momentum above the buy point.


The stock then continued 41% higher, scoring investors an excellent gain.


Another key element of Nucor's base? The symmetry. Investors want to see cup bases that show mirror-like action on the left and right sides.

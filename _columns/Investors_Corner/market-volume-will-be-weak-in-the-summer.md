Volume is key when a stock stages a breakout from a base. But it's also important to study changes in the level of activity in the overall market.


Market volume is simply the number of shares that changed hands between buyers and sellers on major stock exchanges such as the Nasdaq and the NYSE.


Market volume is also a major determinant behind the conviction in a move. Market gains in high volume signal that institutions such as mutual funds and hedge funds are buying with gusto. Losses in big turnover point to big selling by [the pros](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/681491-savvy-investors-study-stock-market-corrections.htm?ntt=Investor%27s+Corner+market+top+distribution+days).


So when the market is in rally mode, it's best to see price action accompanied by heavy or rising volume. That way, you know that big money is behind a move.


But not every up or down day in the market will have high turnover behind it. And that's normal.


Sometimes, seasonality or other factors will affect the amount of trading activity. Overall volume tends to be low during the summertime as many market participants go on vacation. Turnover usually picks back up in early September.


Pre-holiday sessions are other times where volume will run bone-dry.


To keep tabs on overall volume in the major exchanges, use the resources in IBD and on Investors.com each day.


On stock charts, the volume bars are found in the lower pane. On a daily chart, you'll see a 50-day moving average line. It allows you to see if volume that day was heavy, light or simply average.


On IBD's "What's The Market Trend?" page (today on B3), the volume bar will be blue if a market index was up that day, and it'll be red if the index fell. These colored bars make for easy reference.


For CAN SLIM investors, volume is crucial in monitoring the level of [distribution days](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/681292-what-is-distribution-in-the-stock-market.htm?ref=HPLNews) (down days of 0.2% or more, in volume higher than the prior session in the Nasdaq and the S&P 500). A high number of distribution days in a short period of time can derail a market uptrend.


You can find the two main stock exchanges' volume figures at the top of the IBD's front page. Nasdaq volume is the number of shares traded on the Nasdaq, a fully electronic stock exchange.


NYSE volume is more complicated. The figure is actually NYSE composite volume, which includes trading activity from regional exchanges that trade NYSE-listed stocks. Unlike the Nasdaq, the NYSE, which has roots dating back to 1792, is an actual physical exchange where trading takes place on a trading floor. But NYSE-listed stocks are also traded on electronic exchanges such as BATS and NYSE Arca.


NYSE composite volume is bigger than NYSE-only volume. IBD made the switch to NYSE composite volume in 2012. Back on March 12, 2009, volume was 1.798 billion shares on the NYSE compared to 2.772 billion on Sept. 2 this year (see the attached illustration).


Also check out the volume figures broken down hourly on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, as noted in tables found in IBD's Making Money section (today on B11). This can help you get more details on whether big money is supporting a move. The market can have a late-day surge and finish right at its session high.

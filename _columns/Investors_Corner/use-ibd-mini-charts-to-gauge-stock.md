A mechanic looks under the hood to assess a car's health, just like a doctor uses an X-ray to assess a patient's health.

Mini charts, found throughout the pages of IBD, are a quick way to get a grasp on a stock's fundamental and technical health.

They're everywhere in IBD, found in sections like Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight, IPO Leaders, Your Weekly Review and the IBD 50. Each mini chart comes with a quick chart analysis written by an IBD market writer. In some cases, stocks will be near buy points. In other cases, some will be extended. Whatever the case, these short descriptions help readers understand if a stock should be on their radar.

Charts in the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders are color-coded to help you gauge institutional buying and selling in a stock. A stock with a black border in Sector Leaders alerts you to the fact that it's the focal point of the Sector Leaders Review article and the stock is near a buy point.

Mini charts are loaded with key fundamental data. A stock's annual return and pretax margin are shown. High return on equity helps separate well-managed companies from poorly managed ones.

A stock's three-year annualized earnings growth rate is shown too. Look at this data point alongside recent quarterly earnings growth. An earnings growth rate of 25% or more, for example, should be confirmed by equally strong earnings growth in recent quarters.

Earnings and sales growth in the latest reported quarter is also shown. An up or down arrow signifies if growth accelerated or decelerated from the prior quarter. Estimated earnings growth for the current quarter is also shown. In Sector Leaders mini charts, you get a stock's average EPS growth in the past three reported quarters.

In IBD 50 and Stock Spotlight charts, the number of consecutive quarters in which quarterly earnings per share growth has topped 15% is shown.

All of the data are provided to ensure you're fishing in the right pond for stocks. Stocks showing exceptional earnings and sales growth can often go on to become big winners.

A stock's trailing P-E ratio is also shown. IBD downplays the importance of the P-E ratio during the research process — and for good reason. Investors often shun high P-E stock even though many become market leaders.

It's always a good idea to know whether a stock is selling at a high valuation, but a seemingly high P-E ratio should never impede your decision to buy a quality stock — especially if there's a compelling growth story that supports what seems like a high valuation.

Float is also shown. It's calculated by subtracting shares closely held by management by total shares outstanding. Remember that companies with smaller floats, say 10 million to 20 million shares, can be more volatile.

Specialty retailer **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) has been a mainstay in Sector Leaders for some time now. Its mini chart paints a compelling picture.

Growth concerns dogged the stock in late 2013, but shares have rallied back nicely amid renewed signs of institutional buying. Its mini chart shows a bounce off its 10-week moving average during the week ended Oct. 17. It's trying to clear a long cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 121.53.

It has a three-year annualized earnings growth rate of 31%. In its latest reported quarter, earnings jumped 34% from a year ago, an acceleration from 18% growth in the prior quarter. Ulta is debt-free, an impressive accomplishment considering the company's fast expansion.

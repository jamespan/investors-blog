What does a stock's price tell you? A lot of things, but one thing in particular if you want to learn how to invest in growth stocks: Quality.

The price of any stock is a transparent piece of information, a data point, that gives you an objective reading of the stock's quality issued by thousands and, in some cases, millions of investors. All have skin in the game, as the cliche goes. Virtually all care enough to do at least some research. They back up their opinions with real money, not words.

And contrary to common belief among non-investors, individual stock prices are not random events. They are the best indicator of stock quality there is.

Consider the case of **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)). In the 1980s, even some Wall Street analysts pooh-poohed its success, suggesting that old-standby No. 1 Sears, Roebuck & Co. would get its act together and hold on to its retailing crown. After all, Sears was branching out into financial services, including insurance, stocks and bonds, the Discover credit card, and even real estate. How could Walmart compete?

Well, with relentless focus, it opened hundreds of discount stores offering "everyday low prices" across the country. The Walmart model spread from small town, rural America into bigger cities and suburbs. It remade the discount store concept with its sophisticated inventory management and aggressive pricing strategies.

Walmart's ultimate position as the nation's No. 1 retailer in the hypercompetitive retailing business was foretold as early as 1983, as a look at its stock chart shows.

While the country was mired in two consecutive deep economic recessions that began in January 1980 and lasted until November of 1982, Walmart built base after base, rising as it went.

## How To Invest: Fundamentals First

Revenue growth was even better, just a shade below 40%, year over year.

When the recessions ended and the early 1980s tax cuts kicked in, Walmart went into overdrive. After forming a 13-week-long third-stage [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) starting in early December of 1982 **(1)**, it broke out above the 54.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on March 16, 1983. From there it shot up to a near-term high of 81.63 by mid-June of that year, a 50% price gain in just three months.

During its extraordinary three-month run, it stayed well ahead of its 50-day moving average. And its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) continued to move to new highs, signaling Walmart's leadership.

Nor was this the retailing giant's first big run at the time. In late June of 1982, Walmart broke out of a cup with a 26.85 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) **(2)**. Walmart sagged for a few days before ramping out of that base and rising 102% in six months.

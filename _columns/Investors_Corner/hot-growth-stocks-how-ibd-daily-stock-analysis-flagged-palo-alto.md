IBD readers who glanced at the [Daily Stock Analysis feature](http://ibdtv.investors.com/?dimension=IBD%20Stock%20Analysis&nav=IBDTVISA) in March of last year would have come across a stock that was just starting to show promise. **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) had gone public in July 2012 amid a sharp increase in viruses, identity theft and other cyberattacks.

By the end of 2013, Palo Alto was posting strong quarterly profit and sales growth amid rising demand for its next-generation firewall software aimed at keeping corporate data centers safe from attacks, malware and other security breaches. It was also a leading stock in IBD's highly rated Computer Software-Security industry group.

In the week ended March 28, 2014, Palo Alto pulled back to its 10-week moving average after clearing a 65.02 buy point of a cup-with-handle base.

Normally, the test of support would give investors a chance to buy more shares. But the market was in a correction, a red flag.

As a result, the Daily Stock Analysis article that appeared on March 28 **(1)** concluded, "Palo Alto Networks may be one to watch as we wait for a new uptrend to begin."

Palo Alto went on to form a double-bottom base that offered a buy point at 72.60. The stock cleared the buy point on May 29, gapping up 5% in big volume. In fact, weekly volume was the highest since the stock's IPO. Moreover, the market was back in a confirmed uptrend.

Palo Alto's gain that day was fueled by a round of positive developments, including a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report, an analyst upgrade and the settlement of a patent dispute with **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)).

The stock had also continued to boast strong fundamentals. Profit growth in the three quarters prior to its breakout ranged from 60% to 100%. Sales growth was also strong, rising 49%, 48% and 46% over that span.

As a result, Palo Alto had a respectable Composite Rating of 91 and an Earnings Per Share Rating of 89 when it cleared its buy point. Palo Alto was also an IBD [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) stock prior to its breakout and it had shown up in the IPO Analysis screen.

From its breakout, Palo Alto climbed up its rising 10-week moving average for the next nine months. On March 3 of this year, the stock hit a record high of 149.35, more than doubling from the 72.60 buy point.

Currently, Palo Alto is extended from a 129.52 flat-base entry that it cleared during the week ended Feb. 13.

Palo Alto continues to boast strong fundamentals. Profit growth has picked up for two straight quarters, jumping 57%, 88% and 90% in the past three periods. Its Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings are now a best-possible 99. Its RS is 96. Its industry group continues to be a leader. That makes it a good watch-list candidate once again.

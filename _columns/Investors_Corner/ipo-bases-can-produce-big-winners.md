As detailed in the Nov. 24 [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/782127-ipos-can-be-risky-but-profitable.htm), buying stocks that have recently gone public can bring much joy â€” or pain. Today's column emphasizes how key it is to correctly identify an IPO base and then locate the proper buy point.

The most difficult part of buying a stock as it crosses the correct buy point in an IPO base may be working up the nerve to hit the "buy" button. That's because these stocks have no history of price and volume action. Many have little or no earnings track record on which to evaluate their growth prospects. So they can be volatile as investors try to determine fair value for the shares.

**Habit Restaurants** ([HABT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HABT)) offers a cautionary tale. It cleared a 40.35 IPO-base buy point on Dec. 11, 2014, hitting a high of 44.20. But the stock plunged 16% the following week, erasing the 10% gain to set off a round-trip sell signal. The burger chain now trades 45% off its peak.

Where there's risk, however, there's also reward.

**Inphi** ([IPHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPHI)) went public on Nov. 11, 2010, at \$11 a share. The designer of data-transmission chips then cleared a 16.68 buy point of a narrow 11-day IPO base in the week ended Dec. 10, 2010, in volume that was much higher than the previous two weeks. The stock climbed to a peak of 21.94 four weeks later before pulling back to its 10-week moving average.

From there, Inphi rebounded to a peak of 27.20 in the week ended Feb. 18, 2011, good for a gain of 63% in just 11 weeks.

IBD's A section publishes a nearly daily table providing the price action of recent IPOs, along with a list of upcoming IPOs. The daily stock tables show how stocks rank on key IBD fundamental and technical criteria, but IPO issues typically have low ratings because they're often just at the start of their growth phases. Plus, their trading history is short.

Yet it's still possible to get a feel for a company's prospects. Examining filings such as the 424(b) document submitted ahead of a company's IPO provides a description of the company's business, earnings data, risk factors and other key information.

IBD's [IPO Analysis column](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm), which appears every Tuesday and Thursday, highlights recently listed stocks and flags those that have shaped good bases.

Beyond that, investors should scrutinize both the daily and weekly charts of stocks that have shaped IPO bases. In the case of Inphi, its weekly chart shows the stock breaking out of its IPO base in volume that was well above the average of the prior three weeks, excluding the spike in turnover that occurred in its IPO week.

Volume on the daily chart accelerated and was above average (excluding the IPO day) as Inphi broke out. That's encouraging.

The chart showed tight trading as Inphi for the most part closed in the top half of its daily or weekly trading range. This suggested heavy institutional support.

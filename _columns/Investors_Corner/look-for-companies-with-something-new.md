The 'N' in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/), or "New," can provide the catalyst that sparks a big move in a stock. New products and services, new management, or a shift in industry conditions and regulations can transform a lagging company into a leading one.

It could take a lot of work on your own to find companies with the N factor. But there's a wealth of resources in IBD and online at Investors.com that simplify and help speed up the process of finding such companies.

• **Read The New America**. Each day, [The New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm) will profile a company that has the traits of a winning growth stock. Having a watch list of stocks of companies with fast top and bottom-line growth is good, but understanding what's driving those numbers is even better. New America articles will tell you what's behind the growth through interviews with management and analysts.

**Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) was featured in the Oct. 18, 2011, edition of The New America, which noted its "Charged Cotton" line of apparel and wicked-away moisture, along with other products. Under Armour cleared a 40.45 buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) in a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Oct. 28 in big volume **(1)**.

Although it has been a tough stock to hold, Under Armour has been a big winner. The stock presented multiple entry points as shares rose 51% by Sept. 2012 **(2)** .

• **Check New Issues America** . This feature sometimes replaces the New America story. Many times new issues can go on to become some market's biggest winners. New Issues America provides an in-depth look at a highly anticipated company that's about to go public.

The Sept. 16 edition featured Chinese e-commerce titan **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), which turned out to be the biggest initial public offering in history. The stock broke out from an IPO base in late October and jumped 20% in a little over two weeks.

• **Read Internet & Technology**. Featured daily, the Internet & Technology section is another place to find companies that have the N factor. With breakthrough products and services in the tech world, the I&T section can point out some of the fastest-growing firms. It can also keep you up to speed on what's happening in the industry and emerging technologies.

• **Scan The New High List**. The N in CAN SLIM doesn't have to only be about a company's new offerings. It can also point to a new high in a firm's stock. Investors can find a list of new 52-week highs each day in the newspaper's B section.

The stocks making new highs (and new lows) are grouped by sectors for easy reference. These can quickly show you which areas of the market are showing strength.

Just below the table of new highs is the New High List Analysis column (see B1 in today's paper). This article will point you to breakout stocks and trends of issues making new highs.

In recent weeks, the Building, Medical, Real Estate and Retail sectors have dominated the new highs portion of the list.

• **Check IBD Screen Center** . The Screen Center on Investors.com has a number of rotating stock screens to help you find top-rated stocks. Tech Leaders filters for leading stocks across five areas in technology.

**Handling A Choppy Uptrend:** _[Fourth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/621258/201208071356/handling-a-choppy-uptrend.aspx)_

There are many offensive and defensive strategies for navigating uncertain markets.

But over the past several years, one of the most productive strategies has been combining the two.

Some savvy investors identified several types of stocks that are seen as defensive, but were also attacking high-growth market opportunities.

The lesson? Be flexible.

An IBD reader can track these subtle trends by paying close attention to strong industry group action. The daily rankings of 197 industry subgroups, today on Page B7, are a fine place to search.

Defensive stocks are typically counter-cyclical: They benefit on the downside of the business cycle. Tobacco and medical stocks fit the bill: Consumers tend to cling to both even when money is tight.

Power and water utilities are also defensive â€” financially conservative and high on consumers' priority lists. These also often provide healthy dividends, a big plus in a weak market. Yet electrical utilities also faced some stress in 2011 because the economy remained soft. Demand lagged.

But the group received three boosts. First, natural gas prices plummeted, cutting utility input costs. Second, low gas prices forced down coal prices, another major input. Third, federal legislation began to squeeze out the oldest, least efficient coal plants, opening market share for more efficient producers.

The group rose 16% in 2011 vs. a flat performance for the S&P 500. As the IBD industry groups table shows, every year can be quite different. Utility-Electric Power was ranked No. 72 as of Thursday's IBD and up just 2.8% since Jan. 1.

Auto parts retailers were another "dual-purpose" play. Parts sellers gain when consumers nurse their old cars along rather than buy new. These firms seized on the downturn's opportunities. They aggressively controlled regional inventory and collected sales data to identify localized buying behavior.

The result: They squeezed out many smaller players and gobbled up market share. The group gained 16% for the year.

Dollar-store chains, which gain when consumers turn budget-conscious, went on the offensive. They offered more food and other staples to lure customers.

In addition, they placed stores along routes to pre-empt shoppers headed for **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) stores. This strategy proved to be highly effective, shaving market share from the big box players.

The outcome: a 32% gain for the industry group in 2011. At the head of the group, **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) swept ahead 48% in 2011.

Investors had chances to jump into Dollar Tree's run early or late, with few buy points in between.

The stock broke out from a long, flat base in February 2010 **1.** It held a 91 Composite Rating at the time. It later cleared a cup base in April 2011 as well as a nine-week cup with handle at 74.82 on Sept. 14 in strong trade. (Please see a weekly chart.)

That move has produced a 55% gain from its September breakout through June of this year, far outstripping the general market.

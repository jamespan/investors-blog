Context means a lot when you're trying to understand just what a company does and identify its strengths. And context, in the business world, means industry. As you study a company and try to determine if it's going to be a profit gusher, ask these questions. Where does it fit into a particular industry? What is its market share? Its competitive strengths? How about its growth prospects as well as the growth outlook for the industry itself?

These are all vital things to know when deciding which stock is the [industry leader](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735742&sourceid=735749). That is why IBD delivers its Industry Snapshot feature every Monday. (The [articles](http://news.investors.com/business/industry-snapshot.htm) and accompanying charts also appear at investors.com on Friday afternoons.)

The feature takes groups of stocks covered elsewhere in IBD and at Investors.com, and pulls the camera back to get a wider view of the environments in which the companies behind those stocks compete. It typically focuses on industries that rank in the Top 20 of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks or on lower-ranked industries that are rising rapidly. Such increases show institutional funds flowing into an industry sector and can be an excellent bird dog for up-and-coming stocks.

This week's [snapshot](http://news.investors.com/business-industry-snapshot/071715-762199-managed-care-insurers-build-scale.htm) looks closely at why the Supreme Court's June 25 decision on the Affordable Care Act triggered a massive round of consolidation among managed care insurers such as **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)), **Cigna** ([CI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CI)) and **Anthem** ([ANTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANTM)). The story explores, among other factors, the profit prospects for those stocks in the evolving environment.

This is crucial information.

A snapshot published May 8 explored barriers that non-Chinese companies in the red-hot video gaming industry faced when they were attempting to enter China's massive gaming market.

In April, Snapshots explored the move toward dividend-generating "yieldcos" by wind and solar energy utilities; outlined crucial challenges faced by markets of fiber-optic networking gear in moving to faster, larger-capacity networks; and explained how the world restaurant picture changed with the **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) restructuring plan and **Chipotle Mexican Grill's** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) boycott of certain pork products.

Context creates a big-picture, or holistic, approach to piecing together a company's fundamentals so as to provide a more broad-based investment thesis. This is precisely the role that Industry Snapshots plays: what a firm faces in terms of changing markets, competition, rising prices and the countless other, impossible-to-guess factors that threaten to catch an investor off guard.

If you want to learn how to invest in winning stocks, you must learn to recognize key technical elements in a stock's chart. First and foremost, investors need to identify proper [bases,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) which give a clear price at which to buy shares. Investors also must learn to identify a stock's base count.




True market leaders typically form and break out of several [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) over the course of a long-term advance.


When it comes to base count, the lower the number the better. Investors should think twice before buying from a fourth-stage or even later pattern. Late-stage bases are an important warning sign to investors.


But stocks eventually rejuvenate themselves: Any time a stock undercuts its prior base, it [resets the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/). This means, the next base can be treated as a first-stage base. That is why it's important to know how to count bases.


How To Invest: Counting Bases In Leading Stocks
-----------------------------------------------


Investors must keep track of how many bases formed since the last reset. The first couple of bases (first- and second-stage patterns) tend to produce much larger gains than third or later bases. According to IBD research, the success rate for breakouts from third-stage bases is around 67%. The failure rate climbs to 80% for fourth-stage bases.


You'll likely see a [first-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/many-tech-ipos-can-fail-on-their-first-breakout-just-like-emc-did-in-1986/) form after a market correction or a major decline in the stock. The first valid base needs a prior uptrend of 30% or more.


How To Count Bases
------------------


Here are a few tips for counting bases:


One important rule is that a stock must rise more than 20% from the buy point to be considered in the next base. If it fails to advance 20% before forming the next base, this might be considered a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/). These count as a single stage in your base count.


Often, a stock will form multiple bases before attaining the 20% gain needed to advance the base count up a level.


Additionally, leading stocks often generate add-on buy points in between bases. Such alternative entries might include a [three-weeks-tight pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) or a [pullback to the 10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). Be aware that these interim entries don't affect the overall base count.


Intuitive Surgical's Base Count And Reset
-----------------------------------------


An example of a stock's base count in action is with **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) from 2018.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IC_isrg051721-300x161.jpg)The initial first-stage [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) formed from October 2016 to January of 2017 **(1)** after the stock undercut a prior base. Intuitive surged 73%, until the stock formed a second-stage [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) in December 2017 that broke out the next month **(2).** Shares consolidated in early 2018 **(3)** and in April and May **(4)**. Each of these three bases formed within 20% of each other, keeping the base count at second-stage for all three bases.


In June of 2018, shares broke out from another flat base and rose 22% **(5)**. Then, Intuitive Surgical formed a third-stage [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) from October 2018 through November 2018 **(6)**. But a breakout at a 546.16 buy point quickly failed. Shares toppled over and undercut the low of the double-bottom base.


This reset the base count back to first stage. From there, Intuitive formed a couple of early bases and eventually climbed as much as 13.5% before the coronavirus bear market hit.

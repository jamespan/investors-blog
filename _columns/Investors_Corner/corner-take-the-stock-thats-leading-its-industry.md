Don't settle for the second- or third-best company in an industry group.

  

Go for the top dog.

  

That's one of the foundations of CAN SLIM, IBD's investing strategy. The "L" in CAN SLIM stands for "Leader."

  

It means that IBD-style investors should buy the top stock in an industry group.

  

William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has written that you should buy the companies that are No. 1 in their particular fields.

  

"By number one, I don't mean the largest company or the one with the most recognized brand name," he wrote in his best-seller, "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

"I mean the one with the best quarterly and annual earnings growth, the highest return on equity, the widest profit margins, the strongest sales growth, and the most dynamic stock-price action. This type of company will also have a unique and superior product or service and be gaining market share from its older, less-innovative competitors."

  

O'Neil has said that his best big winners all matched this description when he bought them, such as **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) in 1998-99, **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) in 2002-04 and **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) in 2004-07.

  

Another good example of an industry leader would be **Research In Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)) from 2004 through 2007.

  

The maker of BlackBerry smartphones was a pioneer in producing Web-enabled handsets, though in recent years it's been losing market share to **Apple's** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) iPhone and phones running Google's Android operating system.

  

RIM got back in the black in 2004, after posting a loss in 2003.

  

The Canadian company then reported per-share earnings growth of 331% in 2005, 18% in 2006 and 33% in 2007.

  

Sales gains were also impressive during those years, ramping up from just a 4% increase in 2003.

  

Revenue jumped 94% in 2004, 127% in 2005, 53% in 2006 and 47% in 2007.

  

Those strong fundamentals helped the stock advance by a factor of roughly 10 — or 1,000% — from the end of 2003 through the end of 2007.

  

You would have wanted to hold on to this clear leader, rather than get involved with one of the less-impressive names in RIM's industry group, such as Palm, Motorola or even Finnish mobile phones giant **Nokia** ([NOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOK)). After all, all three lost market share to RIM at that time.

  

During its big advance, RIM was often featured in IBD.

  

"Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM has a definite first-mover advantage in the wireless e-mail business," said a May 2004 article in IBD's Internet & Technology section. It added: "Some firms are deploying more than 10,000 BlackBerry devices."

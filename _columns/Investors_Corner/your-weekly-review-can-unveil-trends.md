In school, you can't expect to do well if you don't do your homework. Investing works much the same way.


Doing research is vital to your stock market success. Yes, it'll take time and effort to uncover the market's best stocks. But IBD's Your Weekly Review is there to help.


Published in every Friday's paper, [Your Weekly Review](https://www.investors.com/search/searchresults.aspx?Ntt=Your+Weekly+Review) is a computer-generated screen of the market's top stocks, of which up to 120 of them are featured with a mini chart.


To make it on the list, stocks must have have Earnings Per Share Rankings and Relative Price Strength Ratings of 85 and up. Stocks also have to be priced above 10 a share and trading within 15% of a 52-week high.


In addition, stocks on the list must trade at least 10,000 shares a day on average. This is why many thinly traded issues get airplay on Weekly Review but not in other key IBD screens.


Use Your Weekly Review to build your watch lists, spot market themes and gauge the overall market environment. Investors should use the feature regularly to keep their watch list updated.


First, there's a short column that'll highlight stocks close to breaking out or key themes occurring in the market.


In the accompanying tables, there are key ratings for each stock. Also take a look at the very last column to see if a top-performing mutual fund added or reduced their holdings in a leader.


The mini charts will tell you whether a stock is in a buyable pattern or if it's extended from proper buying range. Where? See the line of text at the bottom of each chart. If a stock is building a base, the chart analysis will strive to point out the type of structure that is forming, as well as positive or negative characteristics.


Also pay attention to what industry groups are dominating or those that have left the list. Stocks tend to move in groups; your chances of success with a stock improve if its industry group shows true strength.


You can use the list to gauge the strength or the health of the market. Rallies carried by lower-priced, thinly traded issues are not a good sign.


In good times, Weekly Review may show four full pages of charts, and the table might actually feature even more stocks. But as the table shows, in bad times, the list can shrink dramatically.

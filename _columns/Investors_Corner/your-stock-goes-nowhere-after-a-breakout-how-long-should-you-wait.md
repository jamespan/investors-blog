  Your Stock Goes Nowhere After A Breakout: How Long Should You Wait?

The toughest challenge in investing is playing the gray areas correctly. The gray areas are like fog. Clarity takes time.


Imagine a stock you've been watching breaks out in strong volume. You buy some shares.


And then the stock stutters, retreats off its highs and begins to move sideways. Suppose the stock chops around indecisively for a week. Do you sell it? How about two weeks or three weeks? Just when do you abandon such a stock?


What would IBD founder William J. O'Neil advise? In "How to Make Money in Stocks," O'Neil offered this advice:


"When a stock breaks out of a proper base, after its first move up, 80% ofÂ the time it will pull back somewhere between its second and its sixth week out of the base. Holding for eight weeks, of course, gets you through this first selling squall and into a resumed uptrend, and you'll then have a better profit cushion."


O'Neil also writes, "In a few cases, you may have to allow 13 weeks after your first purchase before you conclude that a stock that hasn't moved is a dull, faulty selection. This, of course, applies only if the stock did not reach your defensive, loss-cutting sell price first."

Eight weeks? Thirteen weeks? That's probably more patience than most people would've guessed. But if a stock is not flashing sell signals, patience makes sense. Not every stock is going to move perfectly in time with the market. Some stocks get caught in a patch of fog, and it takes time for the fog to lift.


**International Game Technology** ([IGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGT)) broke out of a flat base in the week ended March 21, 2003, clearing a split-adjusted 20.27 buy point **(1)**. The stock broke out the same day the Nasdaq flashed a Day 4 follow-through, confirming a new uptrend for the market.


The changed market outlook, and International Game's breakout on the follow-through day were reasons to give IGT time to work.


In the first three weeks after the breakout, the stock pulled back to 3.5% under the buy point. No sell signal was triggered, but the nowhere action tested the patience of new shareholders.


At the eight-week mark **(2)**, the stock was 9% above the buy point. By Week 13, the gain was 17%. Either way, there was no reason to sell.


Eventually, the gain reached 132% in 13 months.

Countless financial advisors will tell you there’s no way to time the market. Investors, they preach, need to just buy and hold for the long term and let the market’s long-term magic do its work.


The truth is, investors *can* time the market -- if they can interpret the right bottoming and topping signals.


To be sure, those are not easy to spot. It takes study and practice in reading charts to find the critical movements in what may look like a dense forest of price and volume bars. Yet, it’s not an impossible task.


Market bottoms always share the same characteristic: a strong rally that comes several days after the indexes have made a low and are heading higher. Specifically, you look for the Nasdaq or S&P 500 to rally at least 1% in higher volume than the prior session. This surge needs to happen sometime after the third day that the index makes its low.


This is called a follow-through, and you’ll find one in every significant market bottom. Not every follow-through results in a new market uptrend; some false signals happen from time to time. But it’s the surest signal to begin to move into stocks.


Not all follow-throughs work out, yet IBD research has found that every major market bottom going back to 1900 featured one. When a follow-through works out well, expect to see a growing number of highly rated stocks break out to new highs in huge volume.

The composite had tumbled 13% from late March of that year. On June 4 **(1)** a 0.5% gain marked a potential market bottom. Despite some volatility in the days that followed, the index continued rising and never undercut the June 4 low. Ten days into the rally attempt, the Nasdaq’s 1.3% surge in higher volume marked a follow-through signal **(2)**. The Nasdaq continued climbing to a Sept. 21 peak.


As far as the market tops go, there is a separate set of signals to watch for. Basically, you’ll start to see the indexes fall in heavy volume over several days.


A decline in higher volume than the prior session is known as a distribution day. Once you see five, six or more of those happen within a few weeks, you know institutional investors are backing away from stocks, and a top is possible. It's the best time to consider selling stocks and raising cash, cutting your weakest ones in the portfolio quickly and watching the best plays closely for key sell signals.


The market never peaks in the blink of an eye. Institutions require weeks or months to drop to a level of exposure they are comfortable with. But their earliest steps will always be revealed thanks to distribution days.


While it’s straightforward to find a collection of distribution days, some are more damaging than others. That’s where some close analysis can be helpful.


The market top of September 2014 had no shortage of distribution. There were seven distribution days in the month **(3)**. A 1.6% plunge on Oct. 1 was another one, and by that time IBD’s market outlook in its daily [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) had changed to “Market in correction” **(4)**.  The index slid nearly 11% from peak to bottom. The next follow-though was Oct. 21.


The Big Picture tracks the bottoming and topping signals, and if critical levels are reached, those are reported. Thus, the column (today on page B3) is indispensable.

When it comes to trading growth stocks, there is no pattern more reliable than the cup with handle base.

Defined by IBD founder William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks," the pattern gets its name because it looks like the outline of cup and its handle when traced over a stock chart: A run-up to a new high, a pullback, a climb back and a final, shorter pullback before it launches to new highs. If the timing is right, the stock will be making new highs.

The cup-with-handle patterns can be anywhere from seven to 65 weeks, though they generally last around three to six months. Like any good pattern, a successful cup needs a strong uptrend prior to its formation. Look for at least a 30% increase in price combined with improving relative strength.

The cup's depth, the drop from its absolute high to its low, can be up to 33% though typically it is less than that. Most cups will have a round "U" shaped bottom rather than a sharp V-shaped one.

This aspect of the cup is crucial. A rounded bottom allows the stock time for a natural correction. The remaining weak shareholders are worn out, leaving behind a solid foundation of strong owners who will be less apt to sell during the next advance.

## Characteristics Of The Handle

The handle represents the last shakeout before a stock takes off. After returning near the high of the cup, the stock will drift downward with lighter volume for at least one week. This steady movement down from the handle's start should generally be contained within 12%.

Also beware of a quick drop with a slow wedge up in price or simple sideways actions, both of which signal the absence of the needed shakeout.

Also, the handle area should develop above the 10-week moving average and in the upper half of the overall base.

The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) is the highest price in the handle. [Volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) should be at least 40% above average when this move happens.

## The Rapid7 Cup With Handle

**![rapid7](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IC112221-300x161.jpg)Rapid7** ([RPD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RPD)) made a new high on Sept 2, 2020, at 67.76. Just seven weeks later it bottomed at 57.73 and rebounded to 66.88, a depth of 15% **(1)**.

The following two weeks, the stock steadily came down 9% to 61.09 and volume followed suit, forming a handle **(2)**.

The week after, Rapid7 took off. Diving in on a daily chart, we can see that the stock did not break out until Nov. 5 **(3)**, having topped out right at 66.88 the day before. Once it did however, the stock began an eight-week run that would give shares a gain of more than 40%.

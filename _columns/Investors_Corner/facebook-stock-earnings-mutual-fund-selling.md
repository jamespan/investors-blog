When Facebook stock cratered nearly 19% on July 26, it was only matter of time before value investors asked the question: Is it OK to buy now?

The rationale was that at 175 a share, the valuation was much more attractive than when shares were trading around 218.

Keep in mind, though, when **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) stock was recently trading around 172, its trailing P-E ratio was 24. Its forward P-E, using the fiscal 2018 earnings-per-share estimate, was also 24. This may not seem an excessive valuation by any means. But it's still selling at a premium considering that growth rates are slowing. Full-year earnings are seen rising 18% this year and 16% in 2019.

## Facebook Stock: Uncertain Fundamentals

Buying a stock "on sale" when fundamentals are cloudy is risky.

The market clearly had it wrong with Facebook. The stock scored three straight all-time closing highs ahead of its [July 25 earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/facebook-second-quarter-results/). The message was that Wall Street was confident the company had put its data-scandal problems behind it and another strong quarter was in store.

But earnings growth decelerated for the second straight quarter. Q2 profit rose 32% from the year-ago quarter, but it marked a slowdown from a 63% jump in Q1 and 83% growth in Q4 of 2017. Sales rose 42% to \$13.23 billion, a slowdown from 49% growth in the first quarter. Quarterly after-tax margin shrank to 38.6% from 50.3% in the fourth quarter.

Facebook also warned of slowing sales in Q3 and Q4, raising fears of continued margin pressure.

## Facebook Stock: Institutional Selling

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IC1c080218-249x300.jpg)It's important to remember that [earnings growth](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/) fuels a stock's price performance. According to Zacks, third-quarter earnings are expected to fall 7% to \$1.48 a share. Sales are seen rising 34% to \$13.83 billion — still impressive growth, but a slowdown 42% growth in Q2.

It's also risky buying a stock amid signs of institutional selling. And there's been a lot of that recently. Institutional investors sold Facebook in spades when the former leader gapped below its 200-day moving average, as seen in a [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), on July 26. Facebook traded 169.8 million shares on that day compared with its average daily volume at the time of nearly 21 million shares. Two straight above-average volume declines after that were additional signs of institutional selling.

Another challenge for Facebook is that from an [institutional sponsorship](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/) standpoint, the stock is arguably over-owned. The thinking behind over-owned is that a stock tends to make the biggest move in the early stages of its business, when growth fund managers are building new positions.

But there comes a point where institutional ownership gets so large, it gets harder to move the share price. Renewed signs of institutional buying would improve Facebook's technical health, but fund managers could be on the sidelines for a while until earnings visibility improves.

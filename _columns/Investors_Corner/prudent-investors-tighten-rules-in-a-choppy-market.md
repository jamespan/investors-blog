In anticipation of high winds and rough seas, a prudent skipper takes certain precautions, wrote Charles Chapman in his classic reference, "Chapman Piloting & Seamanship."

  

Storms can be a tremendous test of knowledge, endurance, courage and good judgment, he wrote. A well-prepared craft and its crew are more likely to survive a storm.

  

And so it goes with turbulent spells in the stock market.

  

There is no one-size-fits-all rule to guide the many types and levels of investors through a volatile and uncertain market. But a number of rough guidelines can act as a sea anchor, to help give your portfolio and trading direction.

  

**1) Buy only in a market uptrend.** It's worth repeating this most basic rule to yourself. And buy only with extreme caution if the uptrend is under pressure or the market has been volatile.

  

**2) Keep your sell rules handy.** Know where your 7% to 8% loss stops are for each stock in your portfolio. Even better, trim your risk tolerance: Make your sell marks at 3% to 4%, rather than waiting for a 7% loss. You may get stopped out of a greater profit, but you spared your capital for the next round.

  

**3) Reel in your expectations.** If you generally shoot for 20% gains in an uptrending market, pull that target back to 10% to 15%, even less if the market gets too dicey. Two or three gains of 3% to 4% aren't a bad take in a tough market, either. And it beats watching a stock rise 12%, then diving to a loss before you have a chance to ax the rope and take profits.

  

**4) After you sell, keep your cash.** This is a hard and fast rule if the market is in correction. But if an uptrend is under pressure or reversing course regularly, consider parking your profit and waiting patiently for clearer, less risky opportunities.

  

**5) Follow rules very closely.** A choppy uptrend or an uptrend under pressure increases risk â€” it is no time to buy CAN SLIM-quality stocks in late-stage bases or cut corners on either fundamental or technical rules.

  

**6) Know your stocks.** A key reason for keeping your portfolio small and manageable is so you can stay on top of your stocks. When are earnings due for the company? What are analyst expectations? Are any stock splits or stock sales set to take effect? Are any lawsuits or federal decisions pending? These are factors that can trigger sell-off events, and for which investors should be on the lookout.

  

**7) Focus on the current market.** Listen to what it's telling you. If the market is not sending positive signals, listen up.

  

**8) Capitalize on market downtime.** Dive into a fresh search for rising leaders forming bases. Every correction is a breeding ground for new leadership and new bases.

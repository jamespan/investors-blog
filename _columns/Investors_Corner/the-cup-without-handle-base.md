Every once in a while, the traditional cup-type base doesn't form a handle.


IBD, in fact, has a special name for such a pattern. Can you guess? Oh, even your 5-year-old can. It's the cup without handle.


A cup with handle and cup without handle share a lot in common. Both, of course, have a curved, cuplike shape, as though the price bars formed a warm smile.


Both have a decline of no more than 30% to 33% â€” sometimes more during severe bear markets. The cup without handle can be as short as six weeks, while the cup with handle needs at least seven weeks of incubation.


The main difference is in the final stage of the pattern. The cup with handle includes a last shakeout before the breakout, in which the stock usually pulls back 8% to 12%. Or the decline can be less.


The cup without handle never has that washing away of the last weak shareholders. It never forms the handle. Instead, the stock shoots right up to new highs.


But for all their similarities, the cup without handle hasn't had the same success as its cousin.


IBD's proprietary research shows that the pantheon of winning stocks finds many more cup-with-handle bases than cups without handles. It's smart to conclude that the shakeout in the handle serves a useful purpose.


Nevertheless, a successful cup without handle should have the qualities of any outstanding base.


There should be more up weeks than down weeks in above-average volume; volume in the down weeks should be lighter, too. Tight price action is better than wide and loose behavior. The overall shape of the pattern should be somewhat symmetrical rather than lopsided. Finally, the breakout should have strong price and volume increases.


Last year, China's **Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) formed an eight-week cup **(1)**. Despite calm price action in the final week, there was no handle in the cup's base.


On May 6, the software firm shot out of its base, surging 8% past the 35 entry in volume 163% above its average **(2)**. The surge launched an advance that tripled the value of Qihoo shares until the stock started its next base in October.


The company had outstanding fundamentals. A decline in EPS for Q1 of 2013 was a problem, but it was largely due to an extremely tough year-over-year comparison. The next quarter, EPS surged 135%. Qihoo continued posting triple-digit profit gains.

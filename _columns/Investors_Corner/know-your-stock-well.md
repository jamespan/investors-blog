If you truly understand something, chances are that you'll be more committed to it. In the stock market, it helps to develop conviction in a stock. That way you won't sweat the small stuff and get scared out of a potential winner.

Nothing is more frustrating in [investing](http://education.investors.com/) than being shaken out of a stock, then watching it snap back and double from there â€” especially while you're still staying on the sidelines.

This situation happens to many investors. The key to avoiding it is to follow sound buy and sell rules and strive to truly understand a company's greatness.

In order to build conviction, you'll need to learn all you can about a stock's [fundamentals and technicals](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/761584-use-ibd-stock-checkup-to-check-health.htm). IBD and Investors.com offer many resources that can help you.

On the fundamental side, investors need to know exactly what products and services a company offers. Then ask yourself: Are the firm's offerings No. 1 or No. 2 in the marketplace? What are its competitive strengths and advantages? Does the company's industry offer big growth potential?

Investors can find these facts in IBD columns such as [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing/stock-spotlight.htm) and stories on the [New America](http://news.investors.com/business/new-america.htm) and Internet & Technology pages. To get additional insights, you could also turn to the company's own annual report and earnings releases for management's discussion and analysis.

Has the company produced higher earnings for at least three straight years? Be sure to check out its quarterly growth rates. Quarterly profit and sales growth should be up at least 25%.

Also, look for accelerating rates of increases and strong EPS and sales estimates.

On the technical side, evaluate the soundness of the stock's base. Is it in an early- or [late-stage pattern](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/757525-buy-early-not-late.htm)? Is price action tight and constructive, or is it wide and loose? Finally, what is the institutional picture? Are leading mutual funds and other money managers buying? Moving a stock takes big money.

Having a handle on these factors can help you hang on to shares and not be scared out when the market gets into a little trouble.

"Investors who can be right and sit tight are rare. It takes time for a stock to make a large gain," William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) has been a wild yet big winner in recent years.

The company has come a long way from just renting out DVDs by mail. It now offers streaming content as well as award-winning original programs.

In 2013, the company started a streak of triple-digit profit gains. In some quarters, sales growth was below 25% yet still solid. And the stock had many other positives. More mutual funds were heavily buying shares.

After a steep decline from its 2011 peak, the stock formed and broke out from a first-stage consolidation with a 28.36 entry in late April 2013. It soon settled into another consolidation **(1)** and staged another breakout in the week that ended July 12.

After a short pullback, Netflix surged for seven straight weeks.

It eventually reached a high of 55.65 in October before settling into another base **(2)**. At that point, the stock had nearly doubled.

Today, Netflix has joined the market leadership again. Its Composite Rating is 81.

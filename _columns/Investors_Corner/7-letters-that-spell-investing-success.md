In 1960, CAN SLIM had not yet been coined.


William J. O'Neil, then a broker, wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission to get the trading records of Jack Dreyfus. At that time Dreyfus was the nation's top fund manager.




O'Neil plotted Dreyfus' purchases on charts and discovered the No. 1 performer was not about "buy low and sell high."


Dreyfus was buying stocks as they broke out of bases to new highs. After the discovery, O'Neil — who later founded IBD in 1984 — made a 2,000% return in 26 months.


[The term CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) was first used in 1988 when O'Neil wrote "How to Make Money in Stocks."


How well does it work? In "The Successful Investor," O'Neil wrote, "Our internal money management group operating from our Data Analysis holding company produced a 1,356% net return in the five-year period ending June 2003." That's equivalent to roughly a 70% compound annual return.


Seven Letters
-------------


[CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) consists of seven elements common to the greatest winning stocks.


— C: Current quarterly earnings per share should be at least 25% growth over the year-ago quarter.


— A: Annual earnings should grow at least 25% over each of the past three years. The point here is that you want the best-performing companies over a long term. Other important fundamentals are an annual return on equity of at least 17%, sales growth of 25% or more in the most recent quarter, and profit margins among the best in its industry.


— N: New products, new management, new services or new industry conditions often lead to startling stock price gains. The N also stands for new price highs, as when a stock breaks out of a base.


— S: Share demand as revealed by huge increases in volume over the daily average as the stock rises.


— L: Leaders are always preferred over bottom dwellers. Look for high Relative Price Strength Ratings and focus mainly in top sectors or industry subgroups.


— I: Institutional sponsorship drives a winner upward. This is not about brokerage services' recommendations. It's about mutual funds, hedge funds and pension funds taking big positions in a stock. It's smart to pay attention to the top fund managers' picks.


— M: Market direction is absolutely essential. When the market is in a downtrend, three of every four stocks decline. When the market is in an uptrend, three of every four growth stocks advance. Sit out the bear markets in cash.

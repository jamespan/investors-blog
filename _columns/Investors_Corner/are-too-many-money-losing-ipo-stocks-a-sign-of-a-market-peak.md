In IBD Weekly, we note the supply of new issues hitting Wall Street in relation to the wider market. In recent years, it's been a good harvest for the investment banks, who earn plump fees for every company going public. But one may ask: Are there too many money-losing companies attracting desperate dollars today?


More important, does the recent jump in the number of newborn public firms signal a major top for the equities market?


As reported in the most recent issue of IBD Weekly, the number of new initial public offerings over the past 12 months as a percentage of stocks on the NYSE was 5.3%, near the 12-month high of 5.6% seen on May 18. (See the figures in the Psychological Market Indicators table on Page B6 of the current IBD Weekly.)


Both figures are still miles below the five-year high of 11% set on Aug. 8, 2014. After that peak, stocks skidded lower, but it wasn't bear-market style. The Nasdaq composite showed heavy distribution in the first couple of weeks of September that year, then staged a correction of nearly 11%, from 4610 on Sept. 3 to 4116 on Oct. 15. IBD changed its market outlook to "Market in correction" on Oct. 1. The Nasdaq also spent more than a week below its 200-day moving average.


Many veteran market observers would agree that, no, 2017 isn't exactly like 1999. Back then, scads of dot-com companies screamed to new highs despite having no earnings and tiny revenues. Pets.com used a sock puppet to promote itself on TV.



Remember TheGlobe.com, a community-focused website developer? It went public in November 1998 at 9 a share. On its first day of trade, the stock  hit as high as 97 before finishing at 63-1/2. (At that time U.S. stocks traded in fractions, not decimals.)


It was a ridiculous first-day move, reportedly the biggest of any IPO in history. TheGlobe crashed the next year.


Few of these "born on the back of a napkin" firms exist today. Yet one should be suspicious about the recent false rallies made by **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) and other tech companies that are bleeding a lot of red ink.


Snap hit an all-time low on Thursday, sinking more than 5% to 17 in heavy volume and matching its March 2 debut at 17 a share. The Snapchat site operator has impressive revenue, which has grown 1,255%, 666%, 406% and 286% vs. year-ago levels. The trailing 12-month revenue is \$515.4 million.



But it could be years for Snap to get into the black. Due to huge increases in operating expenses, the social network lost a whopping \$1.91 a share in the first quarter. Snap has 1.16 billion shares outstanding.


**Okta** ([OKTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OKTA)), **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)), **Alteryx** ([AYX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYX)) and **MuleSoft** ([MULE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MULE)) also are losing money, and the recent dives by these stocks point to the added risk of buying a stock that does not have a price-to-earnings ratio because there are no earnings.


Okta's June 8 breakout past a 27 IPO base entry failed the next session. The San Francisco-based firm and member of IBD's internet content industry group is expected to lose \$1.13 a share in the fiscal year ending in January. Coupa has done a round trip of an 18% gain after clearing a 31.90 entry on May 11.



Analysts see **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)), which was profitable in the past few quarters, posting a net loss of 19 cents a share this year and shrinking its loss to 4 cents in 2018.


Of course, some, maybe even all, of these firms may eventually turn a profit. They may post quarterly results next month or in August that surprise the Street and change the perception about their road to profitability.


Yet with thousands of investment merchandise available on Wall Street, as an individual investor you can find plenty of great stocks that already are posting large profits and are poised to increase them.


"Microsoft's annual earnings growth rate was 99% at the point it took off in 1986, and Cisco Systems' was 57% in 1990," wrote Bill O'Neil, chairman and founder of IBD, in "24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success." "Price Co.'s annual earnings growth rate showed 90%."


"These leaders also displayed a strong return on equity and healthy pretax profit margins. The ROEs of Microsoft, Home Depot and Cisco Systems were 40%, 28% and 36%, respectively, and Microsoft and Cisco Systems both had pretax profit margins of 33%."


"All of this happened *before* they went on to make their biggest price increases during the 1990s. My rule of thumb is: Look for stocks with annual earnings growth rates of 30% or more and ROEs of 17% or higher," O'Neil wrote.

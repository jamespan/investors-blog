IPOs can provide a wild ride. The individual investor who hopes to play an initial public offering has to take the wildness into account.


If a stock is low-priced and thinly traded, then the patient investor will give it some time to grow up. IBD often does likewise. Just because a stock is small doesn't mean it will someday be big.


Chip designer **Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) debuted on the market Oct. 10, 2012. The stock satisfied the N in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749), which stands for new products. Ambarella was a designer of chips for high-definition cameras, surveillance cameras and wearable cameras including GoPro sports cameras.


IBD first alerted readers in the New High list column Dec. 31, 2012; the Big Picture on March 8, 2013; and in a New America article March 25, 2013.


Why the slow rollout?


Ambarella wasn’t the sort of stock that big funds would’ve jumped into in 2012. The IPO price was \$6 a share. Volume was thin. Disciplined investors would’ve regarded it as a low-probability play.


Sometimes a thin stock, with a lot stacked against it, will succeed. Odds-focused investors accept that reality. Missing a few winners is a good trade-off when the odds let investors avoid many more losers.

Volume on the breakout was 295,200. Daily dollar volume was \$2.1 million, too small for funds. And the general market was in correction mode.


Despite all the negatives, the stock advanced 93% in less than three months.


When a low-probability stock works, savvy investors stick to their rules.


Ambarella then formed a base and broke out on March 8, 2013, clearing a 13.52 buy point. The stock was still thin. Daily dollar volume was \$2.5 million, still too small for funds. This time the breakout failed. Ambarella triggered the 8% sell rule on March 12, two trading days after the breakout.


Ambarella retook the buy point in late March in strong volume. The stock triggered the 8% sell rule in mid-April.


A new cup-shaped pattern formed and Ambarella moved past a 16.10 entry point in late May 2013. Daily dollar volume was now more than \$10 million, an improvement but still too thin. The stock triggered the 8% sell rule two days after the breakout.


Notice what happened: The disciplined investor missed three 8% losses by following the rules.


Ambarella next formed a cup-with-handle with an 18.45 buy point. (The handle was easiest to see on the daily chart.) Daily dollar volume was now \$22 million, which provided decent liquidity. The patient investor could buy now.


During the construction of this new base and the breakout on Sept. 25, weekly volume showed strong increases during the stock's upside, a positive sign **(2)**. The stock's RS line reached into new high ground.After a brief pullback of less than 5%, Ambarella sailed 98% in a little more than three months.

*Fifteenth In A Series*

  

A free-market economy and IBD's investment approach have something in common.

  

The economy is comprised of millions of consumers and businesses making billions of decisions. No central planner, no matter how well-educated, can get a grip on enough of that diffused and fast-changing knowledge to offer intelligent guidance.

  

That's why central planning inevitably fails. Yet a free market can easily dispose of, or at least shrink, incompetent businesses while rewarding sound ventures.

  

What does this have in common with IBD's investment approach?

  

You have the same choice. You can manage your portfolio like a central planner convinced that you know more than the market, or you can let the market itself guide you.

  

Much of IBD's message revolves around listening to the stock market and reacting accordingly. It isn't about coming up with the right idea or predicting the future.

  

IBD-style investors and free-market economists share something else. They operate in a world of humility. Meanwhile, the central-planner types tend to go on a delusional, "we know best" ego trip.

  

Humility is essential because no one knows when a falling stock will bottom. And no one knows the market's next move.

  

This is where Rule No. 15 comes in: "Don't try to bottom guess or buy on the way down. Never argue with the market. Forget your pride and ego."

  

Let's break down Rule No. 15 into its pieces.

  

• **Don't try to bottom guess**: The disciplined investor knows this is folly. Suppose you go to a baseball game and your favorite player is in a slump. Would you be willing to bet thousands of dollars on what day his slump will end? Probably not. Picking the low of a stock or the low of the market isn't any easier.

  

• **Don't buy on the way down**: This is especially dangerous if you're buying additional shares. You don't want to risk becoming a long-term investor by default. You could end up with a huge position in a stock-market loser.

  

• **Never argue with the market**: Arguments are about who's right. But the market isn't about right, it's about might — the might of institutional buying, selling and holding. Arguing with the trend is silly. It's like refusing to dive out of the way of an oncoming truck because the pedestrian has the right of way.

  

• **Forget your pride and ego**: A company might be impressed with the resume that describes your last job as "plant manager" — when all you did was pull weeds. Your wife might indulge your beer-inspired claim that you could coach Notre Dame's football team better from your sofa than the coach can from the sidelines. But the market isn't going to indulge your delusional ideas about investing.

  

Now let's reverse the thrust of Rule No. 15: You should wait for a stock to show a prior uptrend and a sound base before buying. You should buy on the way up, letting the stock prove itself. You should be a realist: Let the market shape your views. You should be humble and quick to admit and eliminate mistakes.

  

The best investors are listeners. They listen to what the market and the price and volume action of their stocks are telling them. If you learn to do that, you will prosper. But if you can't let go of your ego, perhaps you should stick to coaching football from your sofa and stay out of the market.

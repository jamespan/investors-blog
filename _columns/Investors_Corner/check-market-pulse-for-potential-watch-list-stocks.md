IBD features leading stocks on its pages each day in the New America, Internet & Technology and markets columns, among others.

But what if you're running short on time and hope to jot down a few potential watch-list candidates for later research?

No worries. There are plenty of quick-hit options where you can still find great stock ideas. You can then circle back to them when you have more time.

Stocks On The Move, IBD's Screen Of The Day and Your Weekly Review are three of the many places where investors may uncover hidden gems. Investor's Corner will feature each of these and more in the next seven columns.

Today, we'll kick off the series with what may seem a less-obvious place for ideas: the Market Pulse table.

The table, which accompanies the daily Big Picture column (today on Page B2), may be small, but it's packed with valuable information for investors.

The leaders up in volume and leaders down in volume sections list information on just that — leading stocks that made big moves during that day's trading session. The names in these sections are some that investors should pay attention to.

A top stock that is breaking out, for instance, will show up on leaders up in volume — if its advance is in heavy turnover. A breakout that occurs in light trade is more prone to fail.

Or if a leader jumps on an upside earnings surprise or other positive news, it'll likely make the cut.

The downside list is equally important. If a leader shows up here, you might want to dig deeper to find out why. Is there a fundamental or technical change that triggers a sell signal for current shareholders? Or did the stock pare its losses to close in the top half of its intraday price range in above-average volume, which could signal support?

Regardless of which section it lands in, it may be worth a closer look by virtue of its inclusion. So even if you have only a few minutes to scan for ideas, you're sure to find a handful of candidates on the daily volume lists.

Then, conduct your due diligence on the stocks when you have more time on your hands. View their action on daily and weekly stock charts, and check their fundamentals and recent news.

The Market Pulse also gives a brief summary of the day's market action, as well as the current market outlook.

The outlook tells you if the market is in a confirmed uptrend, under pressure or in a correction.

The market environment is crucial to successful investing. Since three of four stocks will eventually follow the market's trend, you want to be sure you're swimming with the tide — not against it.

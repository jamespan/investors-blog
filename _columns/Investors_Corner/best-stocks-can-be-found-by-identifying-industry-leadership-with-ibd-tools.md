  Best Stocks Can Be Found By Identifying Industry Leadership With IBD Tools

One of the key aspects of the CAN SLIM strategy is just how much of a leader is a stock you're thinking of buying. In other words, does it fit into the L (for Leadership) in [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/)? How do you find the best stocks in the leading industries?




The short answer is, look at the stock's rank within its industry group, and the ranking of the industry group itself.


IBD tracks an exhaustive list of 197 industry groups. Homebuilders, online retailers, chipmakers and biotechs are all examples of industry groups. These are collections of companies that tend to have related products, services or similar markets.


The "L" in CAN SLIM is all about choosing the leaders. "You should buy the really great companies — those that lead their industries and are number one in their particular fields," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote in his book, "How to Make Money in Stocks."


An industry group usually represents a segment of the economy. When large flows of investor capital move into that portion of the economy, it typically drives that group of stocks higher vs. others. Rankings are based on six-month price performance. The ranking is updated [every day](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-oct-26-2022/) in Investors.com and MarketSmith.


Best Stocks Rank High In Top-Ranked Industries
----------------------------------------------


If you watch the IBD's industry group rankings closely enough, try to catch moves early and identify the strongest stocks in that industry. This will give you a clear advantage in taking action near the onset of an industry rally.


The majority of leading stocks generally rise from leading industries. IBD research shows that almost half of a leading stock's price movement is directly tied to the performance of the stock's industry group or the strength of the overall sector.


Some industries are broader in scope, so we break them down into their own niche areas. For example, chip companies fall into chip equipment makers, chipmakers or chip designers. All three chip groups have struggled lately.


Decades of research finds that winning stocks tend to be the No. 1 or No. 2 stock in leading industry groups. Sounds like a lot of work to determine that, but [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-adobe-inc-adbe.aspx) does the calculation for you. Look up any stock on this tool, and it will tell you the top few leaders in the group based on IBD ratings. A few groups could have multiple leaders.


Generally, leading stocks are also in the top five or six sectors.


On [MarketSmith,](https://marketsmith.investors.com/ms-platform/?src=APA1BQ) the Industry & Sector tab lists rankings for the group and the stock's spot within the group.


For example, if you were to look up **Enphase Energy** ([ENPH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENPH)) on Wednesday you would immediately notice that it was ranked No. 1 in the solar energy group by Composite, EPS and [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/), and the group itself was ranked No. 2.


Most of the time, the best-performing stocks are in the top 40 groups, and that's where you should concentrate your research. It is also important to watch the groups that are rising in ranking. And if a group starts falling in rank, use that as a warning about the group's leading stocks.


Best Stocks May Touch Related Areas
-----------------------------------


Some stocks also overlap industry groups. For example, **Cross Country Healthcare** ([CCRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCRN)), which provides staffing services for hospitals and clinics, is in the commercial services-staffing industry group. The company is ranked No. 1 and the industry group is ranked No. 88, which has moved up from No. 101  a week ago and from 126 four weeks ago and from 168 seven weeks ago.


Meanwhile, the hospital group that Cross Country Healthcare serves has also been moving up, to No. 138 as of Wednesday from 186 four weeks ago.


Investors who trade ETFs can use industry group and sector data to make picks. This is a good strategy when a group performs well but there are no great leaders in it.


This year, for example, most oil stocks have outperformed the S&P but some industry groups within the broader energy sector have been volatile. One industry group that has gained in strength lately has been the oil & gas field services group.


Investors who want to add this sector to their portfolios can access those stocks by using an ETF like SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment and Services ETF ([XES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XES)) or iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services ETF ([IEZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IEZ)).

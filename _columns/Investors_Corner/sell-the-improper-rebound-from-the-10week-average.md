By now you know how to buy a stock on a rebound from its 50-day or 10-week moving average. Today we'll look at the rebound as a chance to sell.

Almost certainly we aren't talking about the same kind of rebound. The buyable bounce is attractive: Volume is soft on the way down and then picks up as the stock makes its launch from the 50-day line. If you're an experienced trader, you've likely caught some good stocks that way. But if the stock fell to the 50-day line with heavy volume, you may be looking at a problem.

If that same stock then bounces off the 50-day line, you may feel better about it â€” until you notice that volume on the way up is a shadow of that seen on the way down. A high-volume decline to or below the 50-day moving average followed by a weak low-volume rise is your chance to sell.

Now let's make it more interesting. You already own this stock and have a fat gain in the position. Your miracle stock makes a peak and beats a hasty retreat. No problem, you say to yourself, your entry is well protected.

But this retreat is disconcerting: It includes some of the heaviest volume of the entire run. Uh oh. The next thing you know it's hitting the 50-day line. It bounces. You feel better. And then you see the bounce has low volume.

Look at what happened to **China Mobile** ([CHL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHL)) in 2007-08. China's biggest wireless provider had been on a tear for several years, a familiar name on the then-IBD 100 during every uptrend.

After these massive gains, China Mobile put in what would become its ultimate top on Oct. 29, 2007. That new high appears with low volume **1**, your first sign of worry. The ensuing decline to pierce the 50-day line shows heavy volume **2**.

China Mobile regains the 50-day Nov. 28, but volume is a shadow of that seen during the sell-off **3**.

The stock begins to slide again, this time with no big volume like before. Yet the action is now becoming choppy, a bad sign. Maybe you're lulled by the quiet volume as it dips. Maybe you're waiting for another base to form.

But the offense-type sell signals had already appeared: A huge, long-term advance, a climax top in October, low-volume new highs and a high-volume sell-off. Finally, another early sell opportunity appeared between Nov. 23 and Dec. 6, as China Mobile rebounded from its 50-day line in thin trade. By October 2008, it fell 67% from its 104 peak.

It's important to figure out where institutional investors are putting their cash. In the long run, they have the power to drive a stock's price up or down.

Stocks whose weekly chart shows more accumulation (an up week in price in above-average volume) than distribution (down week in above-average volume) should be watched closely. Such big-volume up weeks are signs that major funds are buying.

Conversely, stocks whose bases show more weeks of distribution than accumulation should be avoided because they indicate funds are selling hard.

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) started shaping a cup-with-handle base in April. The left side of the base showed only one week of accumulation **1** and two weeks of distribution **2**, with the stock closing both weeks in the lower 40% of its range.

The last point is important, because a down week in above-average volume can actually be considered an accumulation week if the stock ends in the upper 60% of its trading range. That's because the stock has come well off its lows, indicating that institutional investors are still behind it.

Apple closed near the lows in both distribution weeks. Another problem with the base was that volume failed to pick up as the stock climbed the base's right side. In total, the base garnered three distribution weeks vs. one accumulation week, a red flag.

Apple cleared the 619.97 entry Aug. 6. **3** It rose 14% to a new high of 705.07 on Sept. 21 before heading south. By Oct. 19, the stock had undercut its buy point, and by Nov. 16 it had fallen to 505.75, **4** 28% off the peak and 18% below the buy point.

One could definitely argue that Apple would have yielded a big enough gain for traders who bought correctly and exited the stock before it did a round trip. But the stock also failed to rise 20%-25% from the breakout, the normal objective of the IBD trading system.

Such is the fate of many bases where distribution exceeds accumulation. Some may clear their buy points and climb a bit; others break down more quickly.

When there's no clear winner in the battle of accumulation vs. distribution, look at the week in the base with the highest volume. Did the stock rise, fall yet find support, or sell off hard? In Apple's case, the biggest volume came in a down week in which it closed in the bottom 40% of its range.

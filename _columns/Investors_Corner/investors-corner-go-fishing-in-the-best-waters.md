*Fourteenth In A Series*

  

Have you ever talked to avid fishermen? The first thing they talk about is where you'll find the best fishing. 

  

As you fish for great stocks, you're casting your hook in search of those precious few that could be the market's next superstars. You can do wonders for your portfolio by focusing on the best waters.

  

You want the best groups. IBD can help you find the highest-quality stocks in the strongest sectors. The 197 industries tracked by IBD appear each day on How's The Market?.

  

Try to stick to the top 40 groups for the best results. Even better, zero in on the top 20. Put another way, just go look for great stocks. If you proceed correctly, your research will almost certainly lead to the better groups.

  

Look at your current watch list and portfolio. Do you have any stocks from the Building-Residential group? Probably not. It was ranked 187th as of Tuesday's IBD.

  

There always will be outliers. Great stocks can appear in mediocre groups. But a poor group is a big negative for any stock.

  

Also, IBD's daily stock tables appear first by sector — the strongest first, the weakest last — then alphabetically within that sector. IBD highlights the sector leaders at the top of each sector's listings. You'll notice more stocks are highlighted in the strongest sectors than in the weakest. That makes sense. Even the best stocks of a poor sector often don't make the grade.

  

Let's look at the listings in the Sept. 1, 2010, paper, the day the market confirmed a new uptrend.

  

You just decided to focus on the first five or 10 highlighted stocks in the best sectors.

  

You would have bought **Riverbed Technology** ([RVBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVBD)) at 21 in mid-October, as it tested the 10-week moving average. It peaked at 44.70 in March. You'd have hooked shares of **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)) from a square-box base on Sept. 20. From its 20.09 buy point, it soared to 30.35 in five months.

  

You might have bought **Warner Chilcott** ([WCRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WCRX)) when it neared its 10-week line in the Oct. 8 week. That wouldn't have worked out so well. But your overall catch would have been appetizing.

  Stalling In Indexes Is Sign Of Institutional Selling

Skilled market watchers can tell when the major indexes are weakening, even when they are rising in price.


Specifically, they look for stalling â€” days when a major index climbs for the session in heavy volume but closes low in the day's price range. This suggests underlying weakness.


Just like an airplane stalls when its engine thrust is not enough to sustain the angle of ascent, the market stalls when it rises but closes near the lowest prices of the session.


In this scenario, institutional buyers are unwilling to keep committing themselves into the closing bell, and may be taking advantage of market strength to dump stocks. It's an insidious form of institutional selling, leaving a signature on the chart that is difficult to spot.


The most common way the market shows that institutional investors are selling heavily is when a major index falls significantly in higher volume. That's called a [distribution day](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/658035-institutional-selling-flags-stock-market-tops.htm).


Stalling usually counts just as another distribution day. So they need to be weighed with regular distribution days when trying to judge a market top.


The possible combinations of price and volume that can be considered stalling are too complex to discuss in this column. But basically, the technical definition of stalling is when an index hits a new high or comes close to one, and volume increases from the previous day.


Just before its March 2012 peak, the Nasdaq climbed to an intraday high but closed in the lower 30% of the daily range, for a minimal gain. **(1)** Volume edged higher. It was one of the several distribution days that signaled the top. The Nasdaq fell 13% over the next 2-1/2 months from its 3134.17 peak.


In January, another subtle example of stalling occurred when the composite inched up less than 0.1% in higher trade.  **(2)** The index came close to making a new high but closed in the lower half of its daily range.


While every instance of stalling is hard to spot, rest assured that IBD market writers point them out in [The Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) and its accompanying Market Pulse.


Readers who want to learn all the intricacies of stalling and of market topping and bottoming signals may consider attending the IBD [Market School](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing/?nav=IBDUWorkshops). This full-day workshop discusses all manner of distribution and follow-through characteristics.

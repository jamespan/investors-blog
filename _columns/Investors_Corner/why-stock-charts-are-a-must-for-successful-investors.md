  Why Learning To Use Stock Charts Is A Must For Successful Investors

Doctors use stethoscopes, machines to analyze blood and urine samples, MRI scanners and other diagnostic machines to see what's wrong with patients. These devices are all part of the profession of medicine.


When you invest in stocks, you also need to use the right tools.


"Investors who train themselves to decode price movements on charts properly have an enormous advantage over those who either refuse to learn, just don't know any better, or are a bit lazy," wrote IBD Chairman William O'Neil in "How To Make Money In Stocks."


While charts can be intimidating at first, with time and practice, you can learn how to properly interpret price and volume action on a daily and weekly basis. You will learn to recognize healthy and constructive action, as well as warning signals.


Monthly charts can help you too. How? In some cases, you can easily count the number of bases that a true market leader has formed over a lengthy time period. The more bases a good stock forms before breaking out to new highs, the higher the chances that an end in the stock's growth cycle is near.


Also, IBD has studied the best market winners during various bull cycles going back to the late 1800s and has found that many winners run for several years before going into a deep freeze in price. You just cannot gain that perspective from a daily chart.


Monthly charts may also help you quickly identify a sharp break in a long-term downtrend in price, giving you a clue to be looking for a new base to form and a potential breakout to materialize.


Learning to use charts is a must for investors who implement IBD's seven-step comprehensive methodology for selecting, buying and selling stocks, coined by O'Neil as [CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). While fundamentals are important, they don't tell you when to buy and sell. Charts can help you truly pinpoint your stock selection and timing.


[IBD charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), available within the "Research" section at Investors.com, shows price and volume action for an individual stock, exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a market index such as the Nasdaq composite or S&P 500.


Prices are usually shown on the upper part on a chart, while volume — the number of shares traded — tends to lie below.


The most popular is a bar chart, where each vertical line (or bar) represents trading activity for a certain time frame. Charts show action on a daily, weekly, monthly or even intraday basis.


![ic_flt_113016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IC_flt_113016-1024x501.png)On a daily chart, the highest point on the bar shows the highest price traded for the day **(1)**, as seen in this sample chart from **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)), a  superb winner from its breakout on Aug. 9, 2012; by November 2014, the fuel card expert for the trucking industry rolled 309% higher.


The lowest tip of the bar shows the lowest price traded that day **(2)**. The horizontal hash mark show the closing price **(3)**. Some bars show a left-side hash mark indicating the opening price of a stock. For investing the IBD way, however, that information is not critical. The price close is far more important.


Notice on FleetCor's chart that a solid black line runs across the bars that show the amount of volume traded in the stock each day. This line, calculated by taking the total volume over the 50 most recent trading sessions and dividing by 50, gives you a quick read on whether trading was heavy or light on any given session.


Why care about that?


In most cases, a good stock will show volume surge well above its 50-day average on the day of its breakout, or in the days and weeks soon afterward. Such spikes in price present you the fact that some large fund managers are urgently buying shares. Institutional buying over weeks or months is the secret sauce that makes breakouts to new highs the way to make money in stocks.


Line charts only have a line connecting the closing prices. Candlestick charts, which originated in Japan, show relationships among the open, high, low and close of stock and index prices in a different visual format. Meanwhile, point and figure charts don't have a volume element. You don't need to use these additional types of charts to do well with IBD. Keep it simple.


Once again, to see stock charts on Investors.com, hover your cursor over the Research tab, then click on "IBD Charts."


Stocks will form bases or price patterns, which are your buy setups. But there are certain nuances in price and volume that make a base buyable or one that you should avoid. Investor's Corner is geared to help you learn the subtle differences between a good base pattern and a faulty one.

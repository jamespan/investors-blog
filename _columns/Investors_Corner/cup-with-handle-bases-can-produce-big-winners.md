The cup-with-handle base has produced many of the stock market's biggest winners.

The chart pattern forms after a stock hits a 52-week high and then pulls back as much as 30% to 35% before climbing the right side of the pattern. The cup should have a smooth, rounded shape as it makes its way back up toward the previous high.

In many cases, the stock will again drift downward before reaching the prior high, but no more than 8% to 12%. This adds a handle to the cup. In fact, the pattern -- which takes at least seven weeks to form -- should look like a teacup viewed from its side.

The pullback that shapes the handle should occur in mild volume as the last of the weak holders exit the stock, feeling lucky to escape with just a small loss or gain after sitting through the cup's long, steep correction. At the same time, it's not uncommon to see a shakeout in the handle, in which volume spikes as investors quickly bail out.

The handle is important because it sets the stage for the stock's breakout to new highs. The buy point is the high of the handle, plus 10 cents.

**Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)), one of the big winners before the market crashed in 2008, broke out above a 33.41 cup-with-handle buy point on Sept. 20, 2006. That buy point is adjusted for a 3-for-1 split that occurred in June 2007. Volume on the breakout was 40% above average, exactly what you want to see.

The fertilizer play fell five weeks in a row in forming the left side. That's normal action. Volume was only moderately above average in a few of those weeks.

Notice how volume surged 70% above its 10-week average as Potash rallied more than 9% in the week ended July 28 **(1)**. That's a clue institutional investors were accumulating shares with conviction.

The base showed more positive elements. One, the bottom of the cup shows an upside reversal in above-average volume on the weekly chart **(2)**. Two, the handle drifted lower in mild volume. And three, the stock's relative strength line was hitting new highs as it headed toward its breakout.

IBD Market Pulse showed that the stock market was in a confirmed uptrend when Potash broke out, giving investors the green light to buy top-rated stocks that were clearing buy points in strong turnover.

Potash at the time had a respectable 84 Composite Rating as the Canadian company benefited from soaring demand for fertilizers needed to meet strong global demand for food and biofuels such as ethanol.

Potash climbed along its sharply rising 10-week moving average, hitting a peak of 241.62 in the week ended June 20, 2008. It was a gain of 722% in just one year.

Of course, breakouts from cup-with-handle bases don't always guarantee success. Even the strongest stocks can easily get derailed by a market correction. Potash ended up losing 80% of its value as the market crashed later in 2008.

Beware of cup bases that show too many wild daily or weekly price swings, creating a choppy or jagged pattern. Such poorly formed bases are a sign of weakness.

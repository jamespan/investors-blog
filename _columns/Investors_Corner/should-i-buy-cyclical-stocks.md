Leading stocks look scary to some individual investors. Laggards, though, make these same investors feel safe. Often it's inexperienced investors who think this way.

Why is this so?

The allure of laggards is built on a cyclical theory. The idea is that what goes down must come up. Likewise, the fear of leaders also revolves around a cyclical idea: What goes up must come down.

If the individual investor is buying cyclical stocks, there probably is some truth to these notions.

Sometimes inexperienced investors don't know if they are buying a cyclical stock or a growth stock. Perhaps they don't think in those terms. They think the entire universe of stocks operates cyclically. Don't gravity and rebounds explain it all?

But the stock market doesn't operate that way universally â€” at least not in any time frame that you would like to sit through.

Consider an observation from IBD founder William J. O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

"Rallies in cyclical stocks may tend to be more short-lived and prone to falter at the first hint of a recession or an earnings slowdown," O'Neil writes.

While a quality growth stock may rise in multistages, cyclicals rarely deliver the long, multistage run.

Let's look at a cyclical stock such as RV maker **Winnebago Industries** ([WGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WGO)) from April 2003 to December 2007.

RV stocks are often good gainers early in an economic rebound. Expensive, discretionary purchases aren't made unless consumer confidence is high or at least rising.

Beginning in April 2003, note how Winnebago rose nicely for about 10 months **(1)** and then stalled out and eventually sagged back to roughly where it began **(2)**. That's classic cyclical action.

The cyclical stock demands excellent timing. If the investor buys too early, he or she could be riding the stock down and waiting a long time for an upturn.

If the investor gets greedy and holds too long, he or she could cycle into a mediocre gain or even a loss.

Growth stocks, though, don't necessarily follow that pattern. A leading growth stock is often riding a wave of new products. Look at **Apple's** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) monthly chart from April 2003 to December 2007.

There is absolutely nothing cyclical about Apple's move. Yes, growth stocks suffer pullbacks that can be severe. However, a quality growth stock will rarely return to the start of the whole move.

And therein lies the difference.

A cyclical stock might leave the train station, do a loop route, and return to the same place where it started.

True growth stocks leave the train station and climb higher and longer than any cyclical theory would predict.

If an investor finds himself or herself feeling safe with laggards and fearful of leaders, maybe it's time to step back and ask what kind of stocks he or she is buying.

Successful investors always know what they are buying and what can be expected. A cyclical stock must be played differently than a growth stock.

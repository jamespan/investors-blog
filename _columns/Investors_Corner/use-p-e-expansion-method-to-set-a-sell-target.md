For more than a century, analysts have used price-to-earnings ratios to judge whether a stock is over- or underpriced. They regularly downgrade stocks that outrun the P-E range of their industry peers.


But research shows such valuations to be flawed. Leading stocks typically ignore rank-and-file averages to climb well beyond the P-E limits of their peers.


For a growth investor, the ratio — which is simply a stock's current share price divided by its annual earnings per share — is better used as a price projection tool.


The idea is this: Choose a leading stock based on fundamentals; time your buy according to its chart pattern; and get an idea of where your stock is headed by projecting a price target using the stock's P-E ratio at the time of the breakout.


Credit card payment processor **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), for example, had a P-E ratio of 24.4 when it broke out of a seven-week flat base in August 2006, just after its IPO **1**.


The base's buy point was 50.73. The stock's EPS over the prior four quarters was \$2.08. Divide the price (50.73) by the earnings (2.08) to find the P-E ratio (24.4).


To turn that into a price target, you must determine the stock's potential for P-E expansion. Research shows that leading stocks during bull markets typically expand their P-Es by 130%, or 2.3 times.


So multiply that number (2.3) by the P-E ratio (24.4). The result is 56.


Hang in there, you're almost done.


MasterCard's consensus EPS estimate for the next year, 2007, was \$3.19. Multiply 3.19 by the expanded P-E number (56) and you get a price target of 178.64.


That number isn't gospel. The market could change or the company could miss earnings views. But in general you have a navigational tool that says this stock has legs.


In MasterCard's case, those legs climbed 114% in the 17 weeks after its breakout **2**. The stock then formed a seven-week cup **3**.


It topped the cup's buy point in feeble volume, then dived to its 10-week line on Feb. 9 **4**.


The stock slipped into another consolidation. As it sagged below 10-week support over the next few weeks, The Big Picture column's market status shifted from uptrend to market in correction.


At this point, the stock had been static for three months. Investors who hitched on at the initial breakout were sitting on more than a 100% gain. It would be easy to close up shop and call it a good day. But the price target says the stock could have another 50% gain in its tank. It advises you to sit tight, unless the stock shows signs of deterioration.


On March 21 the market logged a follow-through day, shifting the status back to a confirmed rally. MasterCard flat-lined, eventually forming a shallow cup with handle. The stock cleared a 112.42 buy point April 27 in big trade **5**.


In the next 11 weeks, MasterCard rose 55% to 174.60. But the stock also flashed signs of stalling as it made new highs in heavy volume on July 13 **6**. This time, when MasterCard pulled back to its 10-week line, the 178.64 target alerted investors to look for sell signals.


The stock held support through July, then sheared its 10-week moving average on Aug. 1, when nearly 13 million shares changed hands.


The new issue had logged a 244% gain and come within 2% of the price target calculated at its initial breakout.

Finding winning stocks poised in pre-sprint mode is not a push-button business. Savvy investors don't rely on any one indicator or tool to say "Buy this, now."


Trust, as the former President Ronald Reagan said, but verify.


![IC-081016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IC-081016-1024x863.jpg)Even a top-grade stock must meet all the requirements of a sound investment method before you deploy hard-earned cash. It has to make sense according to what you know about industry leadership, chart analysis and the state of the market.


So a broad-based measure, such as IBD's Composite Rating, provides a solid starting point. But keep in mind, it is a starting point only.


Introduced on Jan. 31, 2001, Composite Ratings have been flagging top stocks for more than a decade. They are an immense time saver. But don't assume every stock bearing a high Composite rank is ready for purchase.


Composite Ratings digest a bundle of IBD SmartSelect Ratings, including EPS Ratings, Relative Price Strength Ratings, SMR Ratings and Accumulation-Distribution grades, into a single, 99 (best) to 1 (worst) scale.

The rating also crunches data for how far a stock is off its 52-week high. The closer to the high, all else being equal, the higher the grade. This factor gets added weight in the stock's rating.


Investors trying to determine whether stocks with high Composite Rating are leaders should always start with two basic technical metrics: stock price and average daily trading volume.


In the biomedical and biotech industry group, for example, **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) and **SciClone Pharmaceuticals** ([SCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCLN)) both held the best-possible Composite Rating of 99 back in June 2012. Which was the better-quality stock?


Both showed strong fundamentals and interesting chart patterns. Both also traded at healthy average daily volumes, above 400,000 shares a day each. But Alexion traded above 90. SciClone had yet to hit 7 a share -- below IBD's 10 minimum for leading stocks.


Let's view another pair. **Anika Therapeutics** ([ANIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANIK)) and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) each held a 98 Composite. Again, the rating has guided us to stocks with compelling fundamentals. Pricewise, both were also loosely in target range, although Vertex, near 57, looked stronger than Anika, which traded below 15.


The kicker here is average daily trading volume. Anika traded a scant 168,000 shares a day at the time. Vertex saw more than 4 million shares change hands in each trading session. This is a sign of large institutions at work, which is a vital element to great runs by the true market leaders.

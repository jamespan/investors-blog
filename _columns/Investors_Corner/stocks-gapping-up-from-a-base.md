A smile crosses your face as you log on one morning before the open. Your company has just reported blow-out earnings. The stock is up sharply in pre-market trading. This is your moment. The stock is going to break out at the open, and you're going to jump aboard.

But wait. Your smile disappears as the opening bell sounds. The stock opens 15% above its [cup buy point](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/746319-how-to-buy-cup-bases.htm). You're terrified.

What's the right thing to do? Buy it without hesitation.

Normally, we're told not to chase stocks that are extended more than 5% from a proper buy point. Gaps are exceptions. As dangerous as it sounds, they often show great potential to be a big winner over time.

A gap occurs when a stock opens higher than the high of the previous trading session. It's sometimes called a breakaway gap when the stock is breaking out of a base, beginning a major move upward.

Before you buy such a stock, however, confirm that it truly has the potential to be a big winner.

The company's earnings-per-share growth must be impressive. Do enough research to confirm that the company's hot new products are industry game changers.

Also, make sure that the overall stock market is in a [confirmed uptrend](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764&nav=IBDUCourse3). Best of all, the stock has set up in a picture-perfect cup-with-handle base that looks like it's right out of IBD's [Model Book of Greatest Stock Market Winners](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/model-stock/?src=A011BMT).

Take the example of Research In Motion, now known as **BlackBerry** ([BBRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBRY)), in December 2003. The Canada-based company made an early version of a smartphone that was popular with business people who spent time out of the office. RIM, as the company was known, was expanding fast into the consumer market.

The base in which the stock set up had elements of a sound flat base. It lasted six weeks and corrected less than 7%. But it also had a brief peak that carried it to a new high in the fourth week **(1)**.

The base had elements of a [high, tight flag](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/690485-breaking-down-the-high-tight-flag.htm). Before making the flagpole, it gained 109%, but took 14 weeks to do so **(2)**, a bit longer than most high tight flags, in which the pole is created in four to eight weeks.

The stock also pulled back to its 50-day moving average in light volume, where it found support.

At the time, the stock had a Composite Rating of 93, an EPS Rating of 73 and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 94. Following the breakout, the Composite rose to 97, the EPS to 81 and the RS to 98.

Following its earnings report, RIM opened up in the morning about 26% above the prior day's close, creating a huge gap. If you bought near the low of the day, you would have had a 20% profit by the end of the day. It doesn't always work that smoothly. Some stocks gap up, pull back in the morning and advance later in the day.

The next week, the stock created a [short stroke](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/704490-apple-short-stroke-taking-profit.htm), a bullish formation that would have allowed an investor to buy there.

From the gap up, the stock advanced for a year, building two more bases in the meantime before dropping into a long correction. In the past few years, companies like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) have surpassed BlackBerry, and its shares have fallen into single digits.

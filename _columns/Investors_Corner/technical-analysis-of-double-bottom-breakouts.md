Technical analysis still has its shares of naysayers, but decades of IBD research show that there's something to it. Actually, there's a lot to it. At its most basic level, technical analysis is the study of supply and demand in a stock. Understanding when institutional investors are accumulating a stock can result in big profits for individual investors. Similarly, understanding when they're selling can protect your portfolio from big losses.


Basic technical analysis skills helped many IBD readers sidestep the market carnage when tech stocks topped in 2000. It also helped them reap big profits at the start of the bull markets in March 2003 and March 2009.


An [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) series kicked off last week, introducing the concept of what it means when a stock "bases." After the initial [column](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/770462-bases-are-just-chart-patterns.htm), we discussed two patterns that have yielded successful breakouts for decades: the [cup with handle](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/770661-know-your-cup-with-handle-bases.htm) and [flat base](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/770928-flat-base-sign-big-investors-wont-sell.htm).


Today's focus is the double-bottom pattern. The pattern looks like the letter W. The correction on the left side depends on what the market is doing, but it generally should be 20%-30%. If the major stock indexes correct 15%-20% off their highs, a 30% pullback by a stock is common.


The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the middle peak.


Every good base should have a shakeout where the last remaining sellers exit the stock. In the cup-with-handle pattern, the handle is where the shakeout occurs. Shakeouts can also occur at the bottom of a base. In the double-bottom pattern, the shakeout occurs when the second leg down undercuts the first, but not excessively so.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) formed not one but two double-bottom patterns in 2009-10. The first was a nine-week base **(1)** with a buy point of 58.10. In the week ended Jan. 29, Netflix shot up straight off the bottom as shares surged 22% in huge volume. It never looked back and more than doubled over the next five months.


After that, Netflix formed another double-bottom base **(2)**. This one just met the minimum length of seven weeks and had a more symmetrical look. After the breakout past 124.10 in big volume, Netflix more than doubled again over the next 11 months.


Of course, not all double-bottom breakouts yield triple-digit gains. They tend to have the best chances of success in the early stages of a new market uptrend.

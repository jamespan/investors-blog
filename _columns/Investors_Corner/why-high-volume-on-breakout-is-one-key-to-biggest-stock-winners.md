Once you've identified a growth stock with good fundamentals, a correctly shaped base and a clear buy point, there's only one thing left to do: Watch for a breakout.

A breakout occurs when a stock clears its buy point in volume that's at least 40% above its daily average over the past 50 sessions. When that happens, the stock has turned a corner and has a good chance of racking up big gains — provided there's no significant change in the stock's fundamentals or the market's uptrend.

IBD research on [chart patterns](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786) shows that a stock's price often accelerates when it clears its buy point in a properly formed base.

But a breakout in weak volume is typically a bad sign; it indicates that institutional investors probably aren't participating. In such cases, the stock may keep basing, build a handle or go into a correction.

Watching the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/at-a-stocks-breakout-learn-to-spot-crucial-clues-in-rs-line/) can also help to confirm the breakout's strength. The RS line should be hitting new highs, or at least rising strongly. It shows the stock is outperforming the S&P 500, and thus the broad market.

A falling or flat RS line is a warning sign because it shows the stock is a laggard. One reason for that could be that the base is third or fourth stage and the stock's rally is losing steam. Such late-stage bases are risky because they usually form after the stock has already enjoyed a long run-up.

Breakouts accompanied by weak volume or a lagging RS line should prompt you to keep a finger on the "sell" button to prevent taking a loss on the stock. Or, to be safe, watch to see if volume kicks in a day or two after the breakout before jumping in.

Of course, the Market Pulse box, which accompanies IBD's daily [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), should indicate that the market's current outlook is in a confirmed uptrend. And the stock should show strong and preferably accelerating profit and sales growth.

**![ICdrys071416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ICdrys071416-236x300.jpg)DryShips** ([DRYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRYS)), whose vessels transport dry bulk goods, began forming a nicely shaped cup base in January 2007. The buy point was 10 cents above the left-side high of the base, or 18.47.

Trading was tight and the stock's RS line was rising sharply as it cleared the buy point on Feb. 20 on double its average daily volume. Every [IBD chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) features the RS line in blue. The stock's Composite Rating was also a respectable 88 on the day of the breakout.

DryShips more than tripled in less than three months, hitting a high of 42.20 on May 15.

Keep in mind that while it may be tempting to buy a good-looking stock before it reaches its buy point, it's important to avoid doing so. That's because many stocks stall and then retreat just before reaching their buy points.

Also, a stock that closes sharply below its buy point and fails to recover quickly is waving a red flag. Such breakouts often end up failing, especially when the market rally is under pressure or going into a correction.

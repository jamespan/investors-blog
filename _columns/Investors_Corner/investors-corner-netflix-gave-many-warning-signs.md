**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) plunged 5% in triple-pace trade on July 26 in what proved to be just the beginning of the end for one of the market's all-time winners. Who could have seen that coming?

  

You, that's who.

  

Forget the streaming-vs.-DVD issue, the company's warning that subscriber growth would slow, or what came to be the worst-received price hike since the oil embargo in the 1970s.

  

It was all in the chart.

  

Let's look at all the sell signals flashed by Netflix before it began its nose dive, focusing mainly on the weekly chart.

  

• **Late-stage base:** Netflix had already pushed out from at least five valid bases since emerging as a leader in the post-subprime-crisis market of 2009-11.

  

So you knew that the square-box base that appeared last May 25 was a late-stage structure — very late-stage. This alone could have kept you out of Netflix's last run.

  

• **Low-volume advances:** When Netflix broke out of that square box on May 25 **1**, volume surged in a healthy manner. But the ensuing action shows no special upside volume.

  

• **Downside reversal:** Heavy volume reappeared the week ended July 15 **2**, and that's as a downside reversal. Netflix scored a new high, then reversed lower and closed the week with a small loss. Volume rose 27% above its usual weekly pace.

  

• **Losing streak:** That downside reversal proved to be the first of a four-week losing streak **3**.

  

• **High-volume slice below the 10-week moving average:** Netflix dived below this crucial support line in the week ending July 29. This was Week 3 of the four-week losing streak.

  

Now let's shift to the daily chart. What do you notice? On July 26, it fell 5% in huge volume. The stock rebounded one session, then kept dropping further. ([Click here](/NewsAndAnalysis/PhotoPopup.aspx?path=WebCorner1018.gif&docId=588328) to see a daily chart.)

  

• **Climax run:** That stretch from June 21 to July 13 saw the stock run up nearly 25%. This is not the most dramatic climax run you'll ever find, but Netflix did show several telltale signs of topping action.

  

The brief incline was steep. An exhaustion gap appeared July 5. The stock surged 21.64 points, or 8%, that day, among the biggest point gains of the entire run.

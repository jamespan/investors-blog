IBD offers many potential stock ideas on its pages and online, from the market and feature columns to the charts and tables. For investors who also like to take an in-depth look at one promising stock at a time, the IBD Stock Analysis column is right up their alley (please read more details about this column in Monday's [Investor's Corner article](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/743369-find-great-stocks.htm)).

  

Many leading stocks that have gone on to make big price gains have been featured in the IBD Stock Analysis. Today we'll look at **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which is trading near all-time highs and is still a relatively new issue, at a little under 3 years old as a publicly traded company.

  

Despite being one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of all time, the social network didn't have an auspicious start. It became public May 18, 2012, amid much fanfare and spiked that day before closing near the low of the session range.

  

The stock then headed south, eventually forming a base, which it cleared in July 2013. It next broke out from a second-stage cup base in December that year. Facebook was featured in IBD Stock Analysis on Dec. 5, 2013 **(1)**, ahead of the breakout, which occurred in the week ended Dec. 20.

  

Investors who read the article and decided to buy shares after conducting their own additional due diligence could have logged a 32% gain in three months from a 54.93 buy point.

  

Facebook was next highlighted in the column on May 2, 2014 **(2)**, as the stock was shaping its third-stage base. It discussed the key news about the company since the December article, including its February buy of popular texting service WhatsApp for \$19 billion in cash and stock.

  

In March 2014, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said the social network would spend \$2 billion to buy virtual reality headset maker Oculus Rift. And just ahead of the May 2 article date, the company announced new products and features that would let developers better monetize their apps, which would help Facebook make more money as well.

  

While it saw no earnings growth in the first two quarters after its Nasdaq debut, it began posting gains in 2013, and in Q1 2014 topped earnings and sales views with 183% profit growth on a 72% revenue increase.

  

But not all its fundamentals were up to par. Facebook faced heavy selling in the weeks prior to the column date, bringing its Accumulation/Distribution Rating down to a worst-possible E. On the positive side, the number of funds owning shares was on the rise, indicating institutional demand over the longer term.

  

On the technical front, during the week the column appeared Facebook found support at its 40-week moving average, also near the buy point of the prior base.

  

"So this former area of resistance has now become an area of support," the column said. "That's a positive sign, and could mean Facebook is forming a new steppingstone as it prepares to climb higher."

  

At the time, the potential buy point was 72.69, a dime above the left peak. The stock ended up forming a handle with a 66.57 entry, which it cleared in late July.

  

Facebook has since climbed higher and is currently working on a new cup with handle.

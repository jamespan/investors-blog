While the 50-day moving average seems to get the most attention, investors should also use the longer-term 200-day line.

The 200-day moving average can help you with your trading. Like the 50-day line, the 200-day average can be used as a trend indicator, and it can act as a level of support or resistance. It can be used to give sell signals in some cases, too.

Simply put, the 200-day line adds up a stock's latest 200 closing prices and divides that number by 200.

The 200-day line can identify key support or resistance levels for individual stocks and major market averages such as the Nasdaq or the S&P 500.

Often, a rally off a low will halt at the 200-day moving average. On the flip side, a pullback will sometimes stop at the 200-day line.

So the 200-day moving average can give you an idea of how much potential a move has on the upside or the downside.

The 200-day moving average is often the dividing line between uptrend and downtrend. Generally speaking, you can consider a stock trading above the 200-day line to be in bullish territory.

When shares are below the line, the stock is in bear country. While a breach of the line in above-average trade can be a bad sign, it doesn't always have to be. Sometimes a stock will waver around the line before the next move up or down.

The 200-day line can also point you to sell signals. If you've been lucky enough to ride a big winner for months, consider selling if the 200-day moving average starts to roll over. It's a sign that the stock is losing momentum.

Investors should also sell when a stock breaks the 200-day line in heavy trading after a long uptrend. But this is a late sell signal.

**Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)), the maker of the colorful plastic shoes, was a huge winner from 2006 to 2007. The stock broke out from a cup base in early May and more than doubled.

However, the stock gapped below its 50-day line and plunged 36% Nov. 1 on disappointing quarterly sales and a weak outlook. Two days later, Crocs sliced its 200-day line for the first time ever in heavy trading, marking a late sell signal **(1)**.

Crocs dropped about 50% from its Oct. 31, 2007 all-time high a few sessions later.

Although it poked back above its 200-day line in early December **(2)**, the good times didn't last long. Crocs eventually plunged to below 1 a share in 2008.

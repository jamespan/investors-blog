A good engineer knows and follows the technical rules of the trade, but also leans upon intuition in problem solving. Finding buy points depends upon a similar mix of education and imagination.

  

**Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) initially offered a black-and-white buy point in March 2010.

  

The stock had formed an eight-week cup. It started to shape a handle, but moved fast after it reported a jump in sales during its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report on March 11. It broke out above the buy point, up 8% in huge trade, but then things got murky.

  

Investors looking for follow-on buy opportunities may have seen a square box form from mid-March to early April **1**. The base, part of a base-on-base pattern, was less than perfect. The price barely topped the left-side high in the second week of April. The weekly closes wedged higher across the base. Neither problem is a deal killer, but the stock was just not behaving properly.

  

Still, the stock shot above the 24.20 buy point in heavy trade April 22 **2**. But it soon pulled back in frantic trade. By May 6, it had fallen 14% below the buy point, negating the breakout **3**.

  

The stock then swung into two months of erratic trade. Shares sawed back and forth through the 10-week moving average line. The cuts were too deep to qualify as normal rebounds and the stock's behavior did little to encourage investors to move more cash onto Ulta's table.

  

The company reported a blowout fiscal first quarter on June 3. Still, shares fell 9% for the week to end below the 10-week line.

  

The stock continued lower the following week, ended June 11, but reversed by gaining 7% and ending at the absolute top of the week's trading range **4**. This was the turning point. The back-and-forth trade continued, but in a more settled fashion as the stock dipped into a two month correction.

  

Trading within that correction was tight and contained. The pattern became a crystal-clear double-bottom base with a 25.99 buy point. Shares broke above that mark in heavy trade on Sept. 3 **5**, just after Ulta announced its fiscal second-quarter results.

  

The stock has rallied 165% above that buy mark.

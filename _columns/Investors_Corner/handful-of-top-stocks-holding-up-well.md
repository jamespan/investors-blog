A handful of leading stocks are holding up well even though the market's uptrend has once again come under [pressure](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm).


**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), a designer of chips for surveillance and wearable sports cameras, led the way by jumping 1.39, or 4%, on Tuesday to an all-time high of 40.98.


The stock is extended after a recent breakout over a 33.91 buy point. Ambarella has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, putting it at the top of the highly rated Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.


**Salix Pharmaceuticals** ([SLXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLXP)) hit a new high on a news report that **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) is in advanced talks to acquire the drugmaker. Salix rose 9.34, or 6%, to 169.17 in huge volume. It's extended from a 141.91 buy point and from a rebound off its 10-week line.


Meanwhile, social media giant **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) touched an all-time high after reversing higher. It ended up 1.49 at 78.29 and is still in buying range after retaking a 76.09 entry.


Biotech **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) is also trading near its recent high. It edged down 8 cents Tuesday to 105.39, but it's extended after a rebound off its 10-week moving average. On Friday, the European Commission approved Gilead's drug Zydelig to treat two types of blood cancer.


**Synchronoss Technologies** ([SNCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNCR)) fell 62 cents to 43.40. The provider of software for the financial industry has formed a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 45.69 buy point.

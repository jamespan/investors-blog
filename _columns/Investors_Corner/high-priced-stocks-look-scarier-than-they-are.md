For some individual investors, big numbers trigger something akin to fear of heights.


 


Looking at a stock that’s trading at a triple-digit price might seem like the view from a skyscraper's rooftop or glass floor.


Yet just like acrophobia, the panic surrounding high-priced stocks is an irrational impulse.


Such investors often feel safer buying low-priced stocks, which ironically have far more built-in problems.


Step back and think about the triple-digit stock from two angles. First, an investor always has the 8% sell rule as protection. Second, no professional money manager shares this fear of triple-digit stocks. If a fund manager is spooked by price alone, he or she is in the wrong business.


Big numbers alone have nothing to do with risk. Generally, little numbers actually carry more risk: They are often thinly traded stocks and lack institutional support. Thinly traded stocks are also more vulnerable to attacks from short sellers.


So, if the best minds on Wall Street don’t want any part of a \$2 stock, why should you? Likewise, if the best minds on Wall Street are selectively loading up on stocks trading in triple digits, why should you be afraid?


The stock market operates in ways that are often counterintuitive. What seems like “common sense” to the novice investor is nonsense to the pro. The successful investor needs to get over fears that are not grounded in reality.


This, by the way, is a major difference between an experienced investor or an accomplished professional and a novice. The situation that makes a veteran confident will scare a novice, while the situation that scares a veteran will enthuse a novice. Experience rewires emotions.


The point here isn’t that an individual investor should buy a stock simply because the price is high. All we’re saying is this: Don’t rule out a stock because of price alone.


On Sept. 1, 2010, the Nasdaq delivered a Day 4 follow-through, confirming that a [market uptrend](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) was underway. A number of quality stocks were trading in triple digits, and some broke out in the new uptrend.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) jumped about 6% on the follow-through day. The stock cleared a 154.53 buy point in volume 124% above average. The burrito and taco chain had grown earnings per share 67% in 2009 on a 14% sales gain to \$1.52 billion. The stock rose 70% in three months. It peaked on Aug. 5, 2015, at 758.


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) traded briefly within the 5% buy zone from a 124.10 double-bottom breakout price on the follow-through day. The buy zone was up to 130.31. From there, the stock advanced 60% in three months.


**Priceline Group** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) also traded in the 5% buy zone on the follow-through day. The buy zone ran to roughly 295. The stock climbed about 90% in eight months.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) broke out Sept. 9, 2010, clearing a double-bottom buy point at 266.09 -- initially in low trade, but volume picked up in the second half of the month. The stock delivered a 37% gain in five months.

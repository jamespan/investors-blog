The success of a stock does not depend on its place in the alphabet. That's why IBD's stock tables aren't arranged from A to Z.

  

Instead, Investor's Business Daily has taken a unique approach to listing daily stock quotes in its pages.

  

The IBD SMART NYSE + Nasdaq Tables (today starting on Page B3) initially are arranged by broad industry sectors, from the best performing to the weakest over the past three months. Why? Industry performance weighs a lot on a stock's performance.

  

Within each sector is an alphabetical listing of the stocks that constitute it, with closing price and daily change. But that's just the beginning. For each stock, the IBD Ratings are shown, plus volume, volume percentage change and a few other facts. With this data, the Smart Tables take on the role of research tool. Focus on the ones with highest ratings (particularly the Composite Rating), then research them further.

  

Companies that went public within the past 15 years and have EPS and RS Ratings of at least 80 are noted with a black triangle next to the company name. In broad terms, winning stocks tend to be fairly new and leaders in price and earnings performance.

  

A few stocks that boast especially strong fundamentals get special treatment. Those Sector Leaders are displayed atop their sector, with details on their latest earnings, profit estimates, date of the next earnings announcement, sales growth, pretax margin and return on equity.

  

Investors should focus primarily on the Sector Leaders, today on Page B3. Their performance has been nothing short of outstanding. As of Wednesday's IBD, Sector Leaders are up 78.6% â€” triple the S&P 500's 25.6% gain.

  

Each Sector Leader weekly mini-chart provides a line of brief chart analysis at the bottom so you know if the stock is currently trading near a proper buy point. Never buy stocks that are extended.

  

What if you don't know in which sector to find a particular company? There are a couple of ways. Call up a quote of the stock on the [home page](https://www.investors.com) of Investors.com. The sector is displayed at the top of the quote page.

  

Another way is to visit <https://www.investors.com/pdf/sectors/SectorbyCoName-20131119.pdf> . That will take readers to a file they can download with all companies and the sector they belong to.

  

One last note: Stocks under \$10 a share are omitted because they tend to be illiquid and thus not of institutional quality.

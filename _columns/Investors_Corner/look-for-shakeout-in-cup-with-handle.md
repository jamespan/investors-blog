Breakouts from cup-with-handle bases have a good track record of success, particularly in the early stages of a new market uptrend.

  

But the devil is in the details when it comes to which ones have the best chance of succeeding and producing big gains.

  

The soundest patterns with the least amount of flaws generally work the best. Over the next week, this column will analyze the flaws of past cup bases that ultimately failed. The goal: Help readers grasp such faults and steer away from stocks showing similar price-and-volume action.

  

It's always good to see a shakeout somewhere in a cup-with-handle pattern. After all, the fewer sellers present in a stock, the easier it is for the stock to break out with conviction.

  

A good shakeout can occur at the bottom of the base when a stock falls sharply, then rallies back to finish near its high in heavy volume.

  

A healthy shakeout also occurs when a stock forms a downward-slanting handle. The handle in the cup with handle is a vital part of the structure. A sound handle shows an orderly pullback in light volume, just enough to shake out sellers one last time. This price action paves the way for a heavy-volume breakout.

  

Sometimes, though, an adequate shakeout doesn't occur when the handle forms. After a brief pullback, a handle can wedge higher along its lows. This indicates a lack of buying demand, which is exactly what you don't want to see in a handle area. Avoid bases that carry an upward-wedging handle; this is a flaw.

  

**Ask Jeeves** formed a handle that wedged higher just before it tried to break out from a base in October 2004. After rallying off its low and hitting a high of 34.25 during the week ended Sept. 24, it looked like the stock was ready to add a handle when shares fell as much as 5% the following week **1**. But Jeeves ended with a gain of 1.4%. No shakeout yet.

  

Two weeks later, another shakeout tried to take shape when the stock fell 4% during the week, but Jeeves closed near its high, up 4% **2**. Still no shakeout.

  

In the week ended Oct. 22, the stock tried to break out with conviction. Shares rose 15% in heavy volume, then reversed and ended with a loss of 3%. Jeeves lost 38% in four months. **IAC/Interactive** ([IACI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IACI)) bought the firm in 2005.

  

The base had two more flaws. The left side of the cup corrected 49% â€” beyond the normal range of 12% to 33%. The handle formed in the base's lower half.

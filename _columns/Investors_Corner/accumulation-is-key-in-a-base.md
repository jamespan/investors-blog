With investing, as with many other things in life, often it's the details that matter.

In stocks, there are in fact many details that investors need to look for when studying bases that may usher a great breakout. Accumulation is one of the most important details. At times, it can be the difference between a good base and a great one.

Accumulation points to buying by professional and institutional investors such as hedge funds, mutual funds and pensions. They are the big players in the market. It's their buying and selling that have the power to push stock prices dramatically higher or lower.

Investors can check for accumulation in a number of ways. The first is to examine the volume action on a stock's chart. Seeing big advances on a chart is a good thing, but the move will mean a lot more when it's accompanied by hefty turnover. The amount of volume behind a move often tells you about the level of conviction.

When you're analyzing chart patterns, focus on the weekly time frame. Check on the action on a week-by-week basis.

It's nice to see up weeks in heavy volume (you'll see them as tall blue bars on a chart at Investors.com). Those are the footprints of professional investors. Tally the up weeks in heavy volume and compare against the number of down weeks in heavy volume (red bars). Ideally, you want to see more of the former in a base. This can give you a quick idea of who's in control.

Bases with many big blue weeks tell you that professionals are piling into the stock. On the flip side, a large number of red weeks tell you that the big guns are selling the stock.

But a down week in heavy volume isn't always bad. If a stock falls on the week but closes in the upper 60% of the week's trading range, the action is considered accumulation. Buyers came in to support the stock.

You can quickly tell where a stock closed in relation to its trading range if you use [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com); just right click on the price bar. Otherwise, subtract the low of the day from the closing. Then divide by the trading range.

Investors can also check on accumulation with IBD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which measures heavy-volume buying and selling over the latest 13 weeks. Pick stocks with A or B ratings. A C rating is neutral, reflecting an equal amount of buying and selling by the institutions. A D or E means that fund managers are likely net sellers.

Another tool that investors can use is the up-down volume ratio, which you can find at [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) or [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx). You want to see a figure of 1.0 or better.

From March to May of last year, **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) shaped a flat base with a 65.93 buy point. The structure had three up weeks in above-average turnover **(1)**, compared to two down weeks in heavy trading. That's positive.

The **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) supplier and chip designer broke out in the week ended May 9 in huge turnover. Avago was added to the S&P 500 on May 7. Avago had an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- just before breaking out. The stock climbed 16% by late July before making its first pullback to its 10-week moving average **(2)**. By September, it rose 38% past the proper entry.

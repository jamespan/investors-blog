If a golfer has bad mechanics, practice won't help. All practice will do is turn the flaw into a deeply ingrained habit that is harder to correct. Investing is much the same. If your understanding of investing and your approach are wrong, improvement will be difficult until you correct the misconceptions and build sound approaches.

  

An [IBD workshop](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=A011BMT) can help an investor get and stay on the right track.

  

Some folks object to the idea of taking instruction from anyone below the hall of fame level. "If the instructor knows so much, why isn't he or she a billionaire?"

  

This is sort of like insisting that your local golf pro have the abilities of Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth or Jason Day before you accept any teachings. It's fallacious thinking because performance is one thing, coaching another.

  

Jack Grout was the golfing coach that Jack Nicklaus called when his game faltered. Nicklaus turned to Grout for the teacher's ability to spot flaws and identify solutions.

  

IBD's workshop instructors know the O'Neil [investing approach](http://education.investors.com/) , and they can spot flaws in your investing game. (Several are top-notch portfolio managers with coaching ability, which is a rare combination.)

  

What can an investor expect to get out of an IBD workshop?

  

You shouldn't expect to become a world class investor, but noticeable improvement is a realistic goal.

  

The Level 1 workshop on Beginning Strategies will set a solid foundation. Sometimes novices show up at the Level 1 workshop expecting a get-rich-quick scheme. Novices should focus on slowly learning the material. You want the lessons to stick. Incomplete understanding, combined with enthusiasm, is dangerous.

  

The Level 2 workshop on Intermediate Strategies offers the investor more in-depth market-tracking techniques.

  

Level 3 Chart School, a two-day event, is more intensive. Advanced chart reading, portfolio management and holding and selling techniques are the focus.

  

The Level 4 Masters Program, held each year since 2004 in December in Santa Monica, Calif., also is a two-day event. This advanced seminar is not for beginners. See the entire schedule of events on Investors.com by hovering the mouse over "IBD University" on the home page, then clicking on "Live Investing Workshops" under "Quick Links."

  

New students of the CAN SLIM method should avoid taking too much risk as they learn the approach. Mistakes will be made and cost money — think of it as tuition — but you want to keep the penalties small. If you start by investing 10% of your money pile in CAN SLIM stocks, you should only increase the pile if you are successful.

  

The last thing you want to do is jump in before you truly understand the rules, and then incur nasty losses. Take it slow and learn as you go.

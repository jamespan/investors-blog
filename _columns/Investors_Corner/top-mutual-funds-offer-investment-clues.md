Leery about picking stocks on your own?

  

Novice traders with little knowledge or confidence to pick winning stocks may benefit by first seeing what great mutual funds are buying.

  

Funds rule the market. After all, they spend millions, even billions, of dollars buying individual stocks. They're armed with large research staffs whose sole job is to come up with the best stocks among the thousands offered.

  

All investors would do well to follow what the big mutual funds are buying and selling with conviction.

  

**Demand The Best**

  

It's not enough to follow just any mutual fund. IBD ranks mutual fund performance over the past 36 months with letter grades of A+ to E. IBD recommends that you focus on funds with A+, A or A- ratings.

  

Top funds outperform the S&P 500 while offering protection in a declining market, as their managers actively try to reduce risk by adjusting the fund's holdings.

  

Fidelity Magellan Fund has been a long-time leader. It's rated A and has climbed 13% this year, outpacing the S&P 500's 10% gain.

  

The fund holds 165 stocks. Big holdings include **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)),**Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) and **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)).

  

Of those, Apple and Google have an IBD Composite Rating of 80 or higher. The chart accompanying this column shows the highest-rated stocks that Magellan has among its top 30 holdings.

  

Don't blindly buy what the funds are buying. The best stocks that get accumulated by the strongest-performing funds will form good bases and set up buy points within those bases. That's the correct time to buy such stocks. (Go to IBD University at Investors.com to learn about the seven basic base patterns and how to buy correctly.)

  

Investors should make sure their objectives fit the goals of the fund.

  

For example, the Fidelity Magellan Fund invests in large-cap growth stocks, while the TIAA-CREF Enhanced Large Cap Growth Fund , also rated A, primarily invests in large domestic companies.

  

The 297-stock TIAA fund, whose top holdings are Apple, Google, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), has risen 9% this year, slightly underperforming the Magellan fund and the S&P 500. However, that could be due to TIAA's emphasis on relatively more conservative large-cap stocks. During the market's sharp fall in 2008-09, the TIAA fund fell less than both the Magellan Fund and the S&P 500.

  

Meanwhile, lower-rated funds tend to underperform during bull markets and bear markets. For example, Wells Fargo Advantage Growth Fund , rated C+, is up just 3% this year. It focuses on large-cap growth stocks. The fund's top holdings include **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), **Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)), **CarMax** ([KMX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMX)) and Google.

  

Invesco Midcap Growth Fund is also underperforming the S&P 500 this year, up just 6%. Its biggest holdings include **Amphenol** ([APH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APH)), **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)), **NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals.

  

Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. IBD's ratings cover just three years of performance. Investors should also check a fund's long-term performance while conducting stock research.

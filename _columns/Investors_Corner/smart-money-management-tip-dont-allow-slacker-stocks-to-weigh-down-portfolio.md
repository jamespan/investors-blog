As an uptrend picks up speed, it's reasonable for an investor to reposition his or her portfolio. Unfortunately, human nature will often work against the investor. How so?


 


The undisciplined investor will often cash in his or her biggest gainer (fearing it will reverse) and hold onto the laggard (hoping it will catch fire).


This is the opposite of what the investor should be doing. In a strong market, letting your winners run makes sense. The laggards should be your sell candidates.


Let's imagine you have four stocks in your portfolio. The market's in a strong uptrend. In a strong market, 3 of every 4 stocks will rise. And that's what's happening in your portfolio.


Your best stock has risen 33% in the past five weeks following a breakout. Two other stocks are up 10% and 12%. A fourth stock is a laggard that has been sitting in your portfolio for six months doing nothing. Thanks to recent modest gains, the stock is now only 3% below your buy point.


Which stock should be sold?


Let Winners Roam
----------------


The undisciplined investor will sell the big winner because he's afraid of losing the gain. He'll show patience with the laggard, though. He might even take the money raised from selling the winner and double down on the laggard because "that will lower my break-even point, and my gut instinct says this stock's due to come around."


The disciplined investor will do the opposite. She will sell the loser and use the cash to buy more shares of the winner when the stock offers a new entry. The entry could come through a three-weeks-tight pattern, a bounce off the 50-day moving average in strong volume, or a new flat base that delivers a breakout in strong volume.


If you've tried this strategy in the past with bad results, it's probably because you misjudged the market. The key that lets the strategy work is the strong market uptrend. In a weak or choppy uptrend, the disciplined investor's bias would be to sell anything that hints at weakness. And if the market shifts into a correction, any cash raised would remain on the sidelines.


Stocks Are Like Employees
-------------------------


For many people, selling the laggards and holding the winners is a hard concept to accept. It shouldn't be hard, though, if you think about it the right way.


Imagine you have a business. You hire four people. One employee is a standout. Two others are steady producers. A fourth is a slacker who has trouble getting motivated to do anything.


It wouldn't take long to figure out whom to fire, would it?


One thing you wouldn't do is say this: "We really need to get rid of that standout employee because I'm afraid she can't continue to outperform, and besides, her salary is higher than the others. Let's fire her and give a raise to the slacker. It might motivate him, and just think what a star performer he'll be when he gets off his duff. He might look like a bad hire now, but I don't make mistakes in hiring, so I'm sure he'll come around."


Does that sound nuts? Yet many investors take that approach to the stocks in their portfolio.


The stocks in your portfolio are supposed to be working for you, not sitting around waiting for inspiration. Don't let the slacker stocks hang around taking up space. Free them "to pursue other interests" and run with the winners until their charts tell you the run is over.

Current earnings are important to investors looking for a winning stock. Those familiar with IBD’s [CAN SLIM investing approach](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735730) know that the C stands for 25% earnings-per-share growth for at least the past two quarters.


History’s greatest stocks had at least that much at the start of their great runs.


“Our study of all the stock market superstars from the last century and a quarter found that they did indeed share common characteristics,” William J. O’Neil wrote in “How to Make Money in Stocks.”


O’Neil continued, “None of these characteristics, however, stood out as boldly as the profits each big winner reported in the latest quarter or two before its major price advance.”


This was true regardless of the era.


For example, in 1914, Studebaker’s quarterly earnings jumped 296% before the stock advanced from 45 to 190 in eight months.


In recent decades, individual investors have seen similar action in the stock of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), Dell, Google (now **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) and others.


Of the 600 best-performing stocks, “three out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the latest reported quarter before they began their major advances,” O’Neil wrote.


![ICcht-030416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ICcht-030416-1024x526.jpg)One thing to watch out for is earnings deceleration. If a stock grew earnings 25% in the most recent quarter, but in the previous quarter EPS growth was 75% or more, that can spell trouble.


“Even the best organizations can have a slow quarter every once in a while. So before turning negative on a company’s earnings, I prefer to see two consecutive quarters of material slowdown. This usually means a decline of two-thirds or greater from the previous rate -- a slowdown from 100% earnings growth to 30%, for example, or from 50% to 15%,” O’Neil wrote.


Another factor to consider is seasonality. For instance, some companies get most of their revenue in the Christmas season.


**Michaels Cos.** ([MIK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MIK)) is highly seasonal. The fourth quarter, which includes the Christmas season, accounts for about 46% of annual operating income, according to Michaels’ 10-K report.


A sequential revenue or earnings decline from Q4 to Q1 often doesn’t mean much for such companies.


Michaels went public in June 2014 and rallied 76% from its IPO price of 17. The stock peaked at 30 in March 2015 and has been forming a long base ever since. Michaels' 95 EPS Rating out of a maximum 99 underscores the solid annual EPS increases from 2011 to 2015 as well as double-digit profit gains in five of the past six quarters.


There’s another angle on quarterly earnings.


The number of stocks that meet the 25% earnings growth threshold says something about the stock market’s health.


At the start of this year, 20 stocks qualified -- the least vs. the previous three years.


A great number of choices doesn’t necessarily mean all that much if the stocks are late stage. Those stocks are likely to fail regardless of the fundamentals.


However, success is more likely when there are many strong stocks to choose from.

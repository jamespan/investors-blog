IBD's stock screens already find top-performing stocks, and now investors can refine those lists even more or even customize them thanks to a relatively new product.

[IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/#) offers the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Stock Spotlight](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [New Highs](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/new-high-list-oct-10-2019/) and other screens that discover market winners, often before they start their major runs. If that weren't useful enough, Stock Screener makes it possible to filter those lists with your own criteria.

For example, you can customize each list to show stocks with a specific [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) or a range of this key proprietary gauge of fundamentals, stock price strength and quality of institutional ownership. You can set minimum and maximum levels for price ranges, sales and earnings growth rates. In essence, investors can turbocharge these lists.

During weak markets, some stocks of lower quality can start appearing on our screens. So this tool can help you keep screens at a high quality.

Find the IBD Stock Screener by going to the homepage of Investors.com, then hover your pointer on "Research" in the main navigation bar.

Stock Screener is not limited to IBD lists. Its filtering tools also can be applied to [My Stock Lists](https://myibd.investors.com/my-ibd/portfolio.aspx), the user-made lists for subscribers at Investors.com.

Moreover, IBD Stock Screener gives users many more tools than currently available on My Stock Lists. That's because Stock Screener shows all [IBD ratings](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) without having to click on [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). Users can create multiple ways of filtering their lists.

## How To Invest: Charts, Checklists, Articles

Some other features of this new product:

- The right column displays the stock's chart with a brief analysis written by IBD market writers. Weekly, daily and intraday charts are available.
- Key IBD ratings and price and volume data are displayed on the right column, too. Click on "More," and you'll access a checklist with pass, fail or neutral grades. Green is for passing, red for fail and orange for neutral. That goes for a raft of data points, including profit estimates, earnings surprise percentage and quarters of accelerating growth.
- The most recent IBD articles on the company are in the right column. Keep in mind that some stories make only brief mentions of the company.
- You can download all lists onto Excel spreadsheets. Look for the "Export" link near the top of the product page.
- A series of three dots at the left of each stock gives access to stock quotes and [MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=ms-3weeks) or [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) charts, if you get those services.
- You can set a dark background mode, which many users finds easier to view, or go with the default white background. Select your preference with a switch at the top of the page with a shining sun and a crescent moon.

Subscribers can create up to five My Stock Lists, each with a maximum number of 50 companies. So, it's possible to create a list from, say, your brokerage and run it through the IBD Stock Screener.

There is no extra cost for this product, but a digital subscription to Investors.com is required.

In October 2021, IBD launched a column that examines the various lists in IBD Stock Screener. The [Screen of the Day column](https://www.investors.com/research/growth-stocks-earnings-estimates-rising-these-companies/) highlights a screen with a good number of actionable stocks and provides some analysis on the best ones.

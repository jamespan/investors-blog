Searching for strong stock candidates can be a full-time job, given the thousands of possibilities to choose from in the U.S. market alone. Add to that the parameter of finding those shares that are near buy points or staging breakouts, and you have a daunting task on your hands.

  

But don't fret. IBD can help.

  

Many IBD features — in both the print and online versions — are designed to help investors find leading stocks that are shaping sound bases or nearing buy points.

  

In this column, we'll focus on how readers can use Sector Leaders and Stock Spotlight to help spot top stocks that are breaking out to new highs.

  

[Sector Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/sector-leaders-review.htm) (today on page B1) highlights up to 16 of the top-performing stocks from IBD's 33 sectors. These stocks are considered the creme de la creme: They meet stringent criteria including superior earnings, sales growth, return on equity and price performance.

  

The accompanying column features one or more of the stocks that make the screen. If a stock is within striking distance of a buy point or still in the 5% buy zone, it gets a black border, making it easy for readers to find.

  

Even if a stock isn't boxed, the chart analysis at the bottom of each is updated ever day. So you can quickly view the weekly chart and stay on top of where a stock is in relation to its buy point.

  

Now you might wonder: Why does IBD home in on sectors, both in the Sector Leaders and in the tables, where stocks are grouped by their sectors?

  

IBD studies have shown that industry group performance accounts for 37% of a stock's price movement, while the overall sector makes up another 12%. So about half a stock's move is tied to group and sector strength.

  

"Because specific industry groups lead each market cycle, you can see how worthwhile it is to consider a stock's industry before making a purchase," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

[Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-spotlight/100915-774949-airlines-still-acting-bullish.htm) column in IBD's Oct. 12 issue featured Hawaiian and other airline stocks.

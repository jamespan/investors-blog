In the world of stock market chart reading, tight is good. By tight, we mean that a stock closes near the prior close, especially on a weekly chart, and that the daily or weekly ranges show little fluctuation in price.




Put another way, the stock seems boring. It appears to do little except bide its time.


In reality, it reveals that [institutional investors](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735744&sourceid=735749) are showing no urgency to sell, even if the stock has gone on a big run. On the contrary, they won't let the stock go down, nibbling at any small show of weakness, adding to their positions in anticipation of a continued rise. That activity holds the stock in place.


When analyzing a base, the savvy chart reader will look for weekly closes that are tight, especially near the bottom of [the base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). They reveal that big investors consider the stock a bargain and are nibbling away, preventing the stock from falling.

But what about a stock that has already broken out and is extended from a [primary buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/)?


That's good news, too, because those big investors still see price upside in the stock and are preventing it from falling. Once again, the big boys are nibbling away at any show of weakness.


Institutional investors are the key to understanding the market. They make up the [I in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/institutional-sponsorship/).


This class of stock buyers can't buy a full position all at once, so they must accumulate shares over a period of weeks or months — shares that they hope to hold for several years.


They keep their moves secret because they don't want other investors to buy ahead of them, raising the price. But even if we don't know who's doing the buying, we can see the effect on the chart and gauge that the stock is under accumulation.


How To Use Stock Charts: URBN Stock Post-Analysis
-------------------------------------------------


Take the example of **Urban Outfitters** ([URBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URBN)) during the bull market that started in March 2003. After a breakout in April 2003, the fashion and interior goods retailer gained 908% by December 2005.

The stock made a number of three-weeks-tight patterns. The pattern is defined as three straight weekly closes in which each is not more than 1% to 1.5% higher or lower than the previous week's close. Sometimes, a [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) becomes a four-weeks-tight.


A [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from a three-weeks-tight pattern is considered a secondary buy point. It's usually not stable or safe enough to be the launching pad for a full position, especially if it develops well above a [proper base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) and its [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). You can add 5% or 10% to an existing position, giving you extra punch if the stock keeps moving higher.


Urban Outfitters stock broke out of a deep base in the spring of 2003. It rose almost uninterrupted in January-February 2004, with four tight closes in a row **(1)**. Weekly closes were -0.4%, 0.9% and 1%.


The secondary buy point would have been 10 cents above the intraday high of the highest point during the pattern. The buy point would have been 21.15 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in July). The stock broke above that, stumbled a bit, then continued to a new high.


Higher still, the stock built a flat base and broke out from that. The savvy chart reader would have noticed two tight areas **(2)** within the six-week base, a sign that the flat base was sound and the stock was still under accumulation.

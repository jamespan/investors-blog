  Cool It: LPL Research Shows Why Stock Gains Often Follow Yield Curve Inversion

The sky isn't falling, despite the headlines surrounding the yield curve and the stock market's almost 24% slide in late 2018. Ditto the harsh sell-off on Aug. 14 this year on fears related to an [yield curve inversion](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve/).




Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Research, is a dissenter on the [yield curve issue](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/inverted-yield-curve/), thanks to research that LPL has done.


Back in December Detrick said, "Contrary to what many people think, inverted yield curves don't always sound the alarm to sell. In fact, looking at the past five recessions, the S&P 500 didn't peak for more than 19 months, on average, after the yield curve inverted."


In August, Detrick revisited the theme, noting that "historically, the S&P 500 Index has rallied an average of 22% from the first inversion to the eventual economic peak."


Last Happened In 2005
---------------------


An investor wouldn't know that from reading the headlines found online.


"The Yield Curve Just Inverted. That's Huge," said one headline in late 2018.


The 2018 inversion in the fourth quarter last year involved the three-year and five-year yields. According to Bloomberg News, the last time the three and the five inverted was August 2005. The market had its ups and downs in late 2005, but the Nasdaq had a 15% rally from mid-October to early January.


"Inversions at the short end of the yield curve, like we're seeing now, have had very little consistent predictive power for future recessions," according to LPL's December note.


On Aug. 14, Detrick added, "Given the continued strong employment picture and healthy U.S. consumer, there could still be time for this economic cycle to have plenty of life left."


The stock market usually shows alert investors [the symptoms of a major top in prices](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) before a recession hits the economy.


IBD's technique for spotting a [negative change in the general market direction](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/market-direction/) involves carefully analyzing the action of the major indexes and leading stocks each day. When [serious distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) (significant market declines in heavier volume) pile up and key growth stocks plunge, expect a major downgrade in the [IBD current outlook](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx).


Recession Signal, But How Soon?
-------------------------------


The longer end has the best record for accurate predictions.


"In fact, according to data from the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, the one-year and 10-year Treasury yield spread inverted prior to all nine recessions going back 60 years," LPL adds.


On Aug. 1, 2019, the 10-year yield was 1.87% vs. 1.88% for the one-year yield. The inversion deepened from there. As of Aug. 13, the 10-year yielded 1.6% vs. 1.81% for the one year.


This would suggest a recession is coming, but again, how soon isn't clear.

Stocks Up After Yield Curve Inversion
-------------------------------------


Another headline said, "Brace for a 15% plunge in S&P 500 next year if the Treasury yield curve fully inverts."


LPL and FactSet research shows something quite different for stocks in the wake of inversions in the two- and 10-year yields. The worst two S&P 500 performances from inversion to peak were 2.2% and 11.9%. The best was a 39.6% gain.


The curve looks a lot better today.


Headed into Wednesday's announcement of a fresh rate cut, the third in the fed funds rate this year, 3-month T-bills showed a yield of 1.63%. That's a touch lower than 1.64% for two-year notes and 1.84% for the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond.



One way to track yields? Look at the iShares 20+ Treasury ([TLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLT)) ETF.


The exchange traded fund goes up in price when investors bid up prices in government bonds and yields simultaneously fall. When bond prices fall, yields go up. TLT has been falling for more than three weeks; but at 138.90, TLT still holds a 14% gain year to date.


Trade War
---------


The stock market, though, continues to show some nervousness. The market at times has struggled with news-driven doubts — Britain's Brexit fight and the U.S.-China trade war are probably the chief worries.


Another factor to watch is the price of oil. A strong spike in oil prices has often occurred before a recession but not every recession.

Often it can seem like there's a big gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in investing.

  

That's not the case with IBD.

  

IBD's [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/) system of investing is pinned on practical, unbiased research into the traits of the best stocks in history.

  

What works in the past will work in the future, because the market has shown for over a century that the biggest winners show a long-term record of outstanding profit and sales growth. These winners get there by selling a product or service that is No. 1 in the industry and in heavy demand.

  

When you use IBD to find current winners, you simplify the research process. Plus, your search is based on what has really worked in the stock market.

  

Today, let's focus on blockbuster earnings trends, the 'C' (current earnings) and 'A' (annual earnings) in CAN SLIM. The key: Insist on both strong quarterly and yearly earnings growth.

  

In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William O'Neil wrote: "A standout stock needs both a sound growth record in recent years and a strong current earnings record in the last several quarters. It's the powerful combination of these two critical factors, rather than one or the other, that creates a super stock."

  

The fastest way to get a sense of a company's earnings performance is IBD's proprietary Earnings Per Share Rating.

  

The EPS Rating calculation combines a company's most recent two quarters of earnings growth with its three-year to five-year annual growth rate. The result is then compared to all other stocks and rated 1 to 99, with 99 being the very best.

  

The rating is available throughout the paper in stock tables and mini charts as well as online with a Stock Checkup or stock quote.

  

**Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), seen in the table above, earns a 98 EPS Rating. Digging deeper, we see that RH's earnings grew 53% last quarter and averaged more than 96% over the past three quarters. Its three-year annual growth rate is 62%.

  

With these growth numbers, it's no surprise to see an EPS Rating near the highest possible. After looking at many examples of EPS Ratings along with quarterly and annual growth rates, you get a sense for how powerful a company's earnings story is from one simple number.

  

Another timesaver: the SMR Rating. It stands for sales, profit margins and return on equity, and combines these key factors into a letter grade. The best investment candidates will have an A or B rating.

  

Restoration Hardware sports an A for SMR. Looking into the components, RH has a pretax profit margin of 16%, a return on equity of 13% and sales growth of 22% in the most recent quarter.

  

To see all of the fundamental data above and more, simply run a [Stock Checkup](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/735332-using-stock-checkup-for-can-slim.htm) on Investors.com.

  

IBD weaves key ratings and data into its stories. For example, check out the boldfaced names in Stocks on the Move for companies moving higher in heavy volume that have at least an 80 EPS Rating.

  

Lists in IBD, such as the IBD 50, Sector Leaders and Stock Spotlight, profile the market's top growth stocks in mini charts that are packed with key earnings data.

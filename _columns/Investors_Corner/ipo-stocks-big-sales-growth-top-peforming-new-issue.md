[Leading IPO stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) have dominated the headlines in recent weeks, with many scoring big gains. The common bond among them? An innovative new product or service that's fueling big sales growth — but also a lot of red ink.




A cardinal rule of IBD's investing methodology is to invest in growth stocks with a proven track record of profitability. It makes sense because earnings growth is the main driver of a stock's price. A consistent record of annual earnings growth alongside strong quarterly earnings growth is a key ingredient of successful stocks.


But profitable IPOs have been hard to come by lately. It's not surprising because many are still in spending mode to increase brand awareness and market share.


Profitable IPO Stocks
---------------------



A couple of exceptions are **Tradeweb Markets** ([TW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TW)) and **Palomar** ([PLMR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLMR)).


Tradeweb operates electronic marketplaces for the derivatives market. It flashed a sell signal after clearing a 44.35 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). That brought an alternate [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 46.33 into play. In recent days, Tradeweb rallied above this new buy point.


Palomar is a thinly traded small cap that continues to show relative strength. The insurer is holding gains nicely after a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) over a 20.72 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [initial IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/).



**Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)), another big short-term winner, has been moving back and forth between profitability and net losses amid booming sales growth. Sales in 2019 totaled \$331 million, up 119% from 2018.


IPO Stocks: Big Sales, But...
-----------------------------


But what about other top-performing IPO stocks like **Silk Road Medical** ([SILK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SILK)), **Shockwave Medical** ([SWAV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWAV)), **Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) and **PagerDuty** ([PD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PD))? All show solid sales growth in recent quarters, but none of them are profitable.


Does that mean they shouldn't be touched with a 10-foot pole? Hardly.

Investors who bought Silk Road Medical when it cleared an [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) with a 39.61 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) have been rewarded. Silk Road is a medical device company focused on reducing the risk of stroke with new products to treat carotid artery disease.


And Shockwave Medical have made a strong short-term run after a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) over a 43.39 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). But in recent days, the stock has undercut the newly formed 50-day moving average in heavy turnover, [a key moment to sell and take profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).


The medical device company is developing innovative treatments for calcified cardiovascular disease.


Lately, Silk Road has acted in parallel fashion with Shockwave Medical.


Meanwhile, burgeoning demand for Beyond Meat's plant-based meat products has Wall Street in a frenzy. The stock has been a stronger performer since its debut in early May at 24. Beyond Meat opened at 46 and closed at 65.75 on its first day of trading.


On June 18, shares hit a new all-time high of 201.88.


Beyond Meat is now [forming a new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).



PagerDuty continues to trade sharply above an initial pricing at \$24 a share, although its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) has begun to decline. The cloud-based software firm monitors and alerts businesses of IT issues.


IPO Stocks: Risk Vs. Reward
---------------------------


The stock market has shown in recent weeks that unprofitable IPOs can result in profitable trades. Buying IPO stocks that aren't profitable yet isn't for the faint of heart, but aggressive growth investors might choose to nibble at compelling setups when they arise.


While it's generally a good idea to target stocks with a consistent track record of earnings growth, exceptions can be made in the IPO market, especially if bullish technical setups are there for the taking.

If sales and earnings are a company's bread and butter, then cash flow, profit margins and return on equity are the spices.




Those three measurements of financial performance provide a deeper and important layer of stock analysis. They also help you understand if a company can sustain its sales and profit growth rates.


Consider return on equity as a gauge of financial efficiency. It basically tells you how well a company is utilizing its shareholders' money and assets in expanding its profitability. IBD calculates it by dividing the most recent annual earnings (excluding special items) by an average of the annual shareholders' equity over the past two years.


Studies of winning stocks over history show that 17% is the minimum ROE for any great company. Make that your minimum for any stock you research.

Margins express how much profit a company makes on each dollar of sales, so they're a crucial metric. Generally speaking, the higher the margin, the better the business. If the ROE is poor, check to see if pretax margin is 17% or higher. IBD founder Bill O'Neil has said that solid pretax margin can offset a company's ROE that's under 17%.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IC041618-300x200.jpg)Pretax margins vary from one industry to another. So look for the companies leading their industries in margins. You can also study margin trends over time. For example, a pattern of shrinking margins can tell you that profit growth may be at risk.


Cash flow is one of the purest measurements of business activity, because it excludes extraneous items that can skew profit figures. Even revenue can be misleading, depending on how a company recognizes sales on its books.


Among the various types of cash flow, the one that matters most for IBD readers is likely cash flow from operations. This offers a good view at a company's incoming and outgoing cash at any given period. Growth companies should generally have cash flow at least 20% higher than annual EPS.


Investors can find these data points at IBD's website and its [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com) charting and research service.


Return on equity and annual pretax margin are shown on stock quotes and Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Cash flow is in the weekly MarketSmith charts.


IBD created the [Sales-Margins-ROE (SMR) Rating](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), which combines those key fundamentals into a comprehensive score. Look for a rating of C or higher. This rating is founds in Stock Checkup, stock quotes and stock tables in IBD Weekly.

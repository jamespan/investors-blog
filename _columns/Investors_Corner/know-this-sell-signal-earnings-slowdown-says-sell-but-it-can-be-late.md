  Know This Sell Signal: Earnings Slowdown Says 'Sell,' But It Can Be Late

In 1950, Yankees star slugger Joe DiMaggio batted .301, his second-weakest average in 11 seasons. The next year his average dropped to .263, his worst ever. DiMaggio weighed the two years of deceleration and retired.


Quality stocks sometimes do something similar.


A stock will be delivering strong earnings growth quarter after quarter. Then it has a bad quarter. One bad quarter alone might not mean much. However, two bad quarters in a row should put an investor on alert.


A bad quarter "usually means a decline of two-thirds or greater from the previous rate – a slowdown from 100% earnings growth to 30%, for example, or from 50% to 15%," IBD Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IC_drys_072417-249x300.png)That's a sell signal, but in many cases a late signal. Trouble usually will show up on the chart well before it shows up in the fundamentals. By the time the sharp slowdown in earnings emerges, many stocks will have flashed sell signals weeks or even months before the earnings reports.


Still, it's good to know the deceleration rule for two reasons.


First, bad things don't always happen on the chart first. Sometimes there are bad surprises on the earnings or sales side first.


Second, investors don't always play a stock correctly. Heeding a late sell signal is better than ignoring it.


In 2006 and '07, Greece-based dry-bulk shipper **DryShips** ([DRYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DRYS)) was a stock-market star. It broke out to 52-week highs in late November 2006 and rallied more than 770% from a 14.99 buy point to as high as 131.34 a year later.


In terms of time, such a run is about average for a leading stock.


When DryShips' earnings stepped up to high gear, quarterly results rose to triple-digit percentages. Beginning in Q1 2007, EPS rose 78%, then 290%, 386%, 484%, 286% and 131%.


In the third quarter of 2008, earnings growth decelerated to 45% — about two-thirds slower than the previous quarter.


The next quarter's results were given March 24, 2009. Q4 2008 profit dropped 94%, a second quarter of sharp deceleration.


Investors who waited until then for the fundamentals' sell signal were looking at a 5.52 stock, well off the high of 131.34 (please see a monthly chart). The pain wasn't over. DryShips fell an additional 68% to 1.75.


The chart was quicker. It signaled "sell" in November 2007, when the stock crashed through its 10-week moving average in fast trade (labeled in red in the accompanying chart as well as in IBD's [weekly charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) on Investors.com, and in MarketSmith) and could not retake the line **(1)**.



On Jan. 16, 2008, investors got another sign, when DryShips' management canceled an earlier plan to split the stock. The market had already done it for them.

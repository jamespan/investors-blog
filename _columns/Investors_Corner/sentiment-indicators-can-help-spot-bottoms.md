Sometimes, the best time to own something is when everybody and his or her brother won't touch it with a 10-foot pole.

This is true for real estate. Just look at prices in Las Vegas now vs. six or seven years ago. Such is also the case in the stock market.

A few IBD tools can help you spot when it's time to take the contrarian view.

When stocks slide day after day and everything is falling to pieces, be bold. Look for a [market upturn](http://leaderboard.investors.com/thebigpicture/ibdetfmarketstrategy.aspx), as marked by a follow-through and new breakouts.

Lows in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are often put in when there are too few bulls are in the market or an overwhelming number of bears. On the other hand, the stock market tends to top when there are too many bulls. It usually means that everybody is already in; no one's left to buy and send the market higher.

The market rallies when things are bleakest. As Baron Rothschild of the British banking clan is alleged to have said, "Buy when there's blood in the streets."

In order to check whether there are too few bulls or too many bears, investors need to look at sentiment indicators. A couple of the most widely known are Investor Intelligence's bulls/bears report and the put-call ratio.

Investors Intelligence puts out its bulls/bears survey each week (see page B16). The report tracks newsletter editors' views. Generally, the market tends to put in a low when the percentage of bulls gets down to less than 35% or when bearishness tops 50%.

Never forget that sentiment indicators can help spot market lows, but always treat them as secondary indicators. Read the [Big Picture](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/701188-sentiment-indicators-can-help-spot-bottoms.htm#disqus_thread) to capture the market's underlying trend.

Investors should also pay attention to crossovers in the number of bulls and bears. Around August and September of 2010, the percentage of bulls crossed below the bears. The ratio of bulls also dropped below 35%. The Nasdaq staged a follow-through Sept. 1, and numerous stock leaders ramped out of bases and made big runs.

The put-call volume ratio, which appears on the same page as the Big Picture column (B8), measures the daily number of put options traded vs. the number of call options. A high put-call ratio, such as 1.2 or higher, is bullish. Why? Fear is rampant. A ratio of 0.6 and below is bearish.

In early October of 2011, the put-call ratio spiked above 1.2 **(1)**. Later that month, the bulls again dropped below 35% **(2)**. The NYSE composite staged a follow-through signal Oct. 12 **(3)**.

Any good investor knows that in the stock market, you make the majority of your money on the long side. The goal of the market is to foster growth and make money. As such, the market ultimately tends to trend upward. But no bull market will last forever.




As the tides change and your percentage invested comes down, you might consider starting a short position to offset your remaining long positions. When it comes to selling short, there is one pattern that stands head and shoulders above the rest, in a manner of speaking.


The Head-And-Shoulders Pattern
------------------------------


The head-and-shoulders pattern consists of three tops, with the middle one (the head) reaching higher than the two at either side (the shoulders).


The left shoulder usually starts after a successful breakout from a base. Your stock will slow and consolidate, finding a new level of support. The head forms when the stock rallies sharply to new highs, before coming right back down, often below the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


This new low will usually occur below a prior support level and helps establish the "neckline" of the pattern.


Finally, the right shoulder develops. You want at least two or three attempts by the stock to rally back above or near the 10-week line, only to find resistance each time. This is critical.


With the drop below the 10-week line or support level, amateur traders see the new low as their golden opportunity. They flood in, attempting to either short on such obvious weakness or pick up a previous winner for cheap.


Although shorting the stock is our goal, shorting off the initial drop can prove too choppy to be reliable. It is best to wait for the stock to complete the right shoulder, let the sellers overtake the buyers and the stock move down in strong volume.


With the pattern confirmed, now is the time to find your entry. If the right shoulder was able to reach above the 10-week line, the ideal entry will be when it crosses back below it, but before crossing the neckline. If not, use the neckline instead. In either case, above-average volume on the decline is key. In some cases, after the right shoulder forms, stocks make a few attempts to regain the 10-week line with no success. A failure from this also can set up a good short opportunity.


Dexcom's Head-And-Shoulders Top

By September, the stock had run up 35% and consolidated.


Dexcom found nearly 14% further profit by November 2021 before plunging 22% in two weeks. With the left shoulder and head completed, the right shoulder began taking shape.


The stock attempted to rally but never could get above the 10-week line. Your ideal short entry would have been in the week ended Jan. 7, 2022, when Dexcom took out the neckline **(1)** with above-average volume, nearly double the week prior. You could have covered your position in following three weeks, for up to a 33% profit.

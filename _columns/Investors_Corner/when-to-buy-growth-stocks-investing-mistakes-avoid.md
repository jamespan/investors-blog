If you really like stone fruits, you wouldn't try to eat a big peach weeks before it fully ripens to juicy, sweet goodness. You might wait until it's fully ready to enjoy.

Savvy investors think the same way about growth stocks. That is, they don't buy before the breakout actually occurs. They patiently wait for the [right moment to buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

## Market Timing And Investing Mistakes

Why wait for a stock to break out? If a highly rated company has gone through the motions of forming a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), won't it eventually advance in price?

Not always. When [a base forms](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), it shows that demand for shares has returned. The heavy selling has abated. Greed is coming back. The "supply" of shares that current holders are willing to dump? It drops.

But you still need mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, large endowments and the like to anxiously grab a ton of shares. This spike in demand fuels a powerful breakout. So if the stock doesn't move past the [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), sit on your cash. Let that potential big winner fully ripen. Then take a bite only when it rises above the [handle in a cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) by at least 10 cents.Â Look for volume to jump sharply as well, at least 40% to 50% above average or more.

## The Set-Up

**Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) formed an attractive [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) after peaking at 138.14 on May 22. The cup portion of the base showed a 22% correction from high to low, a perfectly normal decline. The stock showed some hefty volume as it sprinted higher for three days in a row, doing good work in shaping the right side of the cup **(1)**. What's the hint? Large investors rolled up their sleeves, busily accumulating shares.![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ICfang082018-300x161.jpg)

Now, take a close look at the daily chart. During that three-day run, Diamondback also reclaimed its 50-day moving average, another sign that fear was receding among the sellers and greed was growing among the buyers.

The stock ended a nearly five-week rebound by hitting a new high of 138.25, pennies above the cup's left-side high. A breakout? Nope. Rather, Diamondback cooled off. It formed a five-week handle **(2)**. In that handle, shares fell just 7% to as low as 128.21. Turnover dried up. Again, good action. Why? Only a few holders bitten by paper losses after entering the stock at higher prices were tired of nursing their wounds and got out.

## Before The Breakout

Given all of the positive elements in the base, a new IBD reader may have been tempted to buy shares ahead of the breakout. The idea of trying to save a few points per share is perfectly human and understandable. But the play would have backfired.

Shares dropped 16 points, or 12%, to 117.70 on Aug. 15 **(3)** following news that Diamondback is going to buy fellow oil explorer **Energen** ([EGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EGN)) in a \$9.2 billion deal.

**Make Money With IBD Stock Checkup:**Â [Fourth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/618220/201207251420/make-money-with-ibd-stock-checkup.aspx)

As you consider buying a company's shares, don't forget to look closely at its history.

That's why the [Stock Checkup on Investors.com](http://research.investors.com/stockcheckup.aspx), IBD's website, zeros in on each company's growth over the past three years.

The feature gives you a compounded three-year growth rate for both earnings and sales. While it's critical to have strong gains in the most recent quarters, that's not enough.

IBD's research has found that you also want to see annual increases of 25% or more in EPS and revenue over the past three years.

In Stock Checkup, companies that achieve this level of expansion will get a green light, or passing grade, for the categories labeled "3 Yr EPS Growth Rate" and "3 Yr Sales Growth Rate." This is shown in the accompanying graphic.

Another way to think about this part of the Stock Checkup is that it represents the "A" in CAN SLIM, IBD's investing system. The "A" stands for "annual," as in annual increases in earnings.

Keep in mind what William J. O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, said in his best-seller "How to Make Money In Stocks":

"Any company can report a good earnings quarter every once in a while," he wrote.

"To make sure the latest results aren't just a flash in the pan, and the company you're looking at is of high quality, you must insist on more proof. The way to do that is by reviewing the company's annual earnings growth rate."

But you might be wondering: Is it realistic to demand gains of 25% or more? Isn't that a high bar?

Well, one IBD study found that the leading stocks between 1980 and 2000 mostly met the requirement. The median annual growth rate for earnings was 36%.

A typical EPS progression in, for example, the five years before a stock's big move could be something like 70 cents in Year 1, then \$1.15, \$1.85, \$2.65 and \$4. That example is given by O'Neil in his book.

Plenty of big winners have put up numbers along those lines. Just take a look at some names that have been covered extensively by IBD in recent years, such as **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) or **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).

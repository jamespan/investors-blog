Strong fundamentals, excellent mutual fund sponsorship and relative price strength are all great to see in a stock, but it won't mean much if the general market is acting weak.

The "M" in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system stands for market direction. It's the last letter in the acronym, but it's arguably the most important.

It's a common pitfall among investors: Identify a great stock, buy it, but ignore underlying market health. Before you know it, you're sitting on a loss that could've been avoided.

The best time to make money in stocks is during the early stages of a new market uptrend — after a follow-through day, when fresh institutional money is coming in from the sidelines.

When institutional selling starts to crop up, it can stop the market — and leading stocks — in their tracks.

Of course, [The Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) in the B section gives the most detailed account of daily market action.

The Market Pulse table summarizes current conditions, while the column provides a detailed analysis of the day's market.

Here, you can stay abreast of IBD's market outlook and monitor the distribution day count, which measures recent institutional selling. When higher-volume losses start to cluster, it can be a precursor to more selling.

In 2010, the eurozone debt crisis took center stage and caused big problems for the major averages. Investors fretted about the consequences of potential defaults in countries such as Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain on the worldwide economy.

In early 2010, the S&P 500 rallied a total of 12% in February and March. The good times didn't last long, however, as institutional selling started to make its presence felt.

The S&P 500 slumped 2% in higher volume on April 27, marking distribution day No. 6 of recent weeks for the benchmark index **1** and enough to shift the market outlook in The Big Picture to "uptrend under pressure."

On May 4, the S&P 500 fell another 2% in higher volume **2**. As a result, IBD's outlook was lowered to "market in correction."

LED lighting products maker **Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)) was in a nice uptrend in the early part of 2010 and was a leading stock, with a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 at its peak on April 15 of that year.

But a weak market eventually took its toll. The stock came hard off its high with three higher-volume declines in a four-day stretch from April 16-21 **3**.

Institutional selling eventually made its way into leading stocks. After hitting a high of 83.38 in mid-April, Cree went on to lose 43% over the next five months.

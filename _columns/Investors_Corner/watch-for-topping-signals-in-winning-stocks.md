  Sell Winning Stocks After Weak Rebound From Big Drop

It's usually a relief to see a stock rebound after a big sell-off. But not all rebounds indicate strength.


In cases where a stock has made a big advance, a high-volume sell-off followed by a weak rebound in thin turnover is a signal that it's time to sell and lock in your gains.


In June 2013, **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) made a steep decline after a huge run that began in the summer of 2009.


Investors who had bought in the early stages of the run were sitting on huge profits. They would have been justified in sitting through the consolidation to see if the maker of yoga apparel could resume its uptrend.


In the week ending on June 14, 2013, Lululemon hit a new high of 82.50, then plunged through its 10-week and 40-week moving averages in the heaviest volume since the run began **(1)**. That was a clear sell signal, a time to at least take some profits.


However, those who were still sitting on big gains and decided to hang on anyway would have watched the stock rebound and retake its 10-week line by the week ending on Aug. **(2)**.


**Weak Bounce**


There was a problem: The rebound was sluggish. Volume on the upswing was below average and much lower than it was during the plunge 2, marking another sell signal.


If two warnings weren't enough, the stock again pierced its 10-week moving average and fell 2% in high volume during the week ending on Sept. 13 **(3)**. The fall was followed by a rebound in volume that was again much lower than during the sell-off.


From there, Lululemon rolled over, again pierced its 10-week line and continued falling as volume spiked. By the week ending on June 13, 2014, the stock had hit a low of 36.26 — 56% off its high. Over the past year, profit and sales growth have slowed.


Volume is key in deciding when to sell or buy a stock because it indicates the presence — or absence — of institutional investors who truly have the power to drive a stock higher or lower.


A decline in high volume signals that big mutual funds, hedge funds and other deep-pocketed investors are actively selling, while gains in weak volume point to a lack of institutional support.


Conversely, a stock that falls to a key support line in weak volume and rebounds in heavy volume is showing bullish action. Such activity may sustain a good stock's breakout and long-term uptrend.


Individual investors should take cues from what the big funds are doing, or risk winding up on the wrong side of the trade.


Keep in mind that when it comes time to sell, technical indicators — not fundamentals — play the biggest role.


That's because it's common for leading stocks to plunge weeks or even months before sales or earnings start to show weakness.


In fact, Lululemon posted strong sales and profit growth leading up to its June 2013 sell-off. At the time, its Composite Rating was 98 and its Earnings Per Share Rating was a best-possible 99. (They're now under 75.)


The lesson? Everything often looks great right at the top.

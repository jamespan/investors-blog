If running a company were easy, every startup would become an **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) or an **Exxon** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)).

But gathering talented people, blueprinting a savvy business strategy and executing the plan are maddeningly difficult challenges. Some companies do better than others. Discerning the strongest management from the B and C players is a big part of the investing game.

Earnings and sales growth are the most basic measures of success. For another view into a company's effectiveness at growing profits, look at its return on equity.

Return on equity gauges net income vs. shareholders' equity. It reflects just how well management is growing the bottom line in terms of the company's net worth. Some variations of ROE include return on assets and return on invested capital. But as an individual investor, you don't need to get bogged down by these measures.

To determine ROE, IBD divides net income for the past fiscal year by the average of shareholder equity over the past two years. The ratio is figured into IBD's proprietary SMR Rating.

To calculate the ratio yourself, use a company's balance sheet and subtract total liabilities from total assets. This gives you shareholders' equity. (Many companies do this for you and show shareholder equity in their reports.)

Next, find the annual net income number. Divide this by shareholders' equity. Multiply the result by 100 to get the ratio as a percentage. The ROE figure is included in the IBD 50 tables and the mini-charts in Stock Spotlight, Your Weekly Review and IBD Big Cap 20.

Why is ROE important? The higher the ROE, the more a company sees returned as profit for every dollar of equity. Rising ROEs (against steady or decreasing debt loads) show a company making smart moves, seeing increased returns on its product development or growth strategies or both.

Equally important: Healthy ROE is a proven characteristic of winning stocks. IBD research shows leading stocks tend to hold ROEs of 17% or above at the time they begin winning runs.

An ROE of 30% or higher is exceptional but not necessary. As the table shows, many leaders at the start of the 2009 bull run showed strong ROE.

It's important to compare the ROE ratio and the amount of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Here's why: Increased debt means increased liabilities. An increase in liabilities automatically reduces equity (assets minus liabilities).

That means the same net income number, divided by the reduced equity figure, will create a higher and potentially misleading ROE ratio.

So when a company uses debt to nurture its operations, it tends to boost ROE. So, a high ROE alongside a high debt figure isn't necessarily a positive. A high ROE and low debt ratio are much more encouraging. A low ROE and a high debt ratio are not a good sign.

  Timing Makes A Difference When Investing In Stocks

Would Kirk Gibson's game-winning home run in the 1988 World Series have meant as much if he had hit it in the third inning rather than the final at-bat?  Yes, timing works wonders, and timing is crucial in stock investing.




There is a time to buy stocks, and a time to avoid them. The right time to buy is when the market is in a confirmed rally.


That's when the major stock indexes are moving up after a follow-through day. That's the hallmark of every new bull market.


Some time after the third day of an attempted rally, an index will move up sharply in one session, often 1.7% or more. Volume will be higher than the prior session.


Follow-Through Day
------------------


That's a follow-through day, the most reliable signal that a nascent rally is taking root. It tells investors the market has shifted direction and it's OK to entertain stock purchases. Not every follow-through day starts a new bull run. But no rally has ever started without a follow-through.


The stock-buying season ends when mutual funds, pension funds and other powerful institutions sell heavily. That selling, or distribution, gets recorded on indexes' charts as declines on higher volume than the prior session.


A concentration of three or more distribution days over a few weeks often marks the end of a rally.


Timing On The Chart
-------------------


As far as when to buy specific stocks, the timing also comes down to chart action. A stock should clear an optimal buy point — a price level at which resistance is weakest following a proper base. These tandem principles came together profitably for **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) in the fall of 2005.

The oil-field services company corrected from a split-adjusted peak of 43.90 Aug. 11 (1). The stock pulled back no more than 12% during its base while the general market was having its own correction.


The S&P 500 changed course Oct. 19 (2) when it followed through on the fourth day of its rally attempt.


On Oct. 25 (3), Schlumberger broke out of its base. Shares rallied in step with the market, climbing 54% from its 43.16 buy point until it started a new correction Jan. 31 (4).

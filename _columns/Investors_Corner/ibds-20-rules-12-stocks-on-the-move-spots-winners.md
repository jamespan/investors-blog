Do you like stock tips?

Well, it depends, right? If they're good, who would refuse?

Problem is, no one — repeat, no one — is capable of giving good tips every time.

Meredith Whitney, the former Oppenheimer analyst who showed true courage when she wrote in 2008 that **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) would ditch its dividend, may have gotten her call wrong on municipal bond defaults this year. She certainly won't be the last Wall Streeter to whiff at the plate.

If you want to learn how to fish for nice gains in the market, rather than receive a fish here or there, you need to have a reliable source of information showing which stocks possess uncommon strength and have the potential to break out to new highs.

The Stocks On The Move table, printed most days on B1 and found on the home page of Investors.com, is one such source.

Before a stock breaks out and makes a 20%, 50% or 200% run, it must first show it can rise substantially in heavier-than-usual volume. Such action means that institutional investors — banks, funds, insurers and the like — are greedy for shares and are accumulating positions.

Big gains in healthy turnover help a great stock mold common price patterns such as the cup with handle, flat base and double bottom prior to its big price run.

The table has a column for NYSE stocks priced \$20 a share or higher that have moved up or down at least half a point in volume significantly higher than its average over the past 50 sessions. The Nasdaq features only stocks trading at \$16 or higher.

Stocks that are boldfaced in the table hold EPS and RS ratings of 80 or higher. Circle these names, read about them, and study their charts.

On July 15, 2009, four months into a new bull market, the Nasdaq climbed 3.2% in heavier volume than the prior day. The NYSE shot ahead 3.3%, also in higher trade.

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) made the next day's Stocks On The Move table, listed third from the top. It was boldfaced for its 98 EPS and 94 RS ratings. The Chinese Internet giant's 6% gain in volume 72% higher than normal marked the breakout from a five-week flat base with a 310.35 buy point. By October, the stock gained 42% to a high of 439.90.

Diligent IBD readers studying the same table would have also come across **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)), the fast-growing Latin American e-commerce firm. The stock was boldfaced (90 EPS, 88 RS) and broke out of a nine-week cup with handle with a 27.52 buy point. It doubled by early December.

IBD's new highs list, which groups stocks by broad industry sector, also spots emerging leaders. Also, don't forget about Weekly Stocks On The Move.

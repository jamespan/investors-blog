**Make Money With IBD Stock Checkup:** [First In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/618220/201207251420/make-money-with-ibd-stock-checkup.aspx)

  

Savvy investors know not to rely only on a single gauge or a rating to judge the quality of a stock. Going deeper requires research. Research takes time.

  

A proven way to save time without cutting corners on quality is by using the Stock Checkup function at Investors.com.

  

Using the Stock Checkup saves countless hours poring over financial filings and news articles to determine basic, but critical, fundamental attributes.

  

This proprietary IBD tool delivers a heavy dose of ratings, including Composite, EPS, Sales + Margins + Return on Equity (SMR) and Accumulation-Distribution. But it also gives perspective and data supporting those ratings.

  

One route to get into the Stock Checkup function from the home page: Go to the search box, enter a stock ticker and hit the "Get Quote" button. This delivers you to a page with the stock's chart and various vital signs. It also has a blue box, front and center, that says "Get IBD Stock Checkup." Click on that box.

  

Once there, run your cursor over the color bars down the left side of the page. Each mouse-over produces, in the table to the right, a list of the highest-ranked peers in the industry group according to each specific rating.

  

Below the color bars, you will find additional useful features.

  

To the right of each data point are colored dots, graded like a traffic light: green for good or go, yellow for caution and red for wait. The more green lights, the higher the chance a stock is poised to make a solid price gain.

  

At the top of the list are the General Market assessment (currently "Uptrend under pressure") and the stock's Industry Group Ranking.

  

The "Fundamental Performance" section gives more in-depth detail on earnings, sales, margins and return on equity.

  

"Technical Performance" provides vital technical data including average daily volume, distance from 50-day moving average and distance from the stock's 52-week price high.

  

Next the checkup provides the stock's chart, including volume action and the stock's 50-day or 10-week moving averages. You can toggle the chart between daily and weekly views.

  

The final element: a quick compilation of IBD articles on your stock. These include New America, Internet & Technology and Management page offerings, as well as stories that appeared only on Investors.com.

  

These stories can give you a quick, broad understanding of exactly what the company does, whom it competes with, and what the key strengths and vulnerabilities may be. Such knowledge builds your conviction in a company's growth potential.

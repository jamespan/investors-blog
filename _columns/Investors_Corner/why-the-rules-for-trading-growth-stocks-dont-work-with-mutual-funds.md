  Why The Rules For Trading Growth Stocks Don't Work With Mutual Funds

The kind of driving skills it takes to win a Nascar race aren't appropriate for driving your minivan to the grocery store, even if you are out of cigarettes and beer. Likewise, the type of know-how required to invest in individual stocks the IBD way wouldn't work well with mutual funds.


Yet, IBD occasionally gets email from investors who have been using the Market Pulse to time their mutual fund or index-oriented ETF (exchange traded fund) exposure. This seldom ends well.


In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD Chairman William J. O'Neil devotes a chapter to investing in mutual funds.


He writes, "big money in mutual funds is made by owning them through several business cycles. . . . This means 10, 15, 20, or 25 years or longer. Sitting tight for that long requires enormous patience and confidence. It's like real estate. If you buy a house, then get nervous and sell out after only three or four years, you may not make anything. It takes time for your property to appreciate."


What part of that paragraph says, "Buy a mutual fund and then trade it according to the Market Pulse, moving in and out of your mutual funds several times a year, or maybe even a dozen times a year"?


Or what part of O'Neil's book says, "Take a look at rules derived from market research and then pick and choose the ones you like and apply them in your own customized combinations to your mutual funds. You'll do great."


Quotes like that don't show up in IBD or O'Neil's book.


Handling individual stocks and handling mutual funds are totally different games. Individual stocks may only last for several weeks to several years as a sound investment; that's why IBD recommends exiting when the chart tells you to exit. A well-diversified mutual fund is designed for the long haul, to be held through many market cycles.


There are three things the investor should keep in mind when using this newspaper or Investors.com to invest.


First, the Market Pulse table, presented together with IBD's [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) each day, isn't a Ouija board. The Pulse doesn't predict where the market is going or even how long it will stay in any particular condition. The Pulse is about the present, not the future.


What good is that, you say?


A common misconception is that people make money in stocks by guessing the future. IBD believes you should toss the Ouija-board mentality and focus on the present. Instead, study what sectors and groups and what size stocks (big-cap, midcap, small-cap) are leading the market. The strategy is to increase your odds of winning.


Second, learning the [IBD method](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/getting-started/) for handling individual stocks takes time and hard work. If you are new to the IBD system, you should only risk amounts you can afford to lose. You will make mistakes.


If your primary interest is handling well-diversified mutual funds, read Chapter 18 in the fourth edition of "How to Make Money in Stocks" and when you are done reading it, read it again.


Third, be aware that some narrowly focused [ETFs](https://www.investors.com/category/etfs-and-funds/etf-leaders/) may share more characteristics with individual stocks than they do with a well-diversified mutual fund or even an index fund. They may be more volatile.

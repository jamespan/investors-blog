  To Win In The Stock Market, Keep Your Strategy Simple

Jesse Livermore had a simple approach to investing.


The legendary investor was either in the trade because it was working, or he was out because it wasn't working.


"When I have to depend on hope in a trade, I get out of it because it will only bother me in my trading and I cannot afford to be on anything but live ones," Livermore said.


On another occasion, he said, "There are many times when I have been completely in cash, especially when I was unsure of the direction of the market and waiting for a confirmation of the next move."


And in a third instance, he said, "Don't try to play the market all the time. It can't be done; too tough on the emotions."


Consider the wisdom behind Livermore's stance. He dealt with the reality of his trades, not imaginary hopes. He respected the market trend and waited in cash for confirmation of the market's next move. And he recognized his emotional limitations.


If Livermore's approach sounds suspiciously like IBD's approach, well, that's not an accident. IBD research has shown that many of Livermore's practices were sound.


You simply have to get out of a bad stock quickly. You simply have to respect the market rather than fight it. You simply have to know your limitations. And you simply have to keep it all simple.


IBD stresses these principles repeatedly because they are true. While some investors are infatuated with the newest method or idea, often it is just a tired and defective old idea in disguise.


Most money managers know that admitting to a "fight the market" strategy would be an impossible sell. Very few would step up and say, "Yes, I'd like to invest in your Fight The Market Fund."


Instead, this old, bad idea is refashioned as "staying ahead of the market" or "being contrarian" or "outsmarting the crowd."


As if this weren't bad enough, some people try to sell the idea that you can beat the market by playing two contradictory strategies simultaneously, sometimes involving a long-short strategy or a market-neutral strategy.


Long-short strategies can have many permutations. For some, it means going long with undervalued stocks with improving fundamentals while going short with overvalued stocks with eroding fundamentals. In the case of the market-neutral approach, an equal balance of long and short positions are held.


The promise is that such strategies are a way to either "decrease risk," or "preserve capital" or "profit in a sideways market."


Does all this sound terribly complicated? It is, and that's why self-identified geniuses like it. They can try to show how smart they are.


There's something humble about staying in cash in a tough market. It does nothing for big egos. It stirs no competitive juices.


Yet, is there a quicker way than cash to decrease risk? Is there a more certain way to preserve cash than being in cash?


As for profiting in sideways markets, the prudent investor won't buy stocks in anything less than a confirmed uptrend. Not only are the odds not in your favor in a sideways market, but as Livermore pointed out, such markets will wear on your emotions.


Cash will keep your mind fresh for a new market uptrend.

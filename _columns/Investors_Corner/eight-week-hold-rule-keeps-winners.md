The faster a rocket lifts off from the launch pad, or a baseball flies from the outfielder's hand, the further it will go. So it is with stocks. The ones that blast out of a sound first- or second-stage base during a bull market and make a quick, vertical-like gain are those that have the best chance of being big long-term winners, gaining 100%, 200% or more over many months.


What rule can help you capture such a terrific profit?


The rule to follow: When a stock breaks out and gains 20% or more in one, two or three weeks, it should be held for at least a total of eight weeks. At the end of eight weeks, the investor can decide whether to take his profit or hold for the long haul.


The one exception to the rule is to avoid the round trip. Never let a significant gain turn into a loss.


As noted in the prior two [Investor's Corner columns](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm), investors should take profits of 20% to 25% most of the time. Locking in a steady stream of profits is the surest way to avoid the round trip that many investors experience, even during bull markets. The inexperienced investor smiles as his stocks rise, but he might fail to notice the market is topping. Stocks usually fall faster than they rise, and the gain earned over many months can evaporate in a matter of days.


The reason this eight-week rule works is simple. Something has happened that suddenly and dramatically changes the perception of a company by [institutional investors](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?id=735744&sourceid=735749). It might be an earnings report that reveals much heavier demand for the company's new product or service than previously believed. Or the company has just released its new product or service, and it's clear it's going to be in much demand. Or new markets are opening up.


The big investors want to own the stock and own it now. They believe in the company so strongly they're willing to bid up the price to get the shares they want. They know their competitors feel the same way.


One advantage of the eight-week hold rule is that once the investor has a 20% gain or more, he has a comfortable cushion to let the stock bounce around. Watch volume to see if it shows continued accumulation by big investors. Do pullbacks take place in light volume? Does the stock find support at key price points, such as the 50-day moving average or a round number? Better yet, does the stock refuse to correct and move sideways in a tight fashion?


Best of all, does it continue to advance?


Take the example of Reebok International, a new issue in the summer of 1985. The sneaker maker ran to new highs, then built a 14-week cup-with-handle base later that year. It broke out past a 29.35 buy point (before two stock splits) Feb. 3, 1986, rising 7% on its first day out of the base and 27% in two weeks. That triggered the eight-week hold rule.


Over the next two weeks, Reebok pulled back  **(1).** The gain from the proper buy point shrank to 5.6%. It could have discouraged an investor who didn't adhere to the eight-week hold rule and didn't use charts.


The pullback was on light volume, and the stock found support at its 10-week moving average. From there, the stock galloped higher, gaining 262% in 19 weeks before correcting to form a new base.

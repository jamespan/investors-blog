Imagine driving down a "dark desert highway," cranking up some Eagles tunes, and suddenly you hit a sharp hairpin turn.

Well, you weren't expecting that, right?

When it comes to investing in growth stocks, would you expect similar surprises along the way? Of course. At some point, investors will see this "tree" fall across the road: a huge gap down in price the day right after a beautiful textbook [stock breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

Those are what we sometimes call "expectation breakers."

## What's An Expectation Breaker?

You handle an expectation breaker in the major stock market averages the same way you'd handle it in a car — slow down.

Here are the simple steps to follow. First, stop adding to your positions and certainly don't buy anything new.

Review your holdings. Start by selling all losing positions; out they go. Next, move on to those small gainers. Most of those can get cut loose too.

If you [pyramid up in a stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-in-stocks-pyramid-into-a-winning-position/), study your recent adds. If you got a little carried away and ran up your cost basis, sell those recent follow-on buys to give yourself some breathing room.

Finally, how bad is the expectation breaker?

If it's a mild one, your reaction should be mild. If it's a bad one and you are still too heavy but can't decide what else to sell, consider an across-the-board cut.

## Trim Positions Across The Board

An across-the-board cut is a portfolio management strategy you can consider. It's very handy when you need to reduce exposure quickly, but you don't want to blow out the wrong stock.

Merely sell the same percentage amount of all remaining positions in the portfolio. It's best to do this in small chunks like 5% or 10%.

Next? Stop, take a breath and study the market trend via [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), and examine your holdings. If more selling is needed, continue with another tranche, but guard yourself against overselling. You will be surprised how much clearer you think after you have reduced some risk.

## Market School Rules

When O'Neil Capital Management Portfolio Manager Charles Harris, IBD's Market Research Director [Justin Nielsen](https://twitter.com/IBD_JNielsen) and IBD market strategist Mike Webster were developing IBD's [Market School](https://www.investors.com/product/home-study-kit-market-school/) rules, they stumbled on some rare events where the market would change direction without warning.

To make things worse, we couldn't define black-and-white rules to pick up these days. Luckily, these days would just jump off the chart. It would be nice if all of chart reading was a science. But there is a huge "art" element that will always remain.

## Expectation Breaker Gives The First Sign Of 2007-09 Bear Market

To train your eyes, study the classic "expectation breaker" of Nov. 1, 2007.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IC0ndqc021020-192x300.jpg)The market had been in a very strong uptrend from mid-August until the end of October. The action on Oct. 31, 2007, was key; the Nasdaq sculpted a perfect day, up 1.5%, closing near the highs for the day on a pickup in volume **(1)**. It marked a multiyear closing high. Even a hard grader would give it a solid A+. This left you with the clear "expectation" that the market was going higher. . . a lot higher.

The following day broke all expectations.

Instead of moving higher, the Nov. 1 session started with a gap down and it got worse from there, closing near the lows of the day, down almost 2.3% on a pickup in volume **(2)**. Anyone would give this a grade of F. As it turned out this was the very beginning of one of the worst bear markets in U.S. history.

Expectation breakers come in all shapes and sizes, both in individual stocks and indexes. Your reaction should be proportional to the severity of the broken expectation. Remember, as Eagles frontman Don Henley once said, "You can check out any time you'd like." Well, let's leave out the rest.

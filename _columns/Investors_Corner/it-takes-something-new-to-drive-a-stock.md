While day-to-day price fluctuations are hard to explain, long-term moves in a stock happen for a reason. There's usually some driving force that fuels dramatic moves in a company's shares.


"It takes something new to produce a startling advance in the price of a stock," wrote IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil in the investment classic "How to Make Money in Stocks."


So make sure that there's some kind of positive catalyst behind a company that can send its shares sharply higher. This is essentially the idea behind the "N" in IBD's CAN SLIM investment model, which stands for "new."


Something new could be a revolutionary new product or service. Don't just look for small improvements, but factors that are game changers. It could also be new management, such as a savvy CEO from another company. New can also refer to something that shakes up the industry.


In addition, the new could simply be a new high in its stock price following a breakout.


Practically all of the major stock market winners over time had one or more new factors as they made their stellar runs.


**America Online** ([AOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOL)) gave millions of consumers their first taste of the Internet and online communities. **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) hit it big with its line of Monster Energy drinks. Under the leadership of the late Steve Jobs, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) changed the way people bought and listened to music. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company followed suit with breakthrough products such as the iPhone and iPad.


In IBD, investors can find plenty of features on companies with innovative new products and services, new management and new industry developments.

**3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) was a big winner in 2013, as shares surged 161%. The Rock Hills, S.C.-based firm isn't really new, having started in 1986, nor is 3D printing. But the industry really started taking off in 2013 as more companies recognized the benefits of 3D printing. Plus, 3D Systems and rivals such as **Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) and **ExOne** ([XONE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XONE)) continued to innovate with new types of printers.


Volatile action in 3D Systems made it tough to trade. But the stock went on a tear in the week ended Oct. 11 as it bounced off its 10-week moving average  **(1)**.

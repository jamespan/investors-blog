If you think about a base as a stock catching its breath, then the quickest breather comes when an issue etches a square-box pattern.


The square box just takes four weeks to develop and does not exceed seven weeks. Other types of bases require a minimum five, six or seven weeks.


The square box, a relatively new pattern among the lineup of bases defined by IBD, not only forms quickly but is generally a shallow structure. With a square box, a stock corrects no more than 15%.


William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, first explained the pattern in the fourth edition of his book "How to Make Money in Stocks" in 2009. He wrote: "I've noted this (pattern) over recent years, but finally we've studied, measured and classified it."


**Deere & Co.** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) provides a good example of a stock breaking out past a square box.


The farm equipment giant motored past a 79.76 buy point in early December 2010, and then ended up advancing as much as 25% through early April of this year.


The entry point comes from a square box that began to take shape in early November 2010.


You get the buy point by adding a dime to Deere's 79.66 high reached on Nov. 9, 2010 **1**, or 79.76.


After touching that high, Deere pulled back and consolidated for four weeks, just meeting the time requirement for a square box.


Note how the chart action has a square, boxy look **2**.


The stock found support at its 10-week moving average as it consolidated **3**. So you might have viewed its move as a pullback to the 10-week line. Buying based on that interpretation also would have worked.


The breakout from the square-box base came in the week ended Dec. 10, 2010 **4**. Volume came in above average that week, even if it dipped slightly from the prior week's level **5**.


This base probably is best seen as a third-stage pattern, meaning it was actually a riskier, later-stage structure.


But as you can see, when you have a market-leading stock and a general market uptrend, even some late-stage bases can lead to solid advances.


Deere rallied 22% over the next 11 weeks. Most profits should be taken at 20% to 25%. The stock formed a new, six-week cup base but failed to make much headway. It then corrected 40%.

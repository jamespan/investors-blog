No one can state with absolute certainty when a market top will occur. But keeping track of distribution days can put investors in close proximity.

A distribution day is marked by a loss of 0.2% or greater in the Nasdaq composite or S&P 500 in higher volume than the previous session. This indicates heavy selling activity by mutual funds and other institutional investors.

That's a bearish signal. Why?

Because the big money controls most of the daily trading and, by extension, the direction of the overall market. If funds are snapping up stocks left and right, the market rises. But if they rush for the exits, that results in a sell-off.

That said, a few distribution days during a confirmed market uptrend aren't reason enough to dump all your stocks. First, there are different degrees of selling.

A 0.2% or 0.3% decline in lower-than-average volume, for instance, would be considered mild distribution. But a 1% or bigger drop in above-average turnover that's higher than the prior session is a clear distribution sign.

Second, it depends on how many distribution days occur, and how fast. It usually takes five or six clear distribution days over a few weeks before they pose problems for a market rally.

During a confirmed uptrend, IBD keeps a count of distribution days for the major indexes in the Market Pulse table next to The Big Picture, today on Page B2. When heavy-selling days begin to stack up quickly enough to raise concern, the Market Pulse outlook will change to "uptrend under pressure." That was the case after Tuesday's market sell-off.

If the market worsens, the outlook may drop to "market in correction." This is not an ideal time to make new buys, as three of four stocks follow the market's trend.

Stalling is a subtle form of distribution. A key index that rises but closes near the session low with little price gain suggests underlying weakness. Institutional buyers may be taking advantage of a rising market by selling off stocks.

Tracking distribution days in late 2007 would have helped investors avoid the worst of the 2008 market rout. Heavy selling days racked up ahead of the plunge on the S&P 500, with declines of 0.7% or greater on Dec. 11 **(1)**, Dec. 17 **(2)**, Dec. 27 **(3)**, Dec. 31 **(4)** and Jan. 2, 2008 **(5)**.

Two days later, on Jan. 4, the market sank 2.4% for its sixth distribution day in 25 sessions. The Market Pulse switched to market correction that day. The S&P 500 eventually plunged as much as 53% to its March 2009 low.

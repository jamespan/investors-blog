Every trade that goes on to become a big-time winner starts out as a great idea.

In IBD, you gain access to a barrage of potential trade candidates. One feature that you must check out is the IBD 50.

The IBD 50 is a computer-generated list of top growth stocks. You can count on seeing stocks with strong earnings and sales growth plus solid price action. IN a bull market, these stocks tend to outperform the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 greatly .

A key principle in [CAN SLIM investing](http://education.investors.com/) is buying stocks of companies in leading industry groups with top-notch fundamentals and a special new product or service. But to find these stocks — just to find a single candidate and the underlying story behind its growth — can take hours of poring over financial statements, news releases and stories. You also have to study price-and-volume action in individual stock charts.

Why do all of that when the IBD 50 has done much of the work for you?

The paper publishes the IBD 50 every Monday and Wednesday. [IBD's Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/) updates the list every day. Monday's IBD has the beefed-up version. Besides the mini-charts of the 50 stocks, the long "Inside The IBD 50" column will point you to underlying themes. You can also view the table of the week's 10 best and 10 worst performers.

You'll find two short articles on two IBD 50 companies on Monday. They provide a quick summary of what's driving earnings and sales. It's useful to know the story behind the numbers.

Look for stocks in bases or setting up secondary buy setups such as rebounds off the 10-week moving average or three-weeks-tight patterns. Remember, the IBD 50 isn't an automatic buy list. Always read the brief analysis of the chart action at the bottom of each chart. And make sure the market is in a confirmed up trend before you consider a fresh buy.

**Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)), for example, appeared in the IBD 50 of July 8, 2013, as it formed a flat base with a 29.58 buy point. But that pattern evolved into a narrow cup with handle with a 28.74 entry.

The stock blew past the 28.74 trigger on July 10. Volume was more than twice its average on its breakout day **(1)** and zoomed higher for the week.

Yandex rose 21% by mid-August before pulling back to its 50-day moving average **(2)**. The stock bolted nearly 60% by early January 2014 before topping.

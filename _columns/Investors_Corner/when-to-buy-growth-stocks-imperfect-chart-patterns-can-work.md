A Claude Monet landscape that sells for millions in a London auction house may be considered a perfect work of art. A major league pitcher who goes nine straight innings of no-hit, no-run ball? Perfection again. But breakouts from top growth stocks can still generate vibrant profits even if the chart pattern is, well, not perfect.

How can this be?

The market flashes elements of chaos every day, every week. Not every stock trade, nor every stock tick, takes place under some master's control.

The savvy [CAN SLIM stock trader](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) recognizes this. So, then, what is critical? It comes down to carefully selecting those companies whose chart offers enough evidence that institutional investors are showing very strong net demand.

[A perfect base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/)Â may be less rare than a four-leaf clover. But in many cases, a good chart will communicate this: The big boys and big girls on Wall Street are supporting the stock. They bid it up in price, deliberately and eagerly.

When the [market goes into a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) after a serious correction, what matters most? The present. If a stock is breaking out earlier than others, that's special. And a true surge in volume vs. the 50-day daily average can signal that the complexion of the chart is going to improve even more.

Let's consider the fundamentals side of things. You cannot expect every new market leader to have 99s for Composite, EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings in [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), right? Some companies may show a decent but not great [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-use-the-eps-rating/) because the profit record is still young. Other stocks may have formed such a long base that their RS Ratings got punched down some.

## Top Growth Stocks In 2018: A New Advertising Play

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ICttd110518-300x161.jpg)Consider **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)), the self-service platform for advertisers across all media channels. The stock has popped up in numerous IBD stock lists, including [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).

The stock debuted on the Nasdaq at 18 a share in September 2016, rose for two weeks in a row, then corrected sharply. Notice how the left side of the base featured some heavy swings from the week's low to high. In the week ended Oct. 28, Trade Desk gyrated from as high as 29.47 to as low as 25.44 **(1)**. That's a 15.8% swing.

The entire cup featured plenty of such big moves. Normally, this is a flaw. You want to see tight week-to-week trading, not wide and loose action. So, did the base reveal any positive elements? Yes.

The correction from the left-side high of 33.40 to 22 was 34% **(2)**. That meets the 33%-to-35% decline normal for an [ideal cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). In the week ended Dec. 16, Trade Desk romped 6% higher in sharply above-average trade. Notice how the weekly volume was much sharper than the turnover in two recent down weeks **(3)**.

## Greed, Not Fear

That gave chart readers a subtle clue. Fund managers were getting greedy, snatching lots of shares.

The right side of the cup definitely looks choppy. Yet notice how the 10-week moving average, which began forming in early December, served as a floor of support. And when Trade Desk broke out in the week ended Feb. 17, 2017, shares jumped more than 11% and soared past a 31.35 handle entry that week in the highest volume in more than two months.

At the time, the Ventura, Calif., company reported a 22% jump in earnings per share and a 70% rise in revenue. Earnings had grown 367%, 4%, 80%, 110% and 71% vs. year-ago levels in the prior five quarters.

## Watch For Changes In Chart Scale

As a stock finishes its base, the price scale of the chart may make it appear as if the pattern is wide and loose or too deep. This may especially be the case during an early-stage base. Make sure you use a calculator to determine the true dimensions of the base. The [MarketSmith weekly charts](https://marketsmith.investors.com) use a logarithmic scale.

With the market recovery in its third year, history suggests that choppier action lies ahead.

  

Still, there will continue to be buying opportunities in innovative companies whose stocks have consolidated properly and show potential to make new highs in price.

  

So it will be as important as ever to remember the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing strategy.

  

The N stands for new, meaning that IBD-style investors should look for something new whenever they check out a stock.

  

It could be a new product or service. Or it may be new management, or new industry conditions.

  

**Acme Packet** ([APKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APKT)) has illustrated the importance of recognizing when a company has something new. The firm gets the vast majority of its revenue from sales of what it calls session border controllers, devices that set up Internet calls over landline and, increasingly, wireless phone networks.

  

The SBC market is booming as Internet technology is deployed over wireless networks, said an April 7 article in IBD's Internet & Technology section. (You can read it [here](https://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/568310/201104061721/Acme-Packets-Q1-Looks-Good-Say-Analysts.aspx).)

  

That helps explain the big advance in Acme's stock throughout 2010. It's what you often see for a pioneer in a new and growing field. Better-known examples of it are **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) in the fast-casual eateries sector and **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) in the high-end workout clothing market.

  

So how might you have handled Acme once the 2006 IPO got on your radar screen?

  

A key buying opportunity came in February 2010.

  

That's when — for the first time since a market rally began in March 2009 — Acme had its first successful breakout from a base shaped above 10 a share **1**.

  

Other opportunities came in May and June of that year, when the stock pulled back to its 10-week moving average **2**.

  

Acme went on to make multiple 10-week pullbacks during its monthslong advance. It would have been hard to hold amid its big weekly price swings, but Acme rewarded investors able to hang on.

  

The stock etched a bearish railroad tracks pattern in early March **3**. But it has been behaving well in recent weeks, holding above its 10-week line, clearing a new buy point, and making new highs.

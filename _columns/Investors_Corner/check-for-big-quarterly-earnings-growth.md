The Stutz Motor Car Co. of America, maker of the sleek, aggressive Bearcat, saw its shares surge from \$75 to \$385 in 40 weeks starting late in 1919.


World War I had ended. The government ended its curtailment on motor car production. Stutz sales would more than double in 1919.


The stock's advance shares key traits with hundreds of other great market winners, and with some of the current roster of leading stocks (see the IBD 50 on Monday and Wednesday). One predominant characteristic: accelerating quarterly earnings — two to three quarters of increasing profit growth.


Stutz's net earnings rose 159% in 1919, according to the Commercial and Financial Chronicle of April 3, 1920, even as the company was doubling its capacity. The quarterly gain before the breakout was reportedly 70%.


IBD research of the 600-best performing stocks between 1952 and 2001 showed three out of four reported earnings growth averaging more than 70% in the quarter immediately prior to the start of their winning runs.


The others reported earnings gains averaging 90% in the quarter just after the start of their advances. Generally those earnings gains were accompanied by strong sales gains.


The combination — quarterly earnings acceleration outpacing strong sales growth — tends to show operators who are either operating with financial efficiency or commanding premium prices, or doing both. They are passing a point where more of each sales dollar passes through to the bottom line. That doesn't mean accelerating earnings guarantee a winning stock. But it is a good sign that you're on the right track.


Corporate bookkeeping challenges investors with seemingly countless permutations of earnings: net, GAAP, non-GAAP, pro forma and EBITDA, as well as diluted and undiluted earnings per share. The intricacies are complex, so verify that you are comparing apples to apples when studying quarterly growth.


One way to bypass the hassle is to use tools available through IBD and Investors.com. At IBD, mini-charts like those used in the IBD 50 and Your Weekly Review lists provide the most recent quarterly growth data.


At Investors.com, the Stock Checkup provides an average for the last three quarters' EPS growth, as well as an estimate for the upcoming quarter. The Sector Leaders listings in the NYSE & Nasdaq Research Tables also give a three quarter average and a current quarter estimate.


**Ambarella** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)), No. 19 in Wednesday's IBD 50, launched into its winning run almost immediately after going public in October 2012. Its processing chips, used in Go Pro cameras and other devices, drove earnings growth from zero to 156% in the three quarters before its IPO. That momentum helped lift shares 500% through early January.

On down days or in down markets, some stocks will manage to buck the trend. Investors should pay special attention to these defiant stocks because sometimes they end up becoming big winners.

  

When the market is firmly in the red, stocks that rally in the face of adversity are telling you that buyers want in, no matter what's driving the market down.

  

Sometimes a stock may be bucking market weakness due to specific company news. There could also be something bigger in the works to make buyers step up. Whatever the case, the stock is showing you strength. And it's a bonus if it's doing so in above-average volume.

  

Finding stocks that exhibit uncanny strength in rough markets is easy. There are several resources at IBD that can help spot this.

  

On days when the market is down big, check the Stocks On The Move table at Investors.com and see if any leaders are up in big volume.

  

Likewise, you can also check out the print edition of Stocks On The Move. Stocks that rise in price and have Relative Price Strength and Earnings Per Share ratings of 80 or higher are boldfaced.

  

Another way to look for stocks showing strength is to use the Relative Strength line. The line compares a stock's price performance against that of the market or a market index like the S&P 500.

  

An uptrending RS line tells you a stock is outperforming the market. Sometimes the line will hit new high ground ahead of a breakout from a solid base.

  

When the market headed south in February, **OpenTable** ([OPEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPEN)) fell at first but then traded mostly sideways. On March 10, the Nasdaq tumbled 1.8%, but OpenTable climbed 1.7% 1. Volume was 8% above average.

  

The stock showed its strength again March 16, when the Nasdaq skidded 1.9% to a three-month low. OpenTable rose 0.5% 2, but volume slipped below average.

  

On March 24, when the Nasdaq followed through, OpenTable cleared a 96.07 buy point in a square box on a 59% jump in volume 3.

  

The stock gained 24% in just over a month. Investors using a simple strategy to lock in gains of 20% to 25% could have sold ahead of this week's sell-off.

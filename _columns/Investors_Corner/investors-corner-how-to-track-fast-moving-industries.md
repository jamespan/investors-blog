Change brings opportunity, and periods of turnover among leading industry groups can be a good time to fish for top stocks.

Group turnover often occurs when markets weaken. The result can be an advance among defensive industries not necessarily prone to producing leading stocks.

More often, however, market pullbacks are short. They act as a staging zone for a transition among leading industries. So it pays to cover your bases and search rising groups for potential leaders.

Industry groups advance based primarily on acceleration among their component stocks. You can track this movement using the Industry Sub-Group Rankings Table, found on IBD's "How's The Market?" page (today on Page B2).

Using the table's two left-hand columns, look for industries in the top 40 to 50 among 197 groups that have logged the biggest rise in ranking over the past three weeks. After you find one or more targets, type the name of the industry group into the site search box at Investors.com.

This will give you several articles pointing out a number of stocks in the group.

Next, type the ticker from one or two of the stocks into Investors.com's Stock Checkup tool. The Performance Within Group section will list the leading stocks in the group, based on Composite, EPS, Relative Price Strength and other IBD ratings.

Scan through the charts of these stocks to scout leaders that may be forming bases.

Keep in mind, the group leaders aren't necessarily the stocks driving a group's initial move. This initial push sometimes comes from one or two non-leadership-quality stocks.

The Medical-Products group surged for two weeks to a No. 31 rank in Monday's IBD. Most of that jump owed to moves made by **Heska** ([HSKA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSKA)) and **D-Medical Industries** ([DMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DMED)), small stocks below \$10.

But the advance suggested strength in the group. Closer inspection reveals leaders such as **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **St. Jude Medical** ([STJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STJ)) and **Stryker** ([SYK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYK)) forming bases and pulling back mildly.

Once leading stocks start to move, they propel their group forward. As that occurs, the strength of leading stocks puts the industry group in the top rankings.

Locating rising industries can help you build a watch list before these breakouts start to occur.

Sometimes weak industries will make a big jump, but remain far below the top 50 group.

This isn't necessarily a deal killer. If you find a basing leader with strong fundamentals in a lower-ranked group, check the Relative Price Strength Ratings on other stocks in the group. Two or three stocks with RS Ratings of 85 or higher can be enough to confirm group strength for the first leaders breaking out.

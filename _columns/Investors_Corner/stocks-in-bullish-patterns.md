  Some Leaders Show Good Action But Watch Base Count

A good number of Big Cap 20 stocks are near buy points or in buy zones. Others are showing constructive chart action.


The drawback? Some of the stocks are later-stage patterns.


Generic and branded drugmaker **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) has shaped a flat base. The potential buy point is 133.10. The base, however, is third stage.


As a stock rises, it pauses to consolidate or build a base. Research shows breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later-stage patterns.


**Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) is another late-stage story. The stock is 6% past a 261.85 buy point in a double-bottom base. The breakout came July 12 in strong volume. Few disciplined investors would've bought the stock, though, because the pattern was stage six, according to MarketSmith's pattern-recognition technology.


**Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) broke out of a fourth-stage flat base with an 847.43 buy point. The stock initially cleared the entry in below-average volume July 5, but gapped up in the following session in heavy volume. The stock is 6% past the ideal buy point, but the first valid opportunity to buy came on the gap up.


The fourth-stage base invites argument. Priceline consolidated for 15 months. Sometimes a long consolidation can shake out enough weak holders to serve the same purpose as a base reset.


A long pattern wears out the weak holders, while an undercutting of the previous base's low scares out weak holders. For a breakout to work, strong holders must be in control. Strong holders don't sell merely because a stock hits a new high.


**Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)) has been consolidating since June 2012. The buy point is 75.94, which the stock cleared intraday July 9 in volume 32% faster than usual.


Arguably, there were handles cleared as the stock rose on the right side of the first-stage pattern. But strong volume was lacking in each case. A bounce off the 10-week line in strong volume on June 27 would've been the best early entry, if not for the general market. The market was in correction when Bed Bath & Beyond bounced off the line.


Some stocks will work during a market correction but the odds are so bad that investors should simply avoid buying anything during a market correction.


Bed Bath carries a 97 Composite Rating.


**Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) is climbing the right side of a cup-without-handle base. Unless the stock adds a handle, the buy point is 242.74. The pattern is second stage.


**Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)) gained a penny in slow trade Monday, completing the fifth day of a handle. Five days is the minimum length for a handle. The action sets a new lower buy point at 94.32.


Valeant specializes in dermatology, neurology and oral health. ROE jumped to 37% in 2012, but it has a big load of long-term debt.

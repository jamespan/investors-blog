The L in IBD's [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/) investing system stands for Leaders, as in the best growth stocks based on an analysis of fundamental, technical and institutional sponsorship criteria.

Stocks that meet the criteria of a leader — such as strong sales and profit growth and competition-beating products or services — have the best chance of racking up big gains.

**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), Dell, **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) were among past leaders that became big market winners. Cisco's hardware revolutionized computer networking; Dell beat rivals by selling built-to-order computers at low prices; and Apple dominated the consumer electronics industry with its fashionable and easy-to-use mobile devices.

A more recent example of a true Leader? **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) commands the top shelf in the business of providing fuel cards to commercial vehicle fleets, trucking companies and other firms. The cards help companies track and control costs.

FleetCor was ranked No. 22 in the IBD 50 list of top stocks on Aug. 15, 2012 **(1)**, when it cleared a 41.40 buy point of a first-stage cup base. At the time, the stock boasted a Composite Rating of 98, just shy of the best-possible 99. Its Earnings Per Share Rating was 97 and its Relative Price Strength Rating was 90.

FleetCor's breakout satisfied another key requirement of a leading stock: institutional support. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was A- at the time, indicating strong demand for the shares.

Crucially, volume was more than double the stock's daily average as FleetCor cleared the buy point, indicating that mutual funds and big sponsors were behind the stock's move up. Stocks that don't have the backing of deep-pocketed fund managers can't continue to rise for long.

At the time of its breakout, FleetCor was the leading stock in the Finance-Credit Card Payment Processor industry group, ahead of such stalwarts as **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) and **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)).

Its closest rival is Maine-based **WEX** ([WEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WEX)), formerly called Wright Express. But FleetCor has become the biggest player in its niche thanks to its aggressive and well-executed expansion into Brazil, Britain, Australia and New Zealand. WEX's operations have focused mostly on the U.S.

FleetCor's expansion showed up in its earnings reports leading up to its breakout. Profit rose 28% in the second quarter of 2012, beating expectations, and the company raised its full-year profit outlook. Its annual pretax margin was 50% and return on equity was 25%, both representative of the best stocks.

Though the Finance-Credit Card Payment Processor industry group had fallen to No. 57 from No. 15 in just three weeks, that's still a decent rank. FleetCor still had the characteristics of a winner. The stock went on to triple in 16 months.

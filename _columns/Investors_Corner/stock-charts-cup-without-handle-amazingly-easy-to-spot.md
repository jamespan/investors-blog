  Seeking Bullish Stock Charts? Cup Without Handle Amazingly Easy To Spot

If you think finding bases in stock charts is too hard, try starting with the cup without handle. It is one of the simplest bullish patterns to identify, and it's harbored countless winning stocks over the years.




A U-type shape characterizes the cup without handle: After an advance of weeks or months, the stock will change course and decline gradually. Then, it bottoms out and recovers.


The main difference with its cousin, the [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/), is of course the lack of a handle. Instead of a final pause before the move to new highs, the cup without handle waits for nobody. The stock simply keeps rising from its lows and jumps to new highs.


Just like other proper bases, the cup without handle has its own set of defining dimensions. The stock price falls normally more than 15% but no deeper than 33%. In other words, it doesn't lose more than one-third of its value.


Because it doesn't form a handle, the cup without handle base takes six weeks or longer to form. (The cup with handle needs at least seven weeks.)


Stock Chart Pattern Depth, Length
---------------------------------


Knowing the depth and time length of the cup without handle, you can now go seeking stocks with this formation.


The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) is the same as the prior price high, back where the price decline started. Volume should be at least 40% above the stock's 50-day average. (Stock quotes at Investors.com show you daily volume trends.)


It's also bullish for the base to show signs that institutional investors are crowding into the stock. The price action should be relatively calm, without wide and loose price bars. Up weeks in above-average volume should at least equal the number of down weeks in big volume.


One clean example of the cup without handle could be found in **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) in 2019.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IC083021-300x161.jpg)The chip stock had more than doubled from its December 2018 low when it hit a peak at 35.55 in August 2019 **(1)**. After a quick drop below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), the stock settled down and eventually bottomed at 27.43 **(2)**. That was a 23% total decline.


AMD Stock Chart Led To Big Gains
--------------------------------


AMD's earnings report that October fanned the stock's recovery. On Nov. 4, 2019, shares rose past the 35.55 buy point in a day of sharp gains **(3)**. Volume was 67% above average, well above the 40% minimum for a breakout **(4)**.


The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) made a new high **(5)**, which added to the bullish case for AMD. In about three months, the stock climbed as much as 66% from the buy point.

_Seventh In A Series_

Stocks don't have minds of their own.

The chart patterns they trace are simply reactions to buying and selling. The bulk of that is created by large institutions, and sometimes the companies themselves buying back their own shares.

This is why you look for bases demonstrating an even temper. Bases with erratic trading, wide and loose action or price spikes and dives suggest a rogue stock; no one is really in control.

Smooth trade and tight closes often indicate that institutional investors are at work, methodically creating a situation of short supply in a company's shares, laying the groundwork for a stock to break out to higher ground.

A stock starts to correct and build a base when one or more large investors liquidate holdings. Such investors move in and out of stocks for multitudes of reasons. It doesn't mean the stock will no longer gain value.

When existing investors move out of a healthy stock, the price dip creates a buying opportunity for new funds to set up shop. Funds already in the stock often use the opportunity to add to their position, giving the stock price support at key levels such as the 10-week moving average.

The managers of these funds aren't looking for a thrill ride. Volatility's for kids. A balance between distribution and accumulation provides predictability; it means everyone can sleep at night.

Astute IBD readers looking for good bases like to see controlled price movements. Tight weekly closes in a well-sculpted cup are a beautiful thing. V-shaped bases or "iceberg" spikes that fracture a base pattern are signs of conflict in who is in control of a stock's price.

This was the case with computing pioneer **Hewlett-Packard** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) in the third quarter of 2003.

The stock had tumbled for two years following the dot-com crash. It bottomed and began climbing in fits and starts in October 2002.

A base got under way in July 2003. On July 25, the stock dove 6%, then recovered above its 10-week moving average. That's more drama than you'd like, but a healthy finish. On Aug. 19, the stock stabbed 8% higher, then reversed and closed a bit lower and at the bottom of its trading range.

On the following day, the company reported third-quarter earnings that were 12% below expectations. Shares dropped 10% in massive trade.

HP moved ahead to form an otherwise orderly base. But the volatile week stood out like a red flag **1**. That was an iceberg formation.

The stock formed a handle, then broke out in early January 2004 **2**. It gained only 10% through the end of January, then faltered 39% through the following August.

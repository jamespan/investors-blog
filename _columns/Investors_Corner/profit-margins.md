Sales growth is an important gauge when picking stocks. But sales mean very little if they don't produce a profit.

If a company has a 25% profit margin, then it nets 25 cents per dollar of sales. Your child's must-have toy of the season retails for \$25 and only costs \$5 to manufacture. That's a profit margin of 80%.

The higher the margin, the better. But you still don't have the entire picture until you compare a stock's pretax margin to others in the same industry.

For instance, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) was one of the biggest losers in 2022, despite a 40% margin. **Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) was among the biggest winners that year with pretax margin of 17%.

Thus, check a company's margins against its peers to get an apples-to-apples comparison.

A stock's profit margins should be accelerating as well. Like a stock's earnings per share, accelerating profits over the last three quarters can be indicative of a stock's potential strength.

You can find this in [IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) by going to the list section of the tool and selecting the list panel tools (on the wrench icon). Then select Customize Column Layout, which will bring up a series of options. Under Margins & Ratios, click AT Margin Accel. Drag the box into the Layout Preview and hit Apply.

## Use IBD's SMR Rating

IBD's proprietary [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-smr-rating-examines-factors-that-drive-profits/) does the heavy lifting for you. This data item combines into one simple A-to-E rating system, four fundamental factors commonly used by analysts:

- Sales growth rate over the last three quarters
- Pretax profit margins
- After-tax profit margins
- Return on equity (ROE)

Sales growth and after-tax margins are computed with quarterly figures, while return on equity and pretax margins are calculated using annual figures.

For the quickest way to find a stock's SMR Rating, use the IBD Stock Checkup. Enter your ticker and it will return with the stock's SmartSelect Ratings:

- Earnings per Share
- Relative Strength
- Accumulation/Distribution
- Sales, Profit Margins, and Return on Equity
- Industry Group Relative Strength

Each rating includes its rank within the industry group and component data. All information is color coded for easy at-a-glance analysis.

## Your Day In The Sun

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IC022023-279x300.jpg)In April 2019, **SolarEdge Technologies** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) finished a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). Looking up its pretax margins, you would find 14% from the fourth-quarter 2018 earnings report.

Around the same time, another leader in the solar energy group, **First Solar** ([FLSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLSR)), had a pretax margin of -13%, meaning costs were higher than revenue.

While First Solar was beginning to drift sideways, SolarEdge finished a short handle shakeout and gapped up, hitting a 20% gain immediately following the early-May earnings report.

With that much cushion, you could have very easily held until August, when the stock jumped again. By January 2021, SolarEdge had topped at a 774% gain from the April 2019 cup breakout. First Solar ran up 74% in the same time.

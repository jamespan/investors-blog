Being called flat, dull or boring isn't such a good thing. But a stock that's creating a flat base is worth your keen attention.


Why? This key pattern can set the stage for the next leg up.


Like its name suggests, the flat base is flat. It should look like a rectangular box with a high-to-low correction of no more than 15%. The stock looks like it's just going sideways, not doing much.


The flat base is one of CAN SLIM's shorter patterns. It only needs a minimum five weeks to take shape vs. seven weeks for the cup or double bottom. To count the number of weeks, typically start counting from the first down week after a high.


The pattern usually has a defined trading range. There's a price level where the stock will back off as well as an area where the stock gets support. Think of it as having a ceiling and a floor. Investors can draw separate horizontal lines connecting the highs and lows to better see the pattern.


The buy point is 10 cents above the left-side high. As always, turnover should be at least 40% above average when a stock busts out of the consolidation.


The flat base is usually not a first-stage structure. It tends to form after a stock breaks out from a prior pattern such as a cup or double-bottom. This makes sense as the sideways action of a flat base marks a digestion period for the stock.


During market corrections, stocks that vacillate and form flat bases are actually showing you strength. They are not going down like most other issues under tough market conditions.


With the market currently in a correction, **SXC Health Solutions** ([SXCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SXCI)) is in a flat base with support at its 10-week moving average. Internet auctioneer **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) is also in a flat base.


In early 2005, **Tenaris** ([TS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TS)) shaped a flat base **1**. The steel pipe maker had broken out from a cup with handle in August 2004.


Tenaris' flat base was 11 weeks long; it corrected just over 13%. The pattern was a little lopsided, but there was clearly a floor at 45.


The stock cleared the 51.80 buy point in the flat base Feb. 2 (a weekly chart is shown) **2**. Turnover swelled 364% above average that day, leaving no doubt that a breakout occurred.


It popped 31% by early March, tested its buy point in April, and resumed its big run .

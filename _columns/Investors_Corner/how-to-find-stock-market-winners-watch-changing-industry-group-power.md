If you want to find big stock market winners, do this. Learn how to track sector rotation.




Doing so can help you pinpoint which industries are just beginning or likely to continue to see heavy buying demand. And finding the industries that are gaining real strength can lead to profit opportunities for individual investors.


One key to tracking this important movement of institutional money is monitoring changes in the daily 197 Industry Group rankings. IBD's rankings compare the relative price performance of each industry group or subgroup with all others over a six-month period. *(To see the entire rankings at Investors.com, go to [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in the Stock Lists section.*)


An industry group that jumps from the bottom third of the rankings to the top 40 — or even top 10 — is being driven higher by intense and relentless institutional buying. Investors should typically focus on the top few stocks in these top groups to maximize the chances of finding a big stock market winner.


For example, the Retail-Major Discount Chains  group ranked No. 9 as of Monday's market close. It has moved up a solid 15 spots within the daily revised rankings over the last six weeks, after being ranked No. 24.


Potential Big Stock Market Winners, Including Teradyne
------------------------------------------------------



However, the search doesn't stop there. The idea is to find the best stocks within the leading industry groups. And "best" is determined not just by technicals, but by fundamentals as well.


The discount retail industry shows only a couple strong EPS Rating and RS Rating stocks. Perhaps the best stock within the group is top-ranked **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)). In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales grew 14% and 8%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period.


Dollar General stock surged above a 145.16 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) [on Aug. 29.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/dollar-general-stock-dollar-tree-earnings-burlington-stores-stock/) The stock's [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) was a bullish price move.


Two other industry groups with big jumps in the rankings over the last six weeks are Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment — from 34th to 12th — and Insurance-Diversified — climbing from 46th to 8th.



Within the semiconductor equipment group, **Teradyne** ([TER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TER)) is the [No. 1-ranked stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-teradyne-inc-ter.aspx) with a 98 of a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. The [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics.


Teradyne stock is shaping a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 58.71 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares are within striking distance of the entry.



In the Insurance-Diversified group, **American International Group** ([AIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIG)) is one of the top ideas with an [89 IBD Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-american-intl-group-aig.aspx). The top insurance company is shaping a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 57.69 buy point in today's stock market.

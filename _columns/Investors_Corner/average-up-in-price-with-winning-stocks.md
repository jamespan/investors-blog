At the poker table, going "all in" is a risky move. The same holds true in the stock market. On the surface, the processing of buying a stock might seem simple. You have, say, \$10,000 to invest. You could buy enough shares to absorb that entire amount in a single purchase and hope for the best.

  

But there's a lot more to it than that.

  

Buying a stock properly, managing the position and capitalizing on a big market winner is a whole other story. Rather than immediately create a full-size position, you can buy in parts, adding shares only as the stock rises further past a [proper buy point](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx).

  

A stock will always tell you when to add to a position, when to sit tight, and when to cut bait. There's no sense in adding to a position when the stock isn't working.

  

With \$10,000 to invest, don't go all in at once. Instead, start by investing \$5,000 when a high-quality growth stock first breaks out from a base. You don't know if it's going to work, so why bite off more than you can chew?

  

If the stock rallies 2% to 2.5% past the buy point, add another \$3,000 worth of shares. Then, if it rallies another 2% to 2.5%, add the final \$2,000 to the position.

  

The process is known as pyramiding, or averaging up in price. Few investors do it because it's counterintuitive. Most average down in a stock that isn't working, thinking they're getting shares on sale. But this can be very hazardous in a weak market; it's like throwing good money after bad as the stock keeps falling.

  

**Alaska Air Group** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) began a long run to new highs in October 2012. When the stock broke out, a \$5,000 investment could have been made when the stock cleared a cup buy point of 38.56. When shares rose 2% and hit 39.33, another \$3,000 could have been funneled into the stock.

  

When Alaska climbed another 2% to 40.10, a \$2,000 stake would have filled out the position for an average per-share cost basis of 39.09. Buying a smaller amount of shares as a stock is rising keeps your average cost basis in check.

  

While Alaska Air was bought three separate times, the average cost basis ended up just 53 cents higher than the first buy. A position was built while the stock was still in a buy range, too. Remember, never chase a stock when it moves 5% past a buy point.

  

Alaska Air rallied nicely over the next couple of months. Those who bought at the breakout had a profit cushion when Alaska Air paid a visit to its 10-week moving average in early January 2013 **(1)** . Adding a small number of shares to the position was sound strategy, especially since the stock found support at its 10-week line in heavy volume. With 255 shares bought at the first breakout, another \$2,000 investment at 42.50 would have lifted the average cost to 39.62.

  

From there, Alaska Air rallied to a high of 68 in May **(2)**. The position at that point was worth \$20,740, up 71%.

  

A key IBD sell rule is to take a 20% to 25% gain in a stock if you have it, so some might have decided to close the position earlier. Those with conviction in the stock gave it more room to run. A massive distribution week during the week ended May 24 **(3)** was an unequivocal sell signal for those still holding the stock.

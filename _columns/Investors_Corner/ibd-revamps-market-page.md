A longtime IBD staple has just undergone a face-lift.

The stock index charts page (see B2 in today's IBD), called "What's The Market Trend?," was reshaped this month with a fresh way to study the market.

The basic frame hasn't changed. Large price-and-volume charts of the major indexes, the IBD Mutual Fund Index and other market data are still there.

But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 daily charts are now even bigger. They illustrate nearly a full year of daily price and volume activity, giving investors a wider lens on the market.

The line graph plotting the put-to-call volume ratio also was lengthened to match the index charts. It now sits directly below the Nasdaq and S&P 500 charts, which makes it easier to compare this contrarian indicator to the market's behavior.

The ratio compares to the number of generally bearish put options traded vs. bullish call options. When the ratio hits 1.10 or higher, it's usually a sign of strong bearishness among options and equity traders.

Peaks in the put-call ratio are now highlighted with blue arrows (highs) and red arrows (lows). Those are significant, because they often coincide with changes in market direction. In particular, the highs in the ratio have been near market lows this year.

The lists of the 40 best and 40 worst industry groups are staying, although they now display some color highlights. If a group was among the day's 10 best of IBD's 197 industry rankings, it is printed in blue; if it was in the bottom 10, it is in red.

The full list of 197 groups runs in the Monday edition. It's available every day at investors.com. Using the mouse, hover over the "Research" tab in the main navigation bar, then click on "IBD's 197 Industry Groups."

The chart of the Dow Jones industrial average maintains its old size, covering six months. This de-emphasizes the venerable average, which represents just 30 major companies and is not a good gauge of growth stocks. But the Dow remains an important barometer of U.S. companies, and its chart deserves to be on the page.

The IBD Mutual Fund Index also is staying on the page. It combines 20 of the most respected mutual funds in the U.S. The index provides a look at how some of the best stock pickers are doing. As such, it can be viewed as a sophisticated advance-decline line.

So, what about The Big Picture? The column, today on B3, that analyzes the market each day now appears on the page adjacent to the charts page.

Just because it is on a different page doesn't mean it has any less importance. The Big Picture is mandatory reading for growth investors and market watchers.

Two tables — the IPOs with best price change and the best performers on the IBD 50 — stay on "What's The Market Trend?" They identify leading stocks that could become superb investing opportunities.

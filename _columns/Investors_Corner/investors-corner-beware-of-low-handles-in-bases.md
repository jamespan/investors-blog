One of your top jobs as a stock investor is not only to see what's great about a stock, but to find the flaws. Today we'll examine the low handle, the sort of flaw that can presage an expensive mistake.

  

A handle often forms on cup, double-bottom and saucer bases that show healthy accumulation by the big guns of the market. It should slant lower along the lows and form in quiet volume.

  

The handle also represents that quiet time before funds, banks and other large buyers aggressively chase a stock higher.

  

Why is it important that the handle be in the upper half of the base?

  

First, to be in the upper half is yet more evidence that the funds are lending support to the stock. The handle reflects weaker, impatient hands selling the stock before the action really begins.

  

The real test is how far the funds will allow the stock to fall during this time before they step in to buy those unwanted shares.

  

If they wait too long, and let the stock fall too much, you're looking at a picture of unaggressive buyers â€” not what you want to see.

  

The second reason is based on empirical evidence. IBD's study of bases has found that low handles carry a higher risk of failure. If such a stock tries to break out while still far below the high of the base, it faces a potentially large raft of motivated sellers who bought at higher prices and want to cut their losses in the stock.

  

Here's how you determine the handle's position relative to a cup. Take the midpoint of the cup (intraday high plus intraday low, then divide by two) and the midpoint of the handle (ditto). The handle's midpoint should be the higher of the two.

  

Let's look at ECollege.com, an online university, as it traded in 2003-04. The stock started to form a cup on Nov. 6, 2003. **1** Now look at that action from Jan. 28, 2004, through Feb. 5. That's a handle. ECollege blew past the 20.70 buy point on Feb. 6 with double-paced volume. **2**

  

Let's do the math. The cup's midpoint is (26.71 plus 15.62) divided by 2, which equals 21.17. The handle midpoint: (20.60 plus 17.34) divided by 2, which equals 18.97.

  

ECollege's gains from that breakout were short-lived, followed by a steep, high-volume decline to 6.04 in six months.

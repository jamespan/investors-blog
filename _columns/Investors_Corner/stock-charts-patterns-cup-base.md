One skill in a successful investor's arsenal should be basic chart-pattern identification. With only a handful of tried-and-true chart patterns to master, the [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and a variation called the cup-without-handle base should be at the top of your list.

Chart patterns can identify a stock before it makes a major advance, and they can pinpoint a precise entry for maximum profit. As with other stock chart patterns, these two similar bases form after a stock has run up at least 20% to 30% and takes a needed break.

The cup-without-handle base is a form of the more commonly found cup-with-handle base. Both have a U-shape, but the cup-without-handle base powers higher without pausing on its way to new highs.

In contrast, the cup-with-handle base stops its recovery short of new highs and pulls back for at least a week, creating the handle portion.

IBD research shows the cup-without-handle base can have a higher failure rate than its cousin. Yet, in any given bull market, dozens of winning stocks get their start with a cup without handle.

## Cup Without Handle Stock Charts

A proper cup without handle must be at least six weeks long, though it can last for months. The cup should be no deeper than 33% from top to bottom.

The buy point is the stock's prior high before it forms the U-shape, almost always at the beginning of the base. As in other base breakouts, the buy zone goes from the buy point to 5% above it.

In addition, the breakout [volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) should be at least 40% above the stock's average over the past 50 days.

[IBD MarketSurge pattern recognition](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) identifies both types of bases on daily and weekly charts.

## American Superconductor's Stock Chart

**![amsc american superconductor](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IC072924-300x167.jpg)American Superconductor** ([AMSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMSC)) formed a cup-without-handle chart pattern from March through May **(1)**, crafting a smooth U-shape with a 25% decline.

Shares broke out past the 15.24 buy point on May 22 **(2)** in volume that was more than double its average **(3)**.

The stock powered higher four more weeks from the breakout until taking a break in mid-June. To a peak on July 16, shares soared 114% from the breakout.

American Superconductor has multiple businesses, including design of wind-power turbines. It helps manage the electric grid and provides ship propulsion and power-management systems. The company had its first annual profit in the fiscal year that ended in March.

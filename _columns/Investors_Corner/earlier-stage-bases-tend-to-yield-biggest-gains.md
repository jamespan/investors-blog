When looking for potential stocks to buy, your best bet is to stick with those building early-stage bases.

Why? Leaders tend to make their biggest moves as they break out of early-stage patterns.

An institutional-quality stock's first breakout from a sound base can easily result in gains of 20% or more gains during a market uptrend. The odds of success with second-stage bases are still fairly high, often resulting in another advance of 20% or more.

But by the time they form third-stage and later bases, there might not be as much gas left in the tank, raising the risk of a failed breakout. After a lengthy and sizable run-up, savvy mutual funds and other big players that helped propel the stock higher will likely look to start unloading shares.

Before the first base forms, a stock must always show a prior uptrend of at least 30%. Also, if it has not risen 20% from a proper base buy point and then forms a new base, count the two bases together as one base.

When a stock starts to act differently at its breakout — it hesitates and falters instead of surging in big volume — that's a red flag.

That said, there are a few exceptional leaders that can defy the odds and still knock out a productive breakout from a third-stage or even later base. Such stocks should continue to display truly strong fundamentals and sound chart action amid a bull market.

**Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) has consistently notched double- or triple-digit quarterly profit growth and 39%-or-better sales gains since its public debut in late 2011 debut.

Shares of the former "Project Runway" judge's namesake company cleared an ultrashort IPO base just weeks after their December 2011 debut and rallied 153% in less than three months of trading. The stock paused in March 2012 to start work on its first true base **1**, a five-month cup with a 50.79 entry, which it cleared the week ended Aug. 17 in heavy trade.

The stock didn't take off. Instead, it moved mostly sideways, eventually rising as much as 15% before shaping its next base **2**. This was the second part of a base-on-base formation.

Kors broke out again, but didn't rise much. Instead, it continued to add to its prior base-on-base construction. Finally, an eight-week cup with handle **3**, still part of that initial base on base formed in the first half of 2012, delivered. The stock rallied 30% from its late-July breakout past 65.21 before starting a new flat base in late December.

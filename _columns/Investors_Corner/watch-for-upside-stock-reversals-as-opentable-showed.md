**How To Spot A Fine Chart:** [Third In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/609681/201204301622/how-to-spot-a-fine-chart.aspx)

When searching for a good-looking stock chart, it's smart to keep an eye out for upside reversals.

This refers to a stock recovering from a decline to finish near a high — either a daily high or a peak for the week.

Quite simply, it shows investors mostly have a sense of conviction about that stock.

Some of them are viewing the stock's latest decline as a chance to buy at a good price, rather than as a signal to bail out in droves.

It's especially nice to see positive reversals during a base-building effort. This reflects a stock finding a bottom before resuming its advance.

**OpenTable** ([OPEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OPEN)), which provides a Web-based restaurant reservations service, executed several upside reversals in early 2011 as it consolidated.

Look at the stock's consolidation in February and March **1**. You could view this five-week pattern as a square-box base, or perhaps a flat base. The decline was limited to 15%, so in either case, the buy point would have been at 96.07 **2**.

The base showed several upside reversals.

For four straight weeks, the stock sold off early in the week, found support at its 10-week line, and then rallied to finish at its high for the week **3**.

If you were watching this base take shape ahead of buying the stock, and noting the repeated upside reversals, you may have felt a thrill going up your leg, to borrow a phrase from TV personality Chris Matthews.

In any case, your chance to pounce came in the week ended March 25, 2011 **4**. OpenTable surged past the 96.07 entry that week in convincing turnover.

The stock climbed as much as 23.5% beyond 96.07 before starting a long, steady decline.

With this stock, it would have been smart to deploy the IBD sell rule that calls for exiting a position once your profit hits 20%. After all, OpenTable had already enjoyed a big advance since coming public in May 2009. Its latest base counted as a late-stage pattern, meaning it's a riskier buy.

If you had waited for the stock to slice through its 10-week line — another sell sign — you would have given up a lot of gains.

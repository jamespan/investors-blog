Stock bases are like cats.


The young ones can jump higher and run longer than their aged counterparts, who may try to keep up but will likely just peter out.


This is why you should look for younger bases — specifically, stocks building a first- or second-stage structure. A third-stage base isn't necessarily old, but you should be aware that the risk of failure is rising.


A fourth- or later-stage base reflects a stock that has had a long run and is now pushing its luck. Or you're pushing your luck by buying it. Why should this be so? Isn't a valid base reason enough to buy a stock, no matter what stage it might be?


No. A stock that's building a late-stage base already has some impressive gains under its belt.


What's more, those gains have accumulated over a considerable amount of time, probably more than a year. As it forms a fourth-stage base, the winnings enjoyed by some big funds are already quite large. The position is getting old.


At some point, big funds will jump on the opportunity of a breakout to start unloading their positions into an eager market. How will you know this is happening? Easy — the stock's breakout will wobble. Its behavior will look odd for a stock that you expect to be chased higher.


It will fail. It will fall.


Look at **China Mobile** ([CHL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHL)), the mainland's No. 1 provider of wireless and data services. As the monthly chart shows, the stock's top in October 2007 was preceded by at least four bases, including base-on-bases as a single structure.


At its top, the company's story was incredibly compelling. It still is. In a vast land with 1.3 billion people, with much of that population on the move, communication is a vital need. Add to that the emergence of a new consumer class, and it's easy to see the allure of a company in the business of providing wireless service.


From 2005, China Mobile rose from four clear bases, including a base-on-base, on its way to the Oct. 29, 2007, peak at 104.


That peak was marked by several symptoms of a climax top. But you should have been looking for something to go wrong at that point. The base that China Mobile tried to build that November would have been a fifth-stage affair **1**. It never got off the ground.


Certainly, not all late-stage bases fail. In investing, you're trying to maximize your batting average. Research shows late-stage bases will hurt your average.

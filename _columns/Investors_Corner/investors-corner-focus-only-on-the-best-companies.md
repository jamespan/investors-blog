_Eighth In A Series_

What did your mother always tell you? You deserve only the best. So when you go out for sushi to celebrate, would you go to the bargain places, half-off tuna with coupon?

You deserve the best-quality sushi — and the best stocks. Years of IBD research show that bargains are no bargain. You're best off sticking with the cream of the crop, by fundamental and technical ratings.

Much of your analysis should focus on the difference between the leaders and the laggards. If someone asked you which you'd rather own, naturally you would prefer the leaders. But sometimes you're tempted to buy the laggard.

Suppose that great stock you had been watching gaps higher and flies away without you. You find yourself looking for the next best thing. You find something that's making a profit but not as much as the leader you missed. Maybe there's a base to buy from, but it's not as good as the one you missed.

And while that first stock is soaring, this one may be rising modestly, or not at all. It's not a bargain. It makes more sense to continue watching the true leader for new bases and follow-on buy points.

How long had you been watching Internet search engine **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) in 2006? The stock debuted on the Nasdaq two years earlier and made near-relentless gains. The stock then started moving sideways in January 2006, building a series of ever-tighter cup-type patterns.

Volume dried up for the most part during this nine-month base-building effort. Now consider Google's ratings at that time: 98 EPS, B+ Accumulation/Distribution, and A for SMR. Its Relative Strength Rating was a mediocre 52. No wonder it was so low: The stock had been coiling for nine months.

Google broke out from a cup with handle Oct. 6, although volume did not impress **1**. Google went on to build a second handle and broke out with a vengeance Oct. 20 **2**.

Compare Google with **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) (see [chart](/NewsAndAnalysis/PhotoPopup.aspx?path=WEBcorner0720.jpg&docId=578764)) as they both looked on Oct. 6, 2006. Yahoo showed an EPS Rating of 83. Its RS rating of 7 showed just how done the stock was.

Google rallied 71% over the next 12 months as Yahoo trended lower.

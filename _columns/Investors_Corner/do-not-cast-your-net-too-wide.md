With thousands of stocks on the major exchanges, choosing good trading candidates can be a daunting task. Luckily, computer screens simplify the search process.

  

Screening lets you find stocks within seconds. But even with the help of stock screens, you don't want to cast the net too wide. The [CAN SLIM investment methodology](http://education.investors.com/) is about trading institutional-quality stocks, so you need to filter for those that meet certain price and volume requirements.

  

When you build stock screens, you need to set forth some minimum criteria. Remember, you don't want to play in the pool of the lower-quality stocks. Scour the landscape for stocks that the big guns, such as hedge funds and mutual funds, play in.

  

In the stock market, everything tends to sell for what it's worth. There are good reasons why shares of some companies sell for pennies a share, while other companies have stock prices that run into the triple- or quadruple-digit territory. Firms in the latter group have top-notch products and services in the market. They are growing earnings and sales at a healthy pace.

  

Stocks of companies with low share prices tend to be either laggards, have weak growth rates, or suffer falling earnings and sales. They might be young companies with no established products and services.

  

With that said, investors should screen for stocks priced at \$10 a share and higher. Don't focus on the lower-priced issues just because you can buy more shares.

  

Would you rather own four jalopies or one high-performer?

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) all trade in triple-digits. Why? These companies continue to deliver innovative products and services and grow their earnings and sales. All three are heavily owned by institutions.

  

Ideally you should screen for stocks that trade at least 400,000 shares daily on average. [Daily charts](http://research.investors.com/ibd-charts.aspx?cht=pvc&type=daily&symbol=0NDQC) on Investors.com uses a 50-day average. Just left click on the price bar to get the figure. Spot the average-daily volume figure on the mini charts throughout IBD. You should deal in stocks with ample liquidity. This shows that plenty of players have interest in the stock.

  

Also, with more liquid names, it's easy to get in and out if necessary. Thin stocks are generally more volatile and will have a larger bid-ask spread. Investors have to pay up to buy the stock and receive a lower price to sell, as there just isn't much interest in it.

  

If a stock doesn't trade at least 400,000 shares daily, you can check out its average-daily dollar volume. Just multiply the price of the stock by the average number of shares traded each day. The product should be at least \$20 million to \$25 million; the higher, the better.

  

Average dollar volume is taken into account for stocks that appear in [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com), the IBD service launched in 2011.

  

In order to do your own screening, you'll need either software or have some kind of Web-based service. [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com), which requires a separate subscription, has very powerful screening capabilities. Investors can choose from a wide variety of fundamentals and technical factors. It also has a number of pre-built stock screens.

  

Investors.com has [Screen Center](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?nav=ResearchSC), which has a rotating list of stock screens.

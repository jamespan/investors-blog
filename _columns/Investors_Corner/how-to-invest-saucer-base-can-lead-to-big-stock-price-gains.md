Savvy traders know that spotting breakouts from base patterns such as the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/) is a key part of learning how to invest.




Its relative, the [saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakout-stocks-predict-breakout-with-saucer-with-handle-base-chart-pattern-amazon/), is a less common pattern that can also yield powerful gains. They share some common traits. Both the cup and saucer form a U-shape, then add a handle, over a period of at least seven weeks.


The primary difference is in the depth of the base pattern. A cup, which implies a deeper U-shape, usually pulls back between 15% to 33%. Since saucers are shallower than cups, it makes sense that the correction in a saucer tends to run from 12% up to 30%.


While the saucer with handle can take shape in as little as seven weeks, it often takes much longer. In rare cases, it can even take up to a year.


Viewed on a stock chart, you'll see the chart for a saucer will trace a shallow U-shape with a slight dip â€” if a handle forms. Not all cups or saucers will add a handle.


How To Invest: The Handle
-------------------------


The handle results as a stock builds the final stages of the base, then pulls back in a secondary price decline before a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). It should form in the upper half of the overall base, be at least one week long and drift slightly downward. Ideally, volume will dry up as the handle forms.


To get the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), add 10 cents to the highest point in the handle. If the saucer doesn't form a handle, add a dime to the prior high of the pattern, where the base started.


Blackstone's Saucer
-------------------


**![Blackstone](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IC111521-300x161.jpg)Blackstone Group** ([BX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BX)) offers a fairly recent example of a saucer with handle. The stock began shaping the left side of a base in early June 2020, after recovering from a 49% plunge during the March coronavirus crash.


Over the next five months, it carved a shallow decline with an 18% correction from the June 2020 high to the bottom of the base **(1)**. The week ended Nov. 6, Blackstone stock began adding a handle, which drifted slightly lower over the next week **(2)**.


That set up a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 59.30, or 10 cents above the handle's high. Volume drifted lower along the handle. Volume was low at the late November breakout, when the investment management firm topped the buy point **(3).**


Volume didn't kick in for several weeks. Normally, there should be a spike in volume when shares top the buy point.


Yet, the saucer with handle base went on to yield big gains. Blackstone has rallied more than 140% since the November breakout.


That's why knowing how to spot bases on charts is crucial when learning how to invest.

A stock market allows investors to trade shares in public companies.


Most countries have [stock markets](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today/). In the U.S., the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq are the most important stock exchanges.


The NYSE was created by the Buttonwood Agreement, so-called because it was signed under a buttonwood tree, in 1792.


The Nasdaq, which comes from the acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation, was formed in 1971, first as an electronic bulletin board where offers to buy or sell small-company [stocks](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/592532-what-is-stock-own-piece-of-company.htm?ntt=new+york+stock+exchange), and later as a stock market, mostly in companies which didn't qualify for the major stock exchanges. In the early days, when a company grew large and important enough, it typically moved to another exchange.


But over time, many growth companies, such as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), stayed on the Nasdaq, earning it new prestige and the confidence of mainstream investors.


While the Nasdaq has always been an electronic market, linked by computer connections, the NYSE has traditionally traded stocks on a floor at 11 Wall Street in New York City.


Trading in each NYSE stock is conducted by a specialist on the floor, who has responsibility for maintaining an orderly flow of buy and sell orders.


As computers have taken over trading, specialists have become less important. Both stock markets now match buy and sell orders mostly electronically.


On the Nasdaq, trading is conducted by market makers. Market makers, like NYSE specialists, maintain an inventory of stocks and stand ready to [buy](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/598080-how-to-buy-stock-using-market-limit-buy-stop-orders.htm) and [sell](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/598330-how-to-sell-stock-using-market-limit-stop-orders.htm). A key difference is that each Nasdaq stock has numerous market makers, who compete for small, quick profits, which ideally translates into an efficient, liquid market.


In recent years, because of technological advances and regulatory reform, spreads between the bid and ask prices have greatly narrowed, depriving market makers of much profit, but making trading more efficient and cheaper for both institutional and individual investors. The bid is the price a market maker is willing to buy a stock from an investor. The ask is the price a market maker is willing sell a stock to an investor. The difference between the bid and ask is the spread, which represents the potential profit for a market maker.


To trade on a stock market, a company must be listed. Each stock market has listing requirements that include a minimum market capitalization (that is, the total value of outstanding stock shares), share price, profitability and corporate governance.


If a company falls below certain thresholds, it can be delisted from its exchange.


Today, the two top stock markets trade nearly 7,000 U.S. and foreign stocks. A foreign company can get listed on a U.S. exchange in the form of an American Depositary Receipt, or ADR.


To trade on a stock market, a company's stock must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the government body that regulates U.S. financial markets.


For most of its existence, the NYSE was run by members, whose number was fixed at 1,366. Someone could become a member by buying a seat from an existing member.


The membership system ended in 2005, when the exchange became a corporation with shareholders.


Similarly, the National Association of Securities Dealers divested from the Nasdaq in 2000 and 2001 and has become a corporation. Both corporations trade on their respective exchanges.

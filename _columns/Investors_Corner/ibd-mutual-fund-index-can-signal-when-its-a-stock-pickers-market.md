If you've ever wondered whether you're in a so-called "stock pickers' market," then you ought to get familiar with the IBD Mutual Fund Index.


Today, IBD has picked 19 leading and well-respected growth funds and tracked their performance to create this index, which you can see every day via a PDF attachment found at the bottom of IBD's daily **[Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/)** on the stock market.


So if you see the index outperforming broad market indexes like the S&P 500, then you know that active management -- stock pickers, in other words -- have the upper hand. They're beating out passive management, meaning funds that just track a broad market index.


In 2013, the S&P 500 rallied 29.6%, excluding dividends, while the Dow industrials lifted 26.5%. The IBD Mutual Fund index, composed of 20 funds at the time, rolled to a 34.2% gain. How about 2016? The 19-fund IBD Mutual Fund index, found at the bottom of the attached charts page, is up 1.8% year-to-date through Tuesday's close.


Why is it useful to know this? Well, if active managers are outperforming, then you might want to redouble your efforts in finding and buying leading stocks. You might want to weight your portfolio more toward stocks that you've selected.


The IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Your Weekly Review and Sector Leaders are some of IBD's proprietary stock screens that can help you find the best-performing companies with the highest probability of beating the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average. See this screen and others by going to the "Stock Lists" section of Investors.com.


On the other hand, if the IBD Mutual Fund Index is lagging all of the main averages, then you know you're probably not in a stock pickers' market. In this case, the index's performance indicates that stock pickers are having a hard time finding real winners. You might want to have more of your money in index funds or on the sidelines.


Of course, if the IBD Mutual Fund Index is underperforming but you're beating the market, then you've got an indication that you're really smart -- or just lucky and possibly heading for a comeuppance.


In any case, 2004 provides a nice example of a good year for stock pickers.


The major indexes performed well, as the NYSE composite led the way with a 12.2% gain.


The S&P 500 rose 9%, the Nasdaq 8.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average 3.2%. Meanwhile, the IBD Mutual Fund Index easily bested the performance of those three indexes, advancing 12.5% in 2004. And it even topped the NYSE's gain.


At that time, the index consisted of 23 leading growth funds picked by IBD.


The year 2011 wasn't a great year for stock pickers. The IBD Mutual Fund Index dropped about 4.5% in 2011, faring worse than most of the major indexes. The NYSE struggled even more, losing 6.1%. But the Dow rose 5.5%, the S&P 500 was flat for the year and the Nasdaq retreated just 1.8%.


Here's one other thing to keep in mind regarding this index: You could check it out periodically for classic chart patterns.


William J. O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has said he's looked for bases in the index. "When I've seen a classic, well-formed cup-with-handle pattern in this index, preceded by a strong prior uptrend to the pattern, the index and the market have almost always moved up," he wrote in his best-seller "How to Make Money in Stocks."


It's similar to looking for chart patterns in the major averages.


Be careful, however, about putting too much weight in a breakout by the IBD Mutual Fund Index or a major average. While it's certainly encouraging to see a breakout from a pattern, it's better to rely on follow-through days as a buy signal.

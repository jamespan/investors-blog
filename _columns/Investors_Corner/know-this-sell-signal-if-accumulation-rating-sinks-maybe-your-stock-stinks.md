Things are bad enough when you see your stock falling unusually hard. But you know you're knee-deep in something awful when those declines appear with signs that the big-money funds are driving those losses.




Knowing when to sell stocks means putting your finger on the pulse of institutional activity.


So, how can IBD help in this regard?


To make sure you aren't playing against the biggest pockets in town, monitor the Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Quickly check it for virtually any stock by getting a stock quote on the home page of Investors.com. Or go to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/); there, you can compare a stock's Accumulation grade with those in its peer industry group.

The Accumulation Rating runs from a best-possible A to a worst-possible E. It analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading.


No doubt, your biggest winners sported an A or B rating right when you bought the stock at a [sound breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). But owning the stock and watching it rise is no excuse to take your eye off the ball. A declining Accumulation/Distribution Rating would be a clue that the big guys are bailing out.


When To Sell Stocks: One Value Of This IBD Rating
-------------------------------------------------


This proprietary grade is best used to filter the market for great stocks to buy. Yet it can also serve as a relatively late sell signal to lock in profits.


Sometimes, a deteriorating Accumulation Rating presages other problems. Usually, though, by the time the rating falls apart — say, to a D or an E — the stock is already having problems![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IC_pot_071817-300x159.png). In what way? Maybe it has already sliced below the 10-week moving average. Maybe there's lots of volume on the downside.


Remember: You don't ever want to see a gain turn into a loss. A complete round trip of healthy gains can sap your confidence.


Look at fertilizer maker Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, a rip-roaring star from 2003 through 2008.  In January 2018, Potash merged with Agrium to form **Nutrien** ([NTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTR)), one of the biggest companies in IBD's [agricultural chemicals industry group](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-aug-06-2019/).


Steep gains and clear entries make for the sort of stock you could get your claws into. One of Potash's last bases before it peaked was a [square box](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-why-the-flat-base-square-box-show-bullish-action/) that broke out in the week ended April 13, 2007 **(1)**.


With many tests of the 10-week line along the way, Potash tore ahead to peak at 241.62 in June 2008 **(2)**, a staggering 328% past the square box's 56.45 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


From Giddy To Gloomy
--------------------


You're positively giddy. But a daily chart showed that in June 2008, the stock scored several new highs in below-average volume, a big no-no after a big run-up.  The stock started to back off. No need to panic. It's been lurching higher and backing off for years. But a closer look reveals that the Accumulation Rating had sunk to C+. Even worse, it had fallen as low as D+ a few days earlier.  The big funds were exiting. Potash was in trouble.


The stock rebounded off the 10-week line in July with solid volume. It moved up some. Maybe you feel better. But Potash sliced decisively below the 10-week line on July 23 **(3)**, with the Accumulation/Distribution Rating down to D-. Now you also see a head-and-shoulders top emerging and surging downside volume.


Hesitant to unload? Now there are no excuses. The stock is falling, and now you know what the big guys are doing — selling.



Nutrien currently holds 612 million shares outstanding and a market value of \$33 billion. It continues to trade sharply below its split-adjusted June 2008 peak of 201.


The stock is now trying to complete a [saucer base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/).

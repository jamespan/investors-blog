October 1990 was a scary time for investors, and for that matter, the United States. Would you have had the courage to buy stocks? If so, you could have been handsomely rewarded. A great rally awaited you.

So when a market decline has gotten quite deep, ignore the news headlines. Don't let fear overtake your portfolio just as a market is showing signs of a new bull run in the works.

How do you conquer fear? Focus on the day-to-day action of the stock market. The [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) and Market Pulse features, today on B8, will help.

At the bottom, the news will be terrible. It will look as though the market, the economy and the political situation will only get worse. Yet the savvy investor doesn't let fear dictate his or her actions.

The right move? Watch for a follow-through day. It occurs when one of the major indexes is up at least 1.25% on at least the fourth day of an attempted rally. On that day, volume must rise vs. the day before.

Here's how events of 1990 and 1991 unfolded: On Aug. 2, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait, seizing its oil. President George H.W. Bush vowed to oust the Iraqis if they didn't withdraw. The U.S. was on the path to war. Oil surged to \$40 a barrel.

Americans were told that their untested soldiers were no match for the battle-hardened Iraqi army. That prediction turned out wrong. Economists said that we were headed for a recession. That prediction was right.

Between July 17 and Oct. 11, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 22%. It looked like the bottom was falling out. Waves of bad news cut several nascent rallies short.

Then, on Oct. 18, the fifth day of a new attempted rally, the Dow jumped 2.7% in volume greater than the day before. The next morning's IBD reported it as a follow-through day, a possible market turning point. As events unfolded, that October day marked the time to begin prospecting for new market winners. **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) broke out of a cup base Nov. 12 in above-average volume. From there until its ultimate high in January 1992, it gained 364%.

From an Oct. 12 low to an April 17, 1991, intermediate high, the Nasdaq rose 58%. In one stretch between Jan. 15 and March 7, it rallied 16 of 17 days. After a brief hiccup, it would rally more. There was much money to be made fast in growth stocks.

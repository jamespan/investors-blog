It's relatively easy to use IBD and find leading stocks that are forming bases. But it's a lot tougher for both the individual investor and the professional to find truly exceptional patterns.


Like many things in life, the details can separate great patterns from merely decent ones.


In 1996 and early 1997, **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) crafted great bases. Its details are worth study.


From a low point in July 1994, shares of the fast-growing discount broker more than tripled by late September of 1995. Afterward, the stock went into a correction phase and built a deep four-month cup-with-handle base. The drop within the base was 43%, more than the 30%-33% maximum decline that you'd like to see.


A breakout from that faulty cup with handle went nowhere. Schwab settled into what would become a long, mostly sideways consolidation. While a consolidation isn't as well defined as a cup-with-handle pattern or double bottom, you still want to look for key traits that make a sound base.


Schwab's consolidation, which spanned nearly eight months, had a number of positives. First, the base was a continuation of a first-stage base. The cup with handle that didn't get anywhere was the initial part.


The pattern had many up weeks in above-average volume **(1)**. Such action points to [accumulation](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/772798-institutional-buying-accumulation-in-a-base.htm) from big buyers such as hedge funds and mutual funds. In total, the number of up weeks in high turnover outnumbered the down weeks in big volume by an 8-5 margin.


Schwab's consolidation also had a number of [tight weekly closes](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/773041-tight-weekly-closes-quiet-trade-monster-base.htm), which showed supporting action from institutions. And there was a [shakeout week](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/611012-liquidity-services-had-big-shakeout-in-december.htm)Â  **(2)** that ended July 19. During that week, the stock broke below its recent lows, but it then reversed higher in strong turnover.


Schwab broke out in huge turnover during the week that ended Nov. 8 and rallied 55% in just 16 weeks. Along the way, it made light pullbacks to gain support at its 10-week moving average. Then Schwab formed another cup-with-handle base.


The 14-week pattern had a big upside-reversal week in the week that ended April 4, 1997. Volume was huge that week, confirming the bullish move**(3)**. Four weeks later, in the week that ended May 2, the stock surged nearly 16%.


Schwab broke out from the cup with handle in huge turnover during the week that ended May 30. Shares rallied 29% by July before forming another base.

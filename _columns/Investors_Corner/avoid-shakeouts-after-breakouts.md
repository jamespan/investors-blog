Life is full of second chances, and the stock market is no different.

  

There's always a sense of satisfaction when a breakout works. You watch a stock set up, knowing the pieces are in place for a successful breakout. Sure enough, the breakout works. In spades.

  

But it's not always that easy. Sometimes breakouts fail miserably. A stock clears a buy point, then falls 7%-8% below the buy point soon after. Following a key IBD sell rule designed to protect hard-earned capital, you cut losses short.

  

Sometimes, failed breakouts are explainable. Even if they're not, the first thing to keep in mind is that breakouts have the best chance of working in the early stages of a confirmed uptrend. That's the time when fresh institutional money is coming in from the sidelines.

  

Breakouts have gotten more challenging. We're not in the early stages of a new bull market. The market bottomed in March 2009. Of course, some pullbacks have occurred along the way, but none that sharply exceeded a 20% correction that generally defines a bear market.

  

Buying a breakout late in a bull market lowers the odds of success. If you're buying breakouts and they're consistently not working, selling pressure is likely building in the broad market that may be a little difficult to recognize.

  

Stocks tend to struggle when the distribution day count starts to get elevated.

  

The distribution day count is found in the Market Pulse graphic in The Big Picture column (today on B3). Distribution days get counted when the market is in a confirmed uptrend or the uptrend is under pressure.

  

If you buy a breakout when the distribution day count is elevated, the odds aren't in your favor for a successful breakout.

  

Knowing a stock's trading personality before you buy is also paramount. How volatile is it? Does it tend to trade quietly, keeping its intraday price swings on a tight leash, or is it prone to daily price swings of 3% to 4% or even more?

  

Volatile stocks can deliver huge gains, but it's easy to get shaken out of them, too.

  

**O'Reilly Automotive**'s ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) breakout in the summer of 2011 was short-lived.

  

It cleared a cup-with-handle base at 61.39 in June, but rallied only 8% past the buy point before turning tail. A weakening market was mostly to blame. At the time, IBD's market shifted from "Confirmed uptrend" to "Uptrend under pressure" as distribution days increased. Traders had to cut losses as O'Reilly fell 8% below the buy point about five weeks later.

  

O'Reilly bulls didn't have to wait long for a new buy point. The stock quickly found its footing and cleared a new buy point of 66.62 in September. From there, it rallied 60% over the next seven months.

  

**Alliance Data Systems** ([ADS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADS)) also suffered a shakeout after a breakout in heavy trade in late October 2011.

  

Alliance's rally faded in just two weeks. The breakout failed by Nov. 23 when it fell 8% below the 101.15 buy point. The market suffered a sharp slide Nov. 1. The Nasdaq fell 2.9%. The Nov. 2 IBD showed a new market outlook of "Uptrend on pressure." But a new breakout in January 2012 yielded nice gains as the market calmed down and the rally picked up steam.

"History repeats itself" is an aphorism we all learn as children. There's much truth to it in the stock market, but many novice investors don't believe it.


They can't bring themselves to concede that the seemingly random squiggles carved out by stocks on a chart are anything other than, well, random. Some scholar even wrote a booked entitled "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" that made that very point. In some circles, it's become the conventional wisdom.


But to the trained eye, these patterns do repeat themselves -- and with good reason. The stock market is governed by a set of two principles: supply and demand; and fear and greed. Both are based on human nature, and human nature doesn't change.


In a bear market, all stocks are taken down. Greed gives way to fear, and investors can't sell fast enough. But the smart money sees value in the best stocks and will begin accumulating shares, bidding these stocks up. So, when the market hits bottom, some of these stocks will have already built bases and are back near highs. They get ready to break out and rush to new highs, leading the way once a new bull market begins.


And these bases have certain characteristics that show up repeatedly in market cycle after market cycle. IBD's founder and Chairman William O'Neil studied these characteristics in model books of great stock market winners after every bull market going back to 1888. He did this because he knew he would see these bases with the same characteristics again.


Take two double-bottom bases from different eras: **Nokia** ([NOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOK)) in 1998 and **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) in 2014.


Both companies were in hot new industries and were growing exceptionally fast. Nokia made high-quality and easy-to-use cellphones (it later sold its phone operations to **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT))); Palo Alto protects networks from intrusion. Nokia broke out in the early part of the final, frantic advance of the dot-com era. Palo Alto came during a milder bull market, but during a period when business and government were growing increasingly concerned about data theft.![ICa_NOK_041416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ICa_NOK_041416-1024x655.jpg)


Nokia built its base over 12 weeks and corrected 36%. Palo Alto took 10 weeks to build a base that corrected 29%.


Even a casual observer can see the similarity in both charts. They carved out patterns resembling the letter W. In both cases, the second leg down undercut the first. That's a critical feature in a double bottom. The second leg serves as a final shakeout of weak holders. But it's still too early to buy.


Both bases had very bullish features at the bottom of both down legs. As seen in Nokia's daily chart, the stock reversed off lows and finished with gains for the day **(1)**. Ditto for Palo Alto **(2)**. Though not a requirement, it's a feature that would cause an investor to sit up straight. It indicates institutional investors have come in to support the stock.


After forming a double bottom, a stock breaks out when it rises above the high point of the middle peak by at least 10 cents. In Nokia's case, the volume was well above average. In Palo Alto's case, the volume was only average. An investor would prefer to see better volume, but in Palo Alto's case, the trade worked.


After breaking out, both stocks had pullbacks, but didn't undercut the buy points, before advancing to highly profitable gains.![ICb_panw_041416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ICb_panw_041416-1024x654.jpg)

  Buybacks Might Be Sign Of Caution, Not Confidence

Investing is like a jigsaw puzzle; nobody has all the pieces at any given moment.


IBD's research going back to the 1880s, though, readily identifies the most important pieces that need to be in place to buy a stock.


The chief pieces are those expressed in CAN SLIM â€” current and annual earnings, the new factor, supply and demand, leadership, institutional sponsorship and the market's direction.


Other pieces play a minor role.


Companies buying back shares is one of those smaller pieces.


It's usually a good sign when a company that meets CAN SLIM criteria is buying back its shares.


But if the company can't meet the top criteria, buybacks probably won't add up to much.


**Buybacks And Timing**


A study released early this year by Thomson Reuters found that companies are buying back their shares at levels not seen since before the financial crisis.


Corporate cash is at record levels.


The Thomson Reuters study, though, found that few companies repurchased shares in a timely enough fashion to see significant price appreciation in the 12 months after.


In a way, that shouldn't surprise anybody. The skills of executives pertain to running a company, which is a different gift than stock picking and market timing. Many companies don't even try to time their buybacks. They buy shares on a regular basis, regardless of the market's condition.


IBD's historical research didn't identify buybacks as one of the chief criteria in history's strongest stocks. There is no B in CAN SLIM.


Still, there can be benefits to buybacks.


Usually buybacks are a good sign, especially if a small or midsize company is buying back as much as 10% of its shares.


A buyback reduces a company's share count, thereby potentially boosting a company's earnings per share. (The company's net income will be divided by a smaller number of shares.)


In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD chairman and founder William J. O'Neil wrote that "Charles Tandy (who founded the Tandy computer company) once told me that when the market went into a correction, and his stock was down, he would go to the bank and borrow money to buy back his stock, then repay the loans after the market recovered. Of course, this was also when his company was reporting steady growth in earnings."


O'Neil adds, "I'm not sure that company buybacks when earnings are not growing are all that sound."


In normal markets, the buyback can imply that the company expects good times ahead.


Yet, these aren't exactly normal times, are they?


Uncertainty is high in the market, perhaps partly because of huge government debt in Europe and the U.S. and partly because of Washington policies that increase uncertainty for businesses. If a company can't accurately project tax levels, health care costs and regulatory costs, expansion becomes a riverboat gamble.


So, cash on the sidelines and increased buybacks now might be reflecting caution more than anything else.


In this climate, investors are best off focusing on the price and volume action of the indexes themselves. Breakouts and big price runs are fueled by heavy fund buying, not corporate share buybacks.

In the movie "All the President's Men," Deep Throat tells Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward to "follow the money" to solve the Watergate mystery. The same advice applies to investors seeking to master the technique of how to find the best growth stocks about to break out.

Winning stocks typically start rising in heavy volume before they move to new highs. The strong volume increases signal that mutual funds and other big funds are actively taking positions.

It usually takes such investors weeks or even months to accumulate the many thousands or even millions of shares they need to fill out their positions. This activity will be reflected in IBD's proprietary Accumulation-Distribution Rating, which analyzes a stock's price and volume trends over the prior 13 weeks.

A rating of "A" or "B" indicates that funds are buying, or "accumulating," the stock. A "C" rating is neutral, and a "D" or "E" indicates net selling, or "distribution."

Look at a stock's daily and weekly charts to see if the stock is rising in heavy volume. On breakout day, the volume should be more than 40% above average, indicating big fund buying. You can confirm this action against the Accumulation rating too.

The Accumulation-Distribution Rating appears in IBD's [daily stock research tables](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-august-5-2016/), atÂ [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) at Investors.com and in charts accompanying the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/).

## How To Find The Best Growth Stocks: As Easy As A to E

Use the A-D rating along with other tools before buying any stock. These include the stock's [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), which combines major IBD proprietary ratings into one, including the Accumulation rating, the [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/), and [Relative Strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/).

The table included with this story shows the Accumulation-Distribution Rating of stocks that traded near buy points back in February 2012. Their Composite and Relative Price Strength ratings are also provided, along with their percentage distance off their 52-week highs.

As always, make sure the overall market is in a confirmed uptrend and the stock is at a buy point in a properly formed base before jumping in.

Also, don't wait for the A-D Rating to fall to D or E before selling. Look at the stock's daily and weekly chart action before deciding whether to hold or sell. Pullbacks in below-average volume usually aren't a concern, but heavy-volume drops could mean that institutional investors are bailing out.

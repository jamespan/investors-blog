  Base-On-Base Offers Opportunity in New Bull Market

The base-on-base can be one of the most profitable formations.


This key chart pattern often occurs near the end of a bear market. A stock breaks out before the bear ends and is prevented from making the usual 20% to 30% advance because of the bear's downward pressure. Instead, the stock forms a new base just above the former one.


When the bear market ends, the effect is similar to a coiled metal spring that has been held down, then suddenly released. The stock, if it has good fundamentals and is a leader in its sector, explodes upward in heavy trading.


**A minor advance**


If the stock advances 20% or more from the first base, it's not a base-on-base. Instead, the second, higher base would be a later-stage base.


It's best if the bottom of the second base doesn't undercut the buy point of the first base. But sometimes it does because of the extreme downward pressure exerted by the market. So it is all right if the new base occupies the upper half of the prior base.


**Arch Coal** ([ACI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACI)) broke out of a base-on-base in February 2005.


The stock formed a 21-week cup-with-handle base from June 28, 2004, until Nov. 22, 2004, when it broke out.


The coal mining firm's base was fine with plenty of signs of institutional accumulation. And the breakout was fine. The stock rose 6% that day on volume that was 216% above average.


**Two breakouts**


But the trade didn't work. Over the next four days, the stock rose a mere 5%, then the breakout failed. The stock dropped as much as 16%. An investor who bought the stock would have been forced out by the rule that requires selling if a stock drops 8% below the buy point.


Over the next 10 weeks, it built a new cup-with-handle base and broke out Feb. 16 at 39.44 on volume 64% above average.


From there, the stock was ready to go. By early February 2006, it advanced 124%. During that time, it barely ducked under its 50-day moving average Feb. 9.


One final note about the base-on-base pattern: While many successful base-on-bases undercut the buy point of the first base, they should never undercut the intraday low of the first base.


That would be a beast with another name. That would reset the base count.

Sometimes, you just have to bite the bullet and face the facts.

  

If your stock falls 7% or 8% from where you bought it, you have to cut it loose. This is the golden rule that should never be broken.

  

Not every trade you take is going to be a winner. The only sure thing is that you will have losses. That's why you need sound rules to follow when things go wrong.

  

A lot of investors don't like to take losses because they don't like admitting defeat. But in investing, feelings and emotions have to be set aside.

  

Anytime you're down 8% or more from where you bought shares, just dump the shares and say "next." The reason is simple: The trade isn't going your way. You have to get out in order to avoid more pain.

  

Kenny Rogers had it right in his 1978 hit song, "The Gambler." He sang, "You've got to know when to hold'em, know when to fold them; know when to walk away, know when to run."

  

Investors have to take care of losses or else risk watching their account balance drop significantly. Catastrophic losses don't occur every day, but they do happen. Look at Enron in 2001 or WorldCom in 2003. Former highflier **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) went from \$75 to 79 cents in a little over a year.

  

No one likes to lose money. But in investing, you've always got to maintain a proper defense. So the next time a stock falls 8% or more from your buy point, don't fret, rationalize, turn off the monitor, wait for break-even or morph into a long-term investor.

  

Instead, just hit the sell button and move on. Be proud of having the discipline to follow the rules. You might have just prevented a disaster. If the stock sets up again, you can always buy it back.

  

Losses are more easy to manage when they're small. If you bought a stock at 100 and it falls 5% to 95, the stock must rally 5.3% to break even. But a 50% loss requires a stock to double to get back to even.

  

**Volterra Semiconductor** ([VLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VLTR)) cleared a 27.98 buy point from a cup with deep handle July 14 last year **1**. Volume surged to nearly double its average that day. ([Click here](/NewsAndAnalysis/PhotoPopup.aspx?path=WEBcor0210.jpg&docId=562596) for daily chart.)

  

At the time, the stock had solid IBD Ratings: Composite 99, Earnings Per Share 96, Relative Price Strength 92 and Accumulation/Distribution B. But on breakout day, the stock stalled and closed below the handle buy point. It triggered the 8% sell rule two days later.

  

The stock started a comeback. But on July 27, it tumbled as much as 19% intraday after the chipmaker gave a soft sales outlook **2**. Investors who didn't follow rules would have been down 20% at this point and 33% by August.

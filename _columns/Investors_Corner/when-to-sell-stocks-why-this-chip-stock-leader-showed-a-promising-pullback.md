Whether you've been reading IBD for 10 months or 10 years or even longer, you can always benefit from a simple chart-reading exercise. It will help you judge how a leading stock is acting.


So, what is this exercise? Take a weekly chart that shows the price and volume changes. [Charts on Investors.com](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) or MarketSmith, an [IBD premium stock charting and screening service](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF), make this mental workout easier: Up weeks and their corresponding volume bars are painted blue, down weeks in pinkish red.


As you analyze a leader that may be forming a base — or at least pausing for air after making a strong move — study how the stock's price changes from week to week, as well as how the volume changes.


If the stock is rising in price, ask yourself: Is volume rising too?


If yes, think this: "*Institutions are actively accumulating shares. That's good.*"


If the stock is falling, ask: "Is volume cooling off?"


If yes, think this: "*Selling pressure is low. Most of the institutions are not letting go of their shares. Also good.*"


Also pay attention to weekly volume with respect to its 10-week moving average. If you see numerous weekly price declines, but the volume bars stand underneath the moving-average line, think this: "*Aha. This is evidence that the deep pockets really don't want to sell their shares. Good*."


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IC_mlnx_111317.jpg)Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) was a big flameout in the fourth quarter of 2012. Yet its run-up earlier that year deserves a close analysis.


The data networking technology firm roared ahead by 49.5% in the week ended April 20, 2012 **(1)** on a superb quarterly report (EPS rose 113%, revenue 61%). That yanked the stock 64% past a 37.53 buy point.


Such a big move doesn't mean you quit watching and move on.


The next week, Mellanox fell 6% in heavy trade **(2)**, but it was much less than the prior week's huge volume. Conclusion? Reasonable pullback. Keep watching.


The next week, as it went down 3%, saw even lighter volume **(3)**. Good. Look at the two other weekly declines. Volume fell and was also well below average **(4)**.


The chance to get in? The week ended June 8, as Mellanox successfully closed above 60 for the first time in seven weeks **(5)**. Volume grew. The stock doubled in 14 weeks. A breakout from a [cup base](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) occurred in June, too. A pullback to the 10-week line gave one more buy opportunity **(6)**.


Mellanox eventually peaked at 120.05 with a new high in low volume, an early sell signal, on Sept. 6. Over the next few weeks, fund managers sold shares with abandon and Mellanox triggered additional sell signals, including a 9.19-point drop to 101.65 in heavy trading, its biggest single-point decline since the start of the run on Sept. 10.


Two weeks later on Sept. 25-26, Mellanox closed below the 50-day moving average in accelerating turnover, another [key sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). Today, Mellanox is trading near 48.

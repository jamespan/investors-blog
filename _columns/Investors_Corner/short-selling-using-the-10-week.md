The 50-day moving average can provide support for a rising stock. It can also serve as upside resistance for a declining stock. So just as the investor who is optimistic about a stock can use the chart tool to time new or follow-on share buys, a pessimistic investor can use the line as a place to sell a weakening market leader short.


When you have a long position in a stock and it's advancing, watch the 50-day moving average. Also, keep an eye on the 10-week line on a weekly chart.


When you're long, it's good to see shares pull back quietly to one of these support lines, then bounce higher with gusto. That's where you can safely add a few shares to an already profitable position.


The same thing can apply to a former market leader that's crashing, a situation useful for short sellers.


First, you need a stock that has made a big run. As a rule of thumb, focus on those that have gained 300% or more in price.


You want to make sure it has definitely topped and showing signs of heavy institutional selling, such as torpedoes ([see Thursday's column](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/788432-short-sale-buy-signals.htm?t=1452205800778&cachecheck=1)). The stock has probably been through [multiple bases](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/788166-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) and has failed to rise past a late-stage base.


**Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) began a staggering decline in late 2014. The Vermont-based coffee roaster and marketer of single-serve coffee brewers had made a huge advance, running from 17 to 158 from July 2012 to November 2014.


The stock's unraveling started Nov. 20, 2014, when the company reported a sharp slowdown in profit growth. The stock gapped down more than 7% in big volume (please see a daily chart) and soon lost support at its 10-week line  **(1)**.


That first break was not a safe time to take a short position.


Many stocks come back, even after taking a trip below 10-week support. Several rallies up to or near the 10-week moving average help form the right-shoulder portion of what became a five-month [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/787959-how-to-short-stocks.htm).


Just as the long investor waits for the bounce from support, the short investor waits for the break below resistance.


Keurig made at least three attempts to reclaim the 10-week moving average. Each time, it failed. In mid-January 2015, the stock failed to retake the 10-week line near 138 and began falling hard. Over the next couple of weeks, short sellers could now make their move.


In short selling, it is best to take profits when you have them and cover when a gain is 20% to 25%. Why? Growth stocks that head south still tend to be volatile.


Keurig's gain reached as much as 26% as the stock hit a low of 109.06 by early February. That was the time to cover the short and book the gain. Keurig soon retraced much of its loss, rallying nearly four weeks.


In May, ahead of another earnings report, the stock found resistance at its 10-week line and dropped. At the time, IBD Leaderboard's Cut List noted Keurig as a potential short sale candidate.


Another big payoff came in August when the stock dropped 30% on dismal quarterly results. A short seller with conviction could have held after the initial gap down.


In December, shares soared on news that Keurig will be taken private by Germany's JAB Holding in a \$13.9 billion deal  **(2)**.

When we talk about how to buy stocks, knowing how to appropriately size your position is critical. And, even more importantly, knowing how to manage that position over long periods of time is an invaluable skill.


You may hold a stock over a period of months or years and the size of that position in your portfolio may shrink or grow depending on the surrounding market conditions, as well as the stock's own performance.




There are various ways to determine an initial position size when you first [buy on a breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), based on your conviction in the stock or the market. Once you have that first batch of shares, you can add to it as the stock passes new bullish entries or [pulls back](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


Ultimately, position sizing is a personal decision, because everyone has different risk tolerance. It depends on several factors like your overall portfolio size, personal risk tolerance, your age and your economic standing.


How To Buy Stocks: Determining Position Size
--------------------------------------------


One way to approach this is by determining how much per trade you're willing to risk. 


Say you're willing to risk 1% of a \$100,000 portfolio per trade. That works out to a loss of \$1,000 per trade. Our [7%-8% loss rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) of has us cutting our losses when a given position loses 7% or 8%. 


So, to figure out the dollar size of a position where an 8% loss equates to \$1,000, we could divide \$1,000 by 0.08, and we get \$12,500. Therefore, the total amount invested in any stock at full position size would be \$12,500.


Another method of determining position size is by limiting any given position to 10% of your overall portfolio. Say you've decided the total number of stocks you want to own at any given time is 10. Then for a \$100,000 portfolio, a full position would be \$10,000. 


The total number of shares you can afford of a stock will depend on that individual stock's price. This way, you limit the total number of stocks in your portfolio to 10 max, at full position. 


Investors need to be flexible. We don't have to start a position at a full size. Perhaps overall market conditions are volatile, uncertain or we don't have total conviction in a particular stock. 


Maybe we just want to start a smaller position to test the waters. Starting a half or quarter sized position in this case makes sense. For a \$100,000 portfolio, that'd be \$5,000 for a half and \$2,500 for a quarter position. 


How To Buy Stocks At Add-On Entries
-----------------------------------


The add-on entry is another key aspect of how to buy stocks. 


After you buy from an initial buy point, the first chance to add shares is typically a bounce off the 10-week line. These add-on entries tend to work consistently in stocks that are showing institutional support.


Perhaps one of your positions really starts to take off, and you get another chance to add after it's had a nice move higher. Say a stock had a move from 25 to 40, then pulls back to 35. 


From here, the stock tests support and bounces from its 10-week line and starts off again on a second rally. You could consider adding to your position, going from 10% of your portfolio and adding another 2.5% or 5% to compound your gains as the stock resumes its advance. 


This is an example of how adding to a core position can help you amplify your gains, by buying into strength and investing more in the stocks that are working for you. 


Selling Into Strength
---------------------


Another path you could take is selling into strength. Perhaps you have a 10% position and as the stock hits various sell points like [the 20% profit target](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/), or becomes 10% extended from the 10-day moving average, you sell in quarters or thirds, taking some profits as you go. 


Then, once the stock forms [a new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/), you can add back shares and ride the next rally.


It's smart to take at least some of your profits when the stock appears to be getting extended. Perhaps it gets 10% above its 10-day line, or even the 21-day line. This may be a sign it's about to pull back or trade sideways to digest gains.


We don't want to sell a stock entirely unless it's showing definite signs of trouble. Once you lose it from your portfolio, it's very easy to miss the next run.

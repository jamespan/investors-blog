When Mike Hicks began investing in the stock market almost 30 years ago, he practically gave up on analyzing the market itself.



"I was so confused by trying to interpret the market decades ago that I almost gave up trying and just focused on individual stocks, which was completely wrong," the retired CPA told IBD.

"There was so much conflicting information out there, even for a certified public accountant, for an educated person," Hicks said. "If you were trying to understand the 'experts,' one says 'A' and another says the opposite of 'A.' So you came away pretty much frustrated in that exercise, feeling that nobody can call the market."

That attitude turned 180 degrees when a friend showed Hicks a copy of IBD in the 1980s. The newspaper was launched as a daily in April 1984.

"I was absolutely amazed that I almost had to sit in a chair," he said. "This was what I was looking for all my life."

Hicks savored the screens of stocks that showed a rare combination of traits: strong volume demand and stellar fundamentals.

"It was like heaven," he said. "Now I could rely on the financial statement information, but I had the timing of how to read the chart and the backdrop of the all-important market status. So when you stack these advantages into your probability (of finding a winner), you start having markedly better success on a more consistent basis."

The "Ask Bill" series -- a former Investors.com feature that gave concise answers to questions submitted by readers about the stock market -- also energized Hicks. He says he printed out nearly every answer and stored them in a file for frequent reference.

Hicks is not only a longtime IBD reader, but also a host of the St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Fla., Meetup group, one of the best-attended IBD Meetups in the U.S. ([To find a Meetup](http://education.investors.com/meetup/) in your area, hover the mouse over "How to Invest" in the main navigation bar at Investors.com, then click on "IBD Meetups.")

At a past gathering, 53 people showed up, a monthly record and all the more impressive considering that snowbirds from the Northeast had already headed back up the coast.

## **'Please, No Rubber Carrots'**

The group, started in October 2003, had a humble start. It had no whiteboard on which to diagram the winning patterns that great stocks form before breaking out. No computer. No internet connection either. They examined charts with transparencies, a grease pen and an overhead projector.

Now, Hicks and fellow staffers charge \$26 a ticket. In return, the attendee gets a two-entree dinner with salad, bread, coffee and dessert, a batch of charts and other information, and several hours of education and guidance from veteran IBD readers on how to follow the market, how to build a watch list and how to use charts.

"The problem all the Meetups will face is the room charge. You can handle the meal costs, because you're giving people the value of the meal, although they do complain about the quality of the food regularly," Hicks said with a laugh.

"But I always tell them, 'Look, we're getting the room for such a discount because we're buying the meal, just pretend the meal is free.' I've been acting as assistant chef and telling them what vegetables were good to prepare from (the) frozen (stage). My line to the catering manager is, 'Look, please do not give us rubber carrots.' "

By adding a small override to the attendance fee, Hicks was able to raise enough funds to buy a digital projector and whiteboard to enhance the learning experience. He also gives a welcome package with 64 pages of material -- mostly [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/) articles -- to new members.

"We had borrowed a number of techniques from the (Meetup) folks in Chicago," he said.

## **A Golden Goose**

Hicks says a turning point in his investing life came in 2003. In the years preceding that, an 80-hour workweek and a string of personal tragedies made it hard for him to concentrate on the stock market.

"In May 2003, I knew that IBD is a golden goose, so I decided that either I had to study it, like a CPA, or I had to discredit it and become a mutual fund investor," he said.

After the grueling tax-return season, he spent a weekend that month going through the educational features on Investors.com.

That's when he discovered "Ask Bill." He learned so much from each nugget of information that he locked himself in his study from Friday night to Sunday night, asking his wife to leave meals outside the door. His computer printer ran all day, all night.

"It was an epiphany. I didn't know how the printer did not burn out," he said.

GPS device leader **Garmin** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)) was his first CAN SLIM stock, which he bought right at the breakout from a proper cup with handle in December 2002, two months after the major indexes bottomed. Hicks sold the stock for a 66% gain in less than six months.

He scored a bunch of winners that year, nailing down gains of 30% to 60% each.

Then came his all-time portfolio champ, stun gun maker **Taser International** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)).

**IBD:** You scored a 100% gain the first time you bought Taser in 2003. Why did you buy it again?

**Hicks:** I was sorry I sold it the first time. I was looking at a proper new entry point, and I saw that narrow opportunity in mid-December **(1)**. It did not quite meet all the criteria, but you could just kind of tell (it was setting up for a new breakout). The way it acted reminded me of the Nicolas Darvas book, "How I Made \$2,000,000 in the Stock Market." You could almost see that stock crouching like a dancer crouching before he jumped.

When I saw that settle down over the holiday season in December, I took a pretty significant position, and then I pyramided that position up in January. Then I just sat tight.

I could not believe my eyes as the tens of thousands (of profits in dollars) rolled up. All my friends, of course, and my family, and wife said to me, 'Are you going to hold it until you lose it all?' It just kept going up and up, and I kept sitting with my lips pursed.

It was just so strong, and the story was so profound; that weapon was saving lives.

But by April of 2004, the day I sold was a Monday. Obviously I knew the quarterly earnings would be released at 4:05 p.m. (Eastern time) that day. It had all the signs of a climax top. I said to myself, the expectations on this stock have to be so incredibly high at this point, I don't think even Taser could meet them. So I picked up the phone, called my broker and told her to sell everything. It is the first, and probably last, time that I sold a stock right at the top." (Hicks achieved a 285% gain on the position.)

**IBD:** Which features in IBD do you discuss regularly at the Meetup?

**Hicks:** What I use for the printouts every month for the Meetup is [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). It does a number of things, especially for new people, but I also use it personally to interpret the market for me, even after all these years.

Not only does it explain the market, but it gives you every day a list of the leading stocks that were up or down in big volume. So you can use that every day to identify those quality stocks according to [CAN SLIM principles](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735730). And the text usually discusses some of those stocks.

I think a lot of people do not recognize the immense value of what they're looking at on that page. I'm not aware of any other publication that puts on the front page a market call every day and tells you to the exact day that a new rally starts. And they call the exact day that they think it stops. I think that's an incredible thing to put on the front page of a major financial publication.

**IBD:** Do you encounter some attendees who mix the rules of CAN SLIM with other systems or their own?

**Hicks:** Yes, we've had quite a few, actually. I try not to give my opinion but Bill O'Neil's opinion, and what he advocates in all his materials. Bill has studied all these methodologies as well as charting methodologies like candlesticks, for example ... and he's not apologetic to say matter-of-factly that he's looked at these and invalidated them, and that none of these are superior to a simple price and volume chart.

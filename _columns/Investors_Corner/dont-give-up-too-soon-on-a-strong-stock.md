  Top Stocks Often Give Investors A Second Chance

Buying a top-rated stock precisely at the breakout only to watch it sink can be a gut-wrenching experience. After getting stung, a trader may vow to shun the stock — or the entire market — for good.


But it's important to always keep your emotions in check, as many leading stocks come back to have success on the second or even third breakout attempt.


Ask yourself how much conviction you have in a stock that has just shaken you out. Would you buy back if it retook its buy point in strong volume? If yes, then swallow your pride. The decision may be profitable medicine.


Let's say you bought **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) as it cleared a 108.59 cup-with-handle buy point in late September 2007 in strong volume. A few days later on Sept. 27, the stock whipped lower in huge volume **(1)**. Although First Solar did not trigger a sell rule, the wild day might have shaken you out.


Sometimes, an analyst downgrade, bad news about the industry, or just general market turmoil can trigger a temporary decline in even the strongest stocks.


Yet First Solar's breakout was accompanied by a confirmed uptrend. The stock had the fundamental and technical characteristics of a market leader, including a 91 Composite Rating and a best-possible 99 Relative Price Strength Rating.


Though First Solar's earnings growth had been spotty, sales growth was solid. The profit outlook for the final three months of 2007 called for 200% growth, according to a Sept. 28 IBD article.


The cup base was 39% deep from intraday high to low, a bit more than you'd like to see. In good cup patterns, the decline is typically limited to 33%. Plus, the left side of the base showed some wide-and-loose action marked by high-volume declines. But trading tightened up and volume picked up as the stock climbed the right side of the pattern and approached its buy point.


Those who still had confidence in First Solar would have had a second chance to jump back in on Sept. 28 — one day after that big shakeout. The stock resumed its rally and moved quickly past the 108.59 entry **(2)**. Given how deep the base was, one could have bought or added shares as it surpassed the cup's left-side high of 123.21 **(3)**. From there, First Solar ran up 160% by Dec. 27.


Not every stock you buy will be a winner on the first go. Be prepared to buy a stock a second or third time. This is impossible to do, unless you always hang your ego at the door.

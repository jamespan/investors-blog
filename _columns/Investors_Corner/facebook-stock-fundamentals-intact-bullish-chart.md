It's time to give Facebook's stock some credit.




After a data privacy scandal knocked shares of **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) for a loop in March, it's recovered in spades — so much so that on Thursday the stock made a breakout from a first-stage base.


Facebook's chart is compelling. It recently cleared a double-bottom entry of 186.20, but the breakout was in light volume. Facebook recently added a handle area to its base, presenting an alternate entry of 188.42.



It's not often that a former leader hit hard by institutional selling is able to come back, especially after a lengthy price run. Shares of Facebook hit an intraday high of 195.32 on Feb. 1, good for a gain of more than 400% since its May 2012 debut at 38. It closed at 38.23 on its first day of trading.


So far, Facebook stock is proving its mettle.


Facebook Stock Easy To Hold After 2017 Breakout
-----------------------------------------------


Even better, Facebook's price performance since a breakout from a base in late January 2017 offers a great illustration of why IBD rules for buying and selling are always prudent to follow.

The base breakout in early 2017 wasn't perfect but still worked well and ended up being a perfect entry point.


It cleared a first-stage [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) during the week ended Jan. 27 in higher volume **(1)**. The buy point at the time was 129.37. The breakout reinforced a steadfast IBD rule that says to buy stocks breaking out of bases when the [market is in a confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/). That was the case at the time.


Resets Base Count
-----------------


The base was first stage because the low of the base undercut the low of a flat base that formed a couple of months earlier. That served to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/). The thinking behind a base reset is that enough sellers get shaken out of the stock to pave the way for more upside.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ICfb060418.jpg)But Facebook showed less-than-ideal price action the very next week when shares reversed lower in higher weekly volume. It was a sign of institutional selling — not good to see so soon after a breakout. But no sell signal was triggered as the stock held above the buy point and its [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/).


Over the next several months, Facebook rode its 10-week moving average (drawn in red in the accompanying chart) higher **(2)**. It didn't take long for the stock to trigger an [IBD profit-taking rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) that says to take a 20% to 25% gain in a stock if you have it. Why? Because that's typically the time a stock starts to pull back and consolidate gains after a breakout.


Two Flat Bases Yield Mild Breakouts
-----------------------------------


In early August, Facebook started to take a breather but didn't correct much off highs. A [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/) eventually formed with a 175.59 buy point **(3)**, but Facebook had a hard time breaking out. It rallied 4.9% before settling into a [new flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with a 184.35 entry. It rallied nearly 6% from the second breakout before settling into its current pattern.


Big sellers were in Facebook in the week ended Feb. 9. Shares plunged 7.5% in higher volume, giving up support at the 10-week moving average. It rallied for a bit before plunging again during the week end Mar. 23. That was around the time of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.


But it didn't take long for Facebook to recover as Wall Street placed bets that the company would live to see another day without a meaningful hit to earnings and sales.


Shares of Facebook gapped up April 26 on bullish Q1 earnings. Investors were also cheered by a boost in daily user growth to 1.45 billion.

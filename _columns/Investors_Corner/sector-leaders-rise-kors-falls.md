As stocks rebounded Wednesday in the lightest volume of the year for the Nasdaq, sector leaders rose with one exception.


Upscale apparel provider **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) was the only stock among 15 sector leaders that fell.


The midcap stock trimmed 0.71, or 1.5%, to 46.10 in volume that was 16% faster than usual. On Tuesday, Kors fell almost 4% in 37% quicker turnover.


The action isn't as bad as it might seem at first glance. The two down days in above-average volume can't compare to the big trade this stock has shown on up days.


Volume for each of the three previous up days dwarfed trade on the down days. A retreat in declining volume is what bulls want to see.


For shareholders, the recent action didn't trigger any sell signals. But for investors looking to open a position, frustration lingers. Michael Kors is nowhere near a traditional buy area. It remains 36% above its 50-day line.


The 50-day moving average, though, will naturally rise as the early days of the IPO fall off the count. Combine that with a possible pullback or even possible sideways action in the weeks ahead, and Kors might eventually offer a fresh entry at the 50-day line, or even shape a new base.


Two sector leaders rose in heavy volume Wednesday.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) edged up 0.43 to 530.69 in 77% faster action. The stock fell more than 1% in afternoon trade before reversing higher.


The company unveiled a new, faster version of the iPad. Apple also announced that it was going to let users store movies on its iCloud storage service and said it was upgrading the Apple TV set-top box to handle the highest resolution.


Apple is 24% past a 427.85 buy point.


**Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) popped 11.86, or 2%, to 641.60 in 41% faster action. The company announced a private offering of \$875 million in convertible senior notes. Priceline said it will use net proceeds to buy back shares, which is generally regarded as bullish.


The online travel booker's stock is 17% past a 549.10 buy point.


Neither Priceline nor Apple has offered a new entry since their breakouts.

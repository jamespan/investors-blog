  Strong Annual Profit Growth A Hallmark Of Big Winners

Finding the best stocks out of the thousands on offer isn't easy, but screening for those with the strongest annual earnings growth is a good way to start.

  

Research by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil has shown that the biggest stock market winners over the past century have sustained strong profit growth for at least three years before beginning their big runs. That's why the "A" in IBD's CAN SLIM investment system stands for annual earnings.

  

Look for annual profits to grow at an average rate of at least 25% over three to five years. Often, the biggest winners show growth rates of 50%, 100% or more. Some winners that met that criteria in recent years include **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

  

"It's the combination of strong earnings in the last several quarters plus a record of solid growth in the recent years that creates a superb stock, or at least one with a higher probability of success during an uptrending general market," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

Pay special attention to the quality of earnings growth. Companies that show strong annual profit growth but anemic annual sales increases are likely cutting costs to keep profits high. Conversely, if sales growth is outpacing profit growth and margins are narrowing, the company's products may be facing tough competition or its costs are too high.

  

That's why strong annual revenue growth is also desirable. Companies that increase sales 25% or more annually, especially during periods of weak consumer demand, like now, are likely leaders in their industries.

  

Such companies typically create new or more competitive products or services than their rivals. Some create entirely new markets, such as Apple's iPods and iPhones.

  

Annual EPS can be found in mini charts throughout IBD, including the IBD 50 and Stock Spotlight. The data can also be found in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) at Investors.com. A high EPS Rating suggests that a company holds strong annual profit growth.

  

Some current IBD 50 stocks with top-notch annual earnings growth rates are shown in the accompanying table.

  

IBD research shows that leading stocks that staged big runs from 1980 to 2000 held median annual earnings growth of 36% at the start of their stock price moves. Three of four big winners also showed at least some increase in the rate of annual earnings growth for three years, in some cases for five years, at the beginning of their winning runs.

  

Pay attention to full-year earnings estimates, which point to possible up-and-coming growth companies. Of course, not all stocks that meet the A in CAN SLIM will turn into winners. And investors should wait for each stock to form a proper base and break out in strong volume before pushing the "buy" button.

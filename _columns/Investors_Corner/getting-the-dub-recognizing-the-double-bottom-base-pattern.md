Now that you have learned about the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-base-harbors-many-winners-before-big-price-runs/) and some other bases in Investor's Corner columns, it's time for the double bottom.

Though this pattern is not as common as the cup with handle, it still occurs quite frequently. It's been seen more often in the past few months, as the market tries to find a lasting bottom.

The depth and length of the double bottom are similar to those of the cup formation. However, instead of a smooth, rounded "U" shaped bottom, the double bottom creates a pointed "W" shape.

It is important for the second bottom to undercut the low of the first. If it does not, the weaker investors may not get shaken out, and you will be left with a more failure-prone "almost" double bottom formation.

The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of the double bottom is found by taking the top of the middle peak of the W, which should stop a little below the peak price of the pattern. As with other bases, volume should be at least 40% above average when the stock tops the buy point.

Double bottom patterns may also have [handles](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/), but this is not essential. If the double bottom does, then the peak price of the handle determines another buy point, which will often occur several weeks after the stock clears the middle peak.

## Case Study On Zscaler

**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IC_121321-300x161.jpg)Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) is a cloud-based information security company headquartered in San Jose, Calif. From April to September of 2020, the stock more than doubled in price, rising 146% until it topped out at 163.80 and began forming a double bottom.

Two weeks later, it dropped to its first bottom at 124 **(1)**, before rising five weeks later to 158.74 **(2)**. Roughly five points shy of the peak, this price determined our buy point. Three weeks later, the second bottom undercut the first at 120.34 **(3)**. This gave us 27% depth in our pattern, an acceptable decline. Double bottoms normally are no more than 33% or 35% in depth.

Having ticked the boxes for minimum length and maximum depth, Zscaler was poised to return to its buy point and take off.

After a strong earnings report, the pieces locked into place. On Dec. 3, 2020, Zscaler made a 26.5% move up from its 158.64 buy point **(4)**, reaching 189.65 in heavy volume. If you felt inclined to hold, 11 weeks later you could have made off with 45% profit when shares topped out at 230.88, pulling back and starting a new cup-with-handle base.

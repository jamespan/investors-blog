At its most basic level, a flagship [IBD sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/taking-profits/) to [take a 20% to 25% gain in a great stock](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) is straightforward.









 
 
 Decades of IBD research show that a stock tends to correct sharply in price once the gain from a base breakout reaches that threshold. That said, implementing the rule isn't always a slam dunk, especially when it comes to stocks showing signs they could be big leaders.
The bottom line: While it's a good idea to take a 20%-25% gain if you have it, take other factors into consideration. Is the market in the early stages of a new bull run, or the later stages? Are [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), or signs of institutional selling in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, too prominent to ignore? And how much conviction do you have in the stock?


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ICathm_020518-250x300.png)In 2017, hordes of highly rated stocks broke out, made gains of that magnitude, pulled back in very light fashion, then kept going higher.


**Autohome**'s ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) gain from a 67.79 entry recently hit 28%. A 20% gain came within three weeks after the Jan. 2 breakout, meaning the Chinese automobile online ad and marketing firm has potential to be an even bigger market leader. It's been an easy hold so far for those who bought the [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/) at the latest entry.


So, what's a good game plan from here? Well, one option is to take the gain and move on. Another strategy? Hold longer and wait for meaningful signs of heavy selling in the stock.


Short-term traders waiting for a convincing break by Autohome of the 10-day moving average got one Tuesday when shares fell 2.5% to 82.46. Selling right at the close would have produced a 21.6% profit. However, volume was just average and the stock closed near its session high.



 


The problem with waiting for a test of the 10-week moving average is that the support level corresponds close to Autohome's latest buy area. [Letting a stock erase a double-digit gain from a buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) isn't sound strategy.


Third option? Sell half the position for a profit, and give the other half more room to work.



After an Aug. 28, 2017, breakout over a 110.01 buy point, former [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) name **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)) quickly hit the 20% to 25% profit level. Some may have decided to take profits when the RV maker fell 4.7% in higher volume in the week ended Nov. 10, but it held above the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/).


The Nasdaq composite showed six [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), an elevated count, but many of them showed relatively mild percentage declines. Those who sat tight, waiting for a legitimate test of the 10-week line, were rewarded when Thor found support, then made new highs. By Nov. 29, Thor hit a high of 156.86, raising its gain to 42%. A defense-type sell signal flashed when shares slumped 10% in the week ended Jan. 26.

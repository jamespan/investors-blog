The top stocks were mixed Friday in mostly lower volume. **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)) continued to edge higher but **SodaStream** ([SODA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SODA)) fell for the third straight day.


FleetCor, which provides fuel cards to commercial vehicle fleets, climbed 29 cents to 52.74, just shy of the all-time high of 52.87 notched Nov. 27. The stock has risen steadily in recent weeks and has shaped a three-weeks-tight pattern with a potential buy point at 53.


SodaStream had been running quickly up the right side of a base before it reversed lower Wednesday and slid through the rest of the week. The maker of machines that turn ordinary water into flavored sodas lost 40 cents Friday to end at 39.60 in weak volume.


Yoga apparel retailer **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) was the biggest loser. It dropped 1.04 to 72.53 in volume that was almost double its daily average.


The drop came a day after Lululemon plunged below its 200-day line then reversed higher to end above its 50-day line, on better-than-expected Q3 earnings.


The former leader's fundamentals remain strong, with three-year profit and sales growth topping 40%. However, the stock is working on a late-stage pattern, which is prone to failure.


Fellow retail leader **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) also lost ground Friday, sinking 1.09 to 100.44 in weak turnover. It's also forming a late-stage base, a lopsided cup pattern.


Ulta, which sells cosmetics and other beauty products, is the top stock in the 14-member Retail-Specialty industry group. But the group was ranked 169th out of 197 as of Friday's IBD. Also, the retail sector was at No. 30 out of 33. The most successful stocks usually come from the top five or six sectors and the top 40 or so groups.


On the upside, **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) rose 1.07, or more than 2%, to 45.61. The stock retook its 44.90 cup-without-handle entry, but it's been volatile since the initial breakout failed. The first two rallies above the buy point were in mediocre volume, but on Nov. 26 trade was strong. Still, shares have not made much headway.


The remaining leaders ended little changed.

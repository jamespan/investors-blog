Virtually all beautiful diamonds are imperfect.




As a savvy growth investor, you should not expect all of your winning stocks to be perfect as well — at least in terms of corporate fundamentals and the chart pattern — before they make a sparkling breakout. But they should host many positive attributes. The more ways a stock meets the criteria in IBD's [CAN SLIM test for stock excellence](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), the higher probability that you'll make money.


So, when it comes to the [quality of a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), what composes beauty and strength?


Seek stocks that show [bullish price-and-volume action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) as the base forms. Expect higher volume on the up days and up weeks in price, lighter volume during declines. Symmetry and balance matter a great deal, too.

**Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) sparkled after crafting a [nine-week double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) from March to May. A [good double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) features two heavy sell-offs. The second low should undercut the first low. A middle peak between the sell-offs should occupy the upper half of the base itself.


How To Use Stock Charts: Positive Attributes In Roku Chart
----------------------------------------------------------



The correction within a double bottom should not be severe. Think along the lines of a well-formed [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/); most of the greatest stock market winners that formed this bullish pattern fell no more than 30% to 33% from the cup's high to low.


Did Roku pass all of these criteria? Sure did.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ICroku091619-300x161.jpg)The innovator in broadband-based video streaming technology peaked at 74.35 on March 11 **(1)**, then made two lows within its base. The second low of 55.02 **(2)** dove below the first low of 59.63.


The middle price peak within the base, 71.30, stood well above the 64.69 base's midpoint.


Online definitions of symmetry include "the quality of being made up of exactly similar parts facing each other or around an axis" and "correct or pleasing proportion of the parts of a thing."


Double Bottom Symmetry
----------------------


If the midpoint of Roku's double bottom serves as an axis, then the left and right sides of its base showed a high degree of symmetry. It took 17 trading days for the left side to form and 25 days for the right side. The weekly chart shows four weeks' of time on the left half, four weeks after the middle peak on the right half.


On May 28, Roku vaulted 28% to 83.17 on [Q1 results and higher guidance](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q1-2019-roku-stock/). It cleared the 71.40 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in the heaviest turnover in more than a year **(3)**.


Most big stock market winners show big gains in profits and sales before [the breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Roku has yet to produce an annual profit. But the Street is rewarding the company's sterling revenue growth. Through Q2 of this year, the top line has lifted 40%, 28%, 36%, 57%, 39%, 46%, 51% and 59% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.


Roku And The Stock Market Today
-------------------------------


The stock has corrected sharply since peaking at 176.55 on Sept. 9 and is trying to bottom out near 100. Watch for a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) to potentially form.

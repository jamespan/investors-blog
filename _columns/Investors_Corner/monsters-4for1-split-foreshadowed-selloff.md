Pssst. I have a two-for-one deal that you absolutely can't refuse.

  

I'll give you two stocks for every one you own — a 2-for-1 split.

  

I have to cut the price of the shares I give you in half. So if you own a share worth \$100, you get two shares worth \$50 each. After all, we can't just arbitrarily double the company's market value.

  

Here's the deal. The lower share price allows more investors to buy. That will boost the stock price — and the value of your shares. How about it?

  

Well, you say, let's take a closer look. You in fact might decide that it's actually time to sell your shares and nail your gains.

  

IBD research shows that one stock split will usually be OK during the early stages of a bull market. But two or more splits during a short period of time — say, within a year or two — may actually signal that the stock has peaked.

  

Too many stock splits create a flood of supply, which can weigh on share prices if the company has overestimated demand. It's especially true of stocks that have had long, sharp advances near the tail end of a bull market.

  

Firms that split their shares in a big way, such 3-for-1 or 4-for-1, are especially vulnerable.

  

Hansen's Natural, now **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)), plunged from record high levels shortly after its 4-for-1 split took effect in the week that ended July 14, 2006. The split came only 11 months after an earlier 2-for-1 split in August 2005 and coincided with the market falling into a correction.

  

Monster, which had hit a high of 52.72 in the week ended July 7, lost more than half its value in just four months.

  

At the time, Monster boasted best-possible 99 Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings. But stocks' charts often give off sell signals well before their sales growth and profit growth fade.

  

A stock split is one of many signals that the stock's run may have peaked. According to IBD research, 82% of the stock market's biggest winners didn't split their stocks in the year preceding their biggest price advances.

  

So shareholders should start looking for sell signals when a company announces that it's splitting its stock. The signals could include a failed breakout from a late-stage base, as Monster had in early August 2006 **(1)**. Monster also plunged below its 10-week moving average in huge trade, another sell signal **(2)**.

  

Also, if you see repeated new highs in low volume or big downside reversals in heavy trade, it's time to let your shares go and say, "Let's split."

If a stock is nearing a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), and you want it badly, why not just go ahead and buy it? After all, if it's going up, why not hop on board early?

That's often a big mistake that investors make with growth stocks, a key violation of basic investor discipline.

Growth stocks can create what seem to be [perfect bases](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) and then, as they approach the [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), become nearly irresistible to those who want to get ahead of the game.

But the breakout rules are not random. They exist because extensive computerized analysis by IBD of the greatest stock market winners in history has shown that you should buy a stock _after_ it [breaks above a buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), not before. And deciding what the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) should be is anything but random.

Take **Canada Goose** ([GOOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOS)). It cleared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a third stage [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) in November 2018 **(1)**. But it didn't take off. Instead, it corrected and began to form a deep [cup base that initially showed no handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/).

Nothing wrong with correcting. But the price action was sloppy.

On a weekly basis, GOOS swung as much as 10% or more from weekly low to weekly high. You want to see [tight price action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/winning-stocks-show-tight-closing-prices/) because that usually means big holders are holding, or buying, not selling.

And even when the stock hit a record high of 72.27, the stock quickly nose-dived. So did the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). For savvy investors, that was a big tell. It said that the stock, despite rising to a new high, was getting weak fast.

After hitting its high, GOOS closed lower for six straight weeks, reaching a low of 40.19. That's a precipitous 44.4% drop. It's too deep to form a proper [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), which should generally never fall more than 30% to 33% from the lip of the cup to the bottom.

Finally, in the second week of February, Canada Goose stock began building the right side of that too-deep cup base. But it didn't quite finish. Instead, it shaped a [flawed handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-what-does-a-flawed-handle-look-like/) **(2)** on the right side of the cup, revealing a 60.04 buy point. But the stock didn't break out. It went sideways in sloppy, loose price action, then stumbled and fell.

The coup de grace came on May 29, after GOOS reported flat fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. The stock all but collapsed, plunging 30.9% in one frantic day **(3)**. It hit an intraday low of 31.67 just five days later. While the stock eventually climbed back to as high as 47.92, it now trades near 37.

What went wrong? GOOS stock had outstanding ratings. But those who bought it off its shaky exit from the double bottom in late 2018 — or before it broke out of its cup with handle earlier this year — paid a bitter price. The stock fell sharply both times. The important thing is never buy a stock out of a faulty base, whether it's a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/), a [flat base](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) or [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/).

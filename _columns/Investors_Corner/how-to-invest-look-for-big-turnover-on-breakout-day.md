  How To Invest: Look For Big Turnover On Breakout Day

It’s repeated again and again in IBD articles: You should demand strong volume when a stock breaks out to new highs.


Look for heavy turnover intraday as the issue clears its buy point, but also make sure trade stays elevated through the market’s close.


Many stocks break out in strong volume in morning action, yet turnover fizzles by day’s end.


Sure, some of those breakouts will work out and provide solid gains. Still, it’s important to remember the ideal situation is fast trade throughout the breakout session.


Daily volume ought to come in at least 40% above its daily average over the past 50 sessions as a stock clears a buy point from an area of price consolidation. You even could see much heavier action.


“During major breakouts, it’s not uncommon for new market leaders to show volume spikes 200%, 500% or 1,000% greater than the average daily volume,” wrote William J. O’Neil, IBD’s founder and chairman, in his book “How to Make Money in Stocks.”


Don’t think that you’re unlikely to see the ideal situation. Yes, with some mega-caps, it’s tough for even big investors to move the needle when it comes to daily volume.


But in fact, breakouts often draw convincing turnover all day.


**Joy Global**‘s ([JOY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JOY)) behavior in late 2003 provides a good example of a stock attracting massive turnover throughout its breakout session.


The manufacturer of mining equipment cleared a 17.40 buy point from a square-box base on Oct. 1, 2003 **(1)**. Daily turnover was certainly convincing — coming in 562% above average **(2)**. It was the highest volume in at least a year.


Ahead of its breakout, Joy Global had earned mostly respectable IBD ratings. It sported a 74 Composite Rating, 81 for EPS, 70 for Relative Strength and B- for Accumulation/Distribution, but also a weak E for its SMR Rating.


After this October 2003 breakout, the stock — which used to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol JOYG — ended up making a monster multiyear advance that ran through April 2006.


So where can you keep track of daily turnover? Investors.com is a good place to see intraday volume for any stock. You can look up a stock and check out how its trade is coming in vs. the issue’s average turnover in the past 50 sessions. The comparison is prorated, meaning on a same-time-of-day basis.

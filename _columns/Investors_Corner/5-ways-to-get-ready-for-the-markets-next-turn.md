 If an individual investor is to win consistently in the stock market, he or she must stay a step ahead of the game.
While investors should always heed current conditions, they also should have a Plan B ready for when the market turns. In the current confirmed uptrend, this means investors must know what they will do when the correction comes.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ICnsdq061217.png)The market hasn't had a correction of 10% or more since late 2015 to mid-February 2016, when the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 pulled back 18% and 14% respectively.


When the next pullback comes, here are five things to consider:


**No. 1: Be realistic.** Recognition that a pullback is underway will emerge as the correction unfolds. No one can pick the market's turn at its birth, but an investor can thin holdings as they show weakness.


**No. 2: Expect change.** Right now, chips and the mega caps have been the leaders. The leaders of one bull trend rarely repeat in the next uptrend. So, when a correction knocks stocks around, and then the market begins a new uptrend, don't expect the same leadership.


**No. 3: Look for resilience.** In "How to Make Money in Stocks" William J. O'Neil wrote, "In a correction during a bull, or upward-trending market, the growth stocks that decline the least (percentage-wise) are usually your best selections." So, when a correction comes, study the industry groups to see what is holding together best.


**No. 4: Watch for new highs.** "Once a general market decline is definitely over, the first stocks that bounce back to new price highs are almost always your authentic leaders," O'Neil wrote.


**No. 5: Scan the breakouts.** When a follow-through day confirms a new uptrend is underway, leaders sometimes break out on the follow-through day itself, or they emerge in the first few weeks.


Consider the 2010 pullback and rally. After a 20% run-up in the Nasdaq from February 2010 to late April 2010, the market started to correct. From early May through August, the Nasdaq pulled back in a choppy fashion.


Then on Sept. 1, Day 4 of the attempted rally, the Nasdaq flashed a follow-through sign **(1)** and **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) topped a 154.53 entry the same day. Chipotle's stock rose 70% in three months.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) cleared a 266.09 buy point in a double-bottom consolidation Sept. 13. Apple rose 37% in five months. **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) cleared a 43.47 buy point Sept. 14 in a double-bottom pattern. Lululemon's stock rose 96% in five months. China-based internet portal **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), cleared a 46.02 entry Sept. 15 and rose 107% in five months. China-based internet search engine **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) topped 88.42 on Sept. 20 and gained 30% in two months.

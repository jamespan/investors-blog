IBD wants people to save, invest and do well.

  

One way to do that is by using a Roth IRA.

  

This column will give a quick overview of this type of account — as well as some ideas on how different IBD features can help you with managing your Roth IRA.

  

But first of all, investors should know that a key deadline is approaching for Roth IRAs.

  

If you act by this year's tax filing deadline of April 17 (Tuesday), you can make a contribution that counts toward your limit for the 2011 tax year.

  

After Tuesday, any transfers to your Roth IRA will count toward your 2012 limit.

  

The government caps the amount that a taxpayer can contribute to \$5,000 a year. Starting at age 50, eligible taxpayers can put in an additional \$1,000 a year as a so-called catch-up contribution.

  

But remember there are income limits, as well as a way for high-income workers to get around the limits. They were detailed in a [Funds & Personal Finance article](http://news.investors.com/article/606898/201204051419/roth-ira-conversion-strategy-for-the-wealthy.htm) on Page A8 of IBD's April 9 edition.

  

Now that you know a deadline is approaching, you also ought to keep in mind some of the Roth IRA's attractive qualities.

  

You contribute after-tax money to the account, but it then grows tax-free.

  

You can withdraw your contribution at any time without a penalty. After five years and after reaching age 59-1/2, you can withdraw earnings without penalty.

  

In certain cases, earnings can be withdrawn after five years tax-free, even before the account holder hits 59-1/2.

  

Another advantage is that you have a wide range of options when it comes to investing. With a Roth IRA, you can invest in real estate, stocks, bonds, mutual funds and more.

  

Other retirement accounts are more restrictive.

  

With all of these advantages, it's no wonder the Roth IRA is gaining in popularity.

  

In recent weeks, there's even been a push dubbed the "Roth IRA Movement" — personal-finance bloggers and other writers urging people to learn about this type of account.

  

So what about using IBD once you've got a Roth IRA?

  

Here are some starting points that won't surprise longtime IBD readers but should help newbies.

  

You can look through IBD's Mutual Funds & ETFs section (today starting on Page A11) to get ideas about funds to invest in.

  

If you want to put your money in a relatively stable, dividend-paying stock, consider looking at the Big Cap 20 feature, which appears every Tuesday.

  

This feature highlights top-rated stocks with large market capitalizations. These stocks generally don't score the biggest gains, but they're less volatile.

  

Discount retailer **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), software maker **Intuit** ([INTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTU)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) are among the names that have made the Big Cap 20 lineup lately.

  

Other alternatives for dividend stocks are in the daily Income Investor column, today on Page B3.

  

More aggressive investors can look at the IBD 50, which appears on Mondays and lists stocks that are leading the market. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) are among the names recently featured in the IBD 50.

  

Roth IRAs can tend to be smaller accounts, but it just takes investing in one big winner to really increase your nest egg.

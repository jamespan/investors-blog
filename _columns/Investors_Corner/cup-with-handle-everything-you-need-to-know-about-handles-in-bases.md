One of the most famous chart patterns when trading stocks is the cup with handle. But how do you recognize when a cup is forming a handle? And once you do, where is the buy point?




A good cup with handle should truly look like the silhouette of a nicely formed tea cup. The cup should not look like a "V," but rather have a nicely formed cup base before the stock begins to rise along the rear wall of the cup.


After that, the handle alone needs at least five days to form. It should have a downward price drift or "shakeout" to allow uncommitted holders to leave the stock, making way for more committed buyers. This decline along the handle should take at least a week on a weekly chart, but it could go on for weeks.


The price drop in a proper handle should be within 12% of its peak. Make sure it doesn't exceed the cup portion in time or size of decline. The handle should also be above the stock's 10-week moving average.


Cup With Handle Is One Of Eight Base Patterns
---------------------------------------------


Of the eight principal base patterns — including the [ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/), [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/), [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/), [high](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-high-tight-flag-can-deliver-skyscraper-sized-gains/), [tight flag](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-high-tight-flag-can-deliver-skyscraper-sized-gains/), [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/) and [saucer](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/) — the cup with handle remains to this day one of the most successful. Double bottoms and saucers also can have handles, but they are less common.

The pool equipment supplier first began forming a cup in late February 2020, and its cup base lasted 62 days, taking the company though the Covid-19 outbreak. It hit a buy point of 229.98 that was derived from its handle. The handle had proper depth of 10% **(1)**, light volume **(2)**, and good length at about three weeks **(3)**.


After that, the stock went on a tear. The breakout on May 18 came in heavy volume and the stock climbed to a nearly 50% gain to a peak in August, 2020. Pool formed a cup without handle in September and reached another 342.25 buy point, then kept on going.


Pool Stock's Cup With Handle Set Up Buy Point
---------------------------------------------


Pool on Oct. 22 reported 39% higher third-quarter profit. That topped expectations by 23%. Pool is one of [IBD's Long-term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/). Last month, it was named second place on IBD's [Best ESG Stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/esg-companies-list-best-esg-stocks-environmental-social-governance-values/) list for its environmental, social and governance policies.


Remember, the handle usually begins with a down day in price, and can morph into a base of its own in certain cases. That's not a problem; it's often a stock's way of offering a buy point that's clearer or lower than that suggested by the larger pattern. During bear markets, some good cup-with-handle bases show a large decline within the handle. But again, it should not exceed the drop within the cup.


The handle should form in the upper part of the entire pattern. If it's too low, it's flawed.


Cup With Handle Can Be Flawed
-----------------------------


An [upward-sloping handle is flawed](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flawed-chart-patterns-why-a-wedging-handle-is-bad-news-for-investors/); it represents weak demand as new buyers move into the stock at a trickling pace. During the stock's actual breakout, you want to see a new wave of buyers coming in at a torrid pace, not a trickling one.


Also, a steep, high-volume decline should put you on alert. You don't want to buy a stock that institutional investors couldn't wait to unload at any price.


The cup should form smoothly, without major price declines on the left side. Sharp gains on the right side aren't necessarily good, either.


Volume should be light in the handle, too.


The Buy Point
-------------


The buy point from a cup-with-handle base appears at the highest point of the handle, plus 10 cents.


Also, when the stock is breaking out, you should generally see a rush in turnover. Volume should ideally rise at least 40% above its 50-day average. Big caps sometimes can break out successfully with smaller volume surges.


IBD founder William O'Neil often said at past IBD seminars that after a stock breaks out, he wants to see weekly volume rise vs. the prior week. This signifies a sudden shift in demand for shares that could continue to build up.

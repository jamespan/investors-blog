No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.


Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included **El Paso Electric** ([EE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EE)), **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)), **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) and **Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)).


The mention of those equities alone said, "It's a bear market."


As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.


What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.


The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by [CAN SLIM standards](http://education.investors.com/) .


The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?


Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.


Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.


Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.


What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?


The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.


The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.


Yet only two bank stocks made the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/top10/default.aspx) — **Bank of the Ozarks** ([OZRK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OZRK)) and **Signature Bank** ([SBNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBNY)). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

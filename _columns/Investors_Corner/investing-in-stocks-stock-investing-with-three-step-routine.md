Offering no shortage of lessons on how to invest, the new year has kicked off with a mix of vigor and volatility. While **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) sets up a fresh buy point and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) shows its strength and resilience in a challenging market, **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) takes a second hit after rocketing to a record high.


As the tech-heavy Nasdaq tests resistance around the 20,000 mark, [Magnificent Seven stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) have retreated below their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Meanwhile, despite pulling back this week, **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) continues to show resilience as it holds support at its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).




The mix of breakouts and breakdowns among leading growth stocks serve as reminders of why investors need rules for both [how to buy stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) and [when to sell stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/when-to-sell-stocks/). Start with a simple [three-step investing routine](#routine).

Risk Management — One Of Four Pillars Of IBD Methodology
--------------------------------------------------------


Volatile action in indexes and leading growth stocks reinforces the need for investors to have a strategy on how to invest amid [changing market trends](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-handle-changing-stock-market-trends/).


For example, choppiness within a bull market reminds investors to stay flexible and focused on [risk management](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/risk-management-in-the-stock-market-how-much-money-to-invest-now/).


Remember that one key to successful [stock investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors/) is to make sure you have a sound — and doable — routine for investing in stocks in good times and bad. Following this approach helps investors stay in sync with [The IBD Methodology](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/).


Each day, you can check IBD's [recommended market exposure level](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) to help determine how aggressive or defensive to be.

How To Invest Using Time-Tested Rules
-------------------------------------


Backed by time-tested [rules for when to buy, sell and hold](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-invest-rules-for-when-buy-and-sell-stocks-in-bull-and-bear-markets/), this three-step approach can help you navigate whatever the market indexes do. Depending on current market conditions, you'll see how these rules and this routine apply to stocks like Nvidia, Apple, Palantir and other leading growth stocks.


The same guidelines outlined in this routine can teach you how to invest in [IPOs to buy and watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ipo-stock-news-and-analysis-find-todays-top-new-issues/). So while tracking household names like Microsoft and Apple, use this same approach to monitor [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).


The routine below walks investors through three basic steps to help you grow and protect your money. And you'll find the [screening tools](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/) and [stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) you need to quickly and confidently follow those steps.


Investing in stocks based on sound rules and [stock ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/) will help you stay profitable, protected and prepared in any market environment.


Find And Track The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch
-----------------------------------------------


This three-step process also helps you track and handle strong market uptrends, as well as bear markets, choppy periods and times of [sector rotation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-sector-rotation/). This is vital in learning how to invest successfully.


Tesla, Google, Apple, Meta and Nvidia are just five examples of highly watched stocks that have gone through roller-coaster rides in recent years.


One key to gauging strength or weakness in the [stock market indexes](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-today-stock-market-news/?) and individual stocks is to see how they behave around their [50-day and 10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/). Are they finding support or hitting resistance?


Monitor Stock Charts
--------------------


Another key to stock investing is learning [how to read stock charts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/). While checking the general stock market trends, be sure to also track [chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/) in individual stocks as part of this routine. This helps you identify [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and [buy zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-gives-investors-chance-to-buy-top-stocks-beyond-breakout/) for potential and recent [breakout stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/breakout-stocks-technical-analysis/).


Watching such [technical analysis](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/) also helps you avoid getting swayed by any hype or hysteria in the headlines. This approach helps you stay grounded. It also helps keep your [investor psychology](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) in check and stay focused on what the market and leading growth stocks are actually doing.


Also, keep in mind that the stock market direction can change quickly — for better or worse. And there will be times when certain sectors, such as growth and [tech stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-and-watch/), perform poorly while others show strength.


To zero in on the best stocks to buy and watch that fit your investing criteria, use the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/) to browse preset lists or build your own custom screens.

To study these winners, take a look at the daily, weekly and monthly charts for these and other traditional growth stocks.

How To Invest: Three-Step Investing Routine
-------------------------------------------


1. Check Current Market Trends With The Big Picture And Market Pulse
--------------------------------------------------------------------


*Under the "Market Trend" tab on Investors.com, go to* [*The Big Picture*](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).


The first step in how to invest successfully is to know what kind of market we're in right now. Is it time to buy stocks, or is it time to play defense and protect your profits?


Find out by checking the [Market Pulse inside The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). You'll find the recommended [market exposure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) level to help manage your risk based on the current market environment.


This [five-tiered approach to market exposure](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends/#MarketExposure) ranges from 0%-20% in bear markets or corrections, all the way up to 80%-100% in robust bull markets.

2. Find The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch With IBD Stock Lists
-------------------------------------------------------------


*Under the 'Stock Lists' tab on Investors.com, go to [Stock Lists.](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/)*


[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GSP_IBD50.png)](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)The best-performing stocks typically display [seven common traits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/can-slim-stocks-how-to-find-stock-market-winners/) in the early stages of their big moves.


Using exclusive [stock ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-leaders-arent-hard-to-find-with-ibd-stock-checkup-tool/) and [stock lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) like the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders, you can quickly identify which stocks are most strongly showing those same characteristics right now.

**Which Top-Rated Stocks Are In Or Near A Buy Zone Right Now?**  

Simply scroll through IBD screens to find highlights of [top-rated stocks in or near a potential buy range](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/). It's a simple, effective and fast way to build your watchlist.


3. Evaluate Your Stocks And Plan Your Trades With Stock Checkup And IBD Charts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Under the "Research" tab on Investors.com, go to*: [*IBD Stock Checkup*](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) | *[IBD Charts](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=daily)*.


What's the most effective way to maximize your profits and minimize risk? Always check both the company's "fundamentals" (e.g. sales, earnings, products and industry trends) and "technicals" (e.g. price and volume action, support and resistance in the chart).


That *combination* gives you a major advantage over investors who only look at one or the other.


[![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GSP_checkup.jpg)](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/)**Does Your Stock Pass Or Fail?**

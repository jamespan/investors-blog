Learning [how to invest](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/getting-started/) in a roaring bull market is night and day compared to the current stock market correction. Savvy investors can spot the shifting market sentiment and adjust their investment strategies, saving their hard-earned capital for when gains are more easily captured.




When Will The Stock Market Correction End?
------------------------------------------


[Learning how to invest](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) during a weak stock market requires patience and discipline.


When the market grinds lower, investors should be on the lookout for a potential [follow through day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/). A follow-through occurs on the fourth day or later of a rally attempt. It signals a potential bottom and shifts the [market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) back into a confirmed uptrend.


The change in trend gives investors the green light to begin [buying stocks](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) again. But that doesn't mean the danger has passed.

How To Invest On The Follow-Through Day
---------------------------------------


On Sept. 1, 2010, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite signaled a trend change when it [followed through to the upside](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) with a 3% gain in volume that was heavier than the previous trading session. That one day arose after months of high market volatility. Recall that May 6, 2010, was known as the Flash Crash. On that day, the Nasdaq declined more than 9% at its lows before closing with "just" a 3.4% loss.


Psychologically, it can be difficult to start buying stocks after weeks and even months of extreme market volatility. With that in mind, investors should always try and buy something on the follow-through day. According to William J. O'Neil — founder of Investor's Business Daily and author of "How To Make Money in Stocks" — "It (the follow-through) just gives you the go ahead to begin buying high-quality stocks with strong sales and earnings as they break out of sound price bases..."


Don't Go All In At The Start
----------------------------


Don't be too aggressive and go all in immediately after a follow-through takes place. [Not all follow-throughs work](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/), so it's important to remain prudent and disciplined when buying stocks.


If the uptrend is real and lasting, there will be plenty of time to buy new breakouts and hold top growth stocks for extended moves.


The Follow-Through Day In 2010
------------------------------


Looking back to 2010, the Sept. 1 follow-through signaled it was the time to start buying stocks. On that day, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) broke out past a cup with handle's 154.53 buy point. The stock would go on to have a tremendous move, hitting 70% in just three months.


Less than two weeks later — on Sept. 9 — iPhone maker **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) broke out past a [double bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) with a 266.09 buy point. The stock rose more than 20% by November.


The Lululemon Breakout
----------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IClulu120518-300x169.jpg)Current [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investo) stock **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) broke out from a [solid double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) on Sept. 14, 2010. [That breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) required patience since the stock's move didn't gain any real traction until November.


But patient investors were rewarded when shares nearly doubled by February 2011.


Finally, Chinese web search engine and tech giant **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) [broke out above a flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) with an 88.42 entry on Sept. 20.


In seven trading sessions, it triggered the [eight-week hold rule](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/8-week-hold/) when it rose more than 20% from the buy point.


MarketSmith Helps You Draw A Watch List -- Fast
-----------------------------------------------


One of the best places to find stocks to buy is the [MarketSmith Growth 250](https://marketsmith.investors.com/growth250/). The Growth 250 is a premium stock list that emphasizes high-quality growth stocks.


Particularly during stock market corrections, investors should be focusing on stocks with strong relative strength lines. Those are stocks that are strongly resisting the downtrend. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the general market.


When the stock market triggers a follow-through, investors already should have a solid watch list of strong growth stocks that are getting ready to break out.

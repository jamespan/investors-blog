The idea of a diverse portfolio appeals to many investors. "I am broadly diversified," a cautious investor might say. "It minimizes my risk."




Diversification can lower your risk, as it minimizes the exposure an investor has to any one stock. But too much diversification carries risks most investors fail to consider.


Tracking more stocks means less time to track any one company. It also leaves an investor less able to monitor the broad market. As a result, you can miss cues, which typically leads to weaker results.


So, if rephrased, the widely diversified investor might just as easily be saying, "My attention is spread thin. I have diluted my concentration and slowed my ability to react to market changes."


Broad diversification is often a hedge for ignorance, wrote [IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) in "How To Make Money In Stocks." A concise, tightly managed group of holdings shows an astute investor unwilling to allow weak investments to dilute stronger ones.


How Much Diversification When Investing In Top Stocks?
------------------------------------------------------


As a guideline, an investor with \$20,000 to \$100,000 might hold no more than four to five stocks. If an investor has only \$5,000 to \$20,000 to invest, three stocks might be appropriate. A rookie who has only \$3,000 to invest, might hold two stocks.

Rather than excessive diversification, a better tack is to put more money into a portfolio's top performers. Alert investors should have a sense of which stocks are acting as leaders and which ones are slowing or possibly nearing a top.


As certain stocks prove to be winners, they provide chances for an attentive investor to add to a position. These add-on buy points can produce big returns. The process of rotating capital out of weaker stocks into stronger ones keeps the number of stocks in a portfolio in check.


Jesse Livermore's Method
------------------------


This buying method, called "pyramiding," was defined by Jesse Livermore in 1940. Pyramiding is a powerful tool, but also carries some risk.


Learning to recognize and take advantage of add-on buy points requires study. But the study time is often well worth the reward. And it employs every investor's most critical asset: an active, engaged mind.


Amazon's Big Run
----------------


Online retailer **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) broke out of a [14-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) in the week ended April 15, 2016. ( You can see a historical chart of Amazon with any start point or end point at [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).) The [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) was 603.30.


Amazon then advanced, pausing to form four additional bases on its journey higher. Amazon peaked the week of Sept. 7, 2018, at 2,050.40, giving the investor a gain of 240%.


If you owned 20 other stocks in your portfolio at the same time, you would have severely diluted those gains.

When it comes to colorful answers, few people can compete with conspiracy theorists.

Ask these imaginative souls who controls the stock market.

Answers read like a paperback thriller novel: the Trilateral Commission, the Federal Reserve, the National Security Agency, the Jesuits, the Chinese government or a vague but no less sinister "small group of rich men."

The truth is not nearly as interesting. Two very boring guys named Mr. Supply and Mr. Demand control the stock market.

When demand is high and supply low, prices rise.

When supply is high and demand low, prices drop.

Here are things to consider when evaluating supply and demand — the fourth element in the [CAN SLIM investment strategy](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2).

• **Corporate buybacks:** A sizable buyback program can boost demand at critical junctures, providing a price floor for a stock when it is in a downtrend and providing additional thrust when a stock is in an uptrend.

Buybacks also reduce the supply of shares available for trade. This adds a bullish tilt.

During the bull run since 2009, corporate buybacks have provided most of the fresh money going into the market, observers say.

• **Secondary offerings:** Some secondary offerings boost the number of shares available for trade. This increase in the number of shares makes it tough on bulls, unless it's a thin stock that needs liquidity.

Some secondary offerings do not increase the share count. The offering merely lets major shareholders unload shares without creating too much price chaos. Once that is over, things can go back to normal.

• **Fund buying or selling:** Heavy institutional buying or selling affects demand for a stock.

Ways to look for this include: the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which gauges action over 60-65 days; and the up/down volume ratio, reflecting the past 50 days of action.

Also use daily and weekly charts for significant gains or losses in above-average volume.

• **Stock splits:** This increases the supply. Bullish price action rarely follows oversized splits.

• **Supply/Demand Rating:** This screen weighs institutional demand — identifying top-rated stocks with heavy trading activity in relation to their supply of shares. The list of stocks is often short for this screen. Sometimes no stock makes the screen.

The rating is found on some IBD charts. Those with a high rating are listed in the B section, often under the New Highs list.

**Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) ran like a champion earlier this year.

Then it turned down hard.

The exits on Aruba's peak might not have been as clearly marked as other big winners' tops. But the stock did flash key sell signs. And the final exit on Aruba's peak in 2011 was a clear one.

The stock could return to that level if the company's growth and institutional demand remain strong. But with a 55.5% drop in its current base, Aruba has work to do.

Aruba designs software systems that securely link mobile users of smartphones, notepad and notebook computers to wired networks. That bustling market spurred the stock's breakout from what was at least a third-stage base in January. It pulled back, triggered the 8% sell rule, then launched into the biggest weekly gain of the advance **1**.

Both of those moves should have put investors on notice, but were not sufficient to begin shaking holders out of the stock (other than those who had just tried to jump in at the late-stage breakout).

Most durable investors would have continued to hold as Aruba undercut its 10-week moving average, but in light volume, on April 12. By week's end, it rallied back above the line **2**.

The state of alert rose in late April, when the stock climbed to new highs in light volume, an early sell sign **3** (see a daily chart to see such action on April 29 and May 2).

Aruba then pulled back in modest, yet higher, trade to test its 10-week line. That formed a part of what would become a head-and-shoulders topping pattern **4**.

Volume grew as Aruba cut its 10-week line in a big loss on May 16. Investors would have been taking some profits here, and on high alert. On a daily chart, you can see that shares climbed back above the 50-day moving average. But on May 19 it reversed to the day's low in heavy action. Time to sell more.

May 20 was the moment of truth: Aruba ripped through the 10-week line in huge trade **5**. Time to go.

Sell decisions can be tough. Sell too early, and you feel like you missed extra profits. Wait for the big drop and you may feel like you are selling too far off the top.

The key is to know your sell signals. Even if you sold at the bottom of May 20's 17% drop, you would have still ended 11% above Aruba's January buy point of 24.38.

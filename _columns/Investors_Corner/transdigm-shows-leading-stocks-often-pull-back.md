Investors may be tempted to buy a strong stock that has risen just past a permissible buying range. But history shows that it's best to wait for a pullback before jumping in.

  

IBD research shows that up to 40% of the top performers retreat to their ideal buy points after breaking out of a sound base.

  

Pullbacks reflect profit-taking. They often occur when a stock breaks out at or near its high, as some investors sell into strength, thinking the shares have peaked.

  

But IBD-style investors know that the general uptrend of true leaders — those with strong fundamentals and solid chart patterns — won't be disturbed by a brief shakeout. The pullback to the stock's buying area — ranging up to 5% from the buy point — gives investors a second chance to buy or add to their positions before the stock resumes its run.

  

Keep in mind that buying a stock that's more than 5% above its buy point is risky, because it leaves investors vulnerable to being shaken out during a routine pullback.

  

**TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) rallied past a 57.41 buy point from a cup base on Aug. 10, 2010 in more than double its average daily volume **1**.

  

There were a number of drawbacks to the aircraft parts maker's breakout. One, the market was in correction. Two, the stock's fundamentals were respectable but not quite as strong as you'd like to see.

  

Sure enough, the stock quickly retreated, sinking 4% below its buy point on Aug. 24, though not enough to trigger the 8% sell rule **2**. Those who had held onto the stock were rewarded several days later, when the shares climbed back above the buy point in above-average trade.

  

On Sept. 1, the market followed through, shifting the market in a new uptrend, and TransDigm's fundamentals had improved. Its Composite Rating had risen four points to 93, its Earnings Per Share Rating had climbed five points to 71 and its Relative Price Strength Rating was up five points to 91.

  

TransDigm's SMR Rating of A indicated superior sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. Its Accumulation-Distribution Rating was C+, still positive despite the market's correction.

  

The stock climbed 49% by February 2011, testing its 10-week moving average several times along the way.

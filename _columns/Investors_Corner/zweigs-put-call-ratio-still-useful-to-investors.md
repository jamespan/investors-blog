  Why Martin Zweig's Put/Call Ratio Is Still Useful To Investors

Reality vs. a newspaper's version of reality can be radically different. It's like the difference between "inside baseball" vs. what sports writers buzz over. This happens in investing, too.


When the great investor Martin Zweig died in 2013, many newspaper obituaries gushed over Zweig's prediction of the 1987 stock market crash. On Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, Zweig said on the TV program "Wall Street Week" that he was "looking for a crash." The following Monday, the S&P 500 fell 20% in one day.


Not to take anything away from Zweig, but this was not his finest moment. (The prediction was not actionable, and the S&P 500 had already slid 16% since August. As William O'Neil pointed out in the book *How to Make Money in Stocks*, "Before the market broke wide open in October 1987 ... there was ample time to sell and cut losses short. That correction actually began on August 26.")


For the inside investing set, Zweig's crowning achievement came in 1969, when Zweig was a graduate student working on his Ph.D.


His dissertation -- "An analysis of risk and return on put call option strategies" -- involved the invention of the put/call ratio. To this day, the put/call ratio is a useful secondary indicator.


The put/call ratio is a contrarian sentiment gauge. A put is an option that gives the right to sell a stock at a specific price within a certain time range. A call is an option that gives the right to buy at a specific price within a certain time range. So the puts essentially reflect bearish sentiment, while the calls reflect bullish sentiment.


Option investors are notorious for being wrong. So a high ratio of puts to calls (which reflects bearish conviction) is often seen near market lows, just before the market turns up.


IBD plots a daily chart of the ratio on the General Market Indicators chart page. (The link is found at the bottom of IBD's daily [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).) A ratio of at least 1.15 at the close is often found near market bottoms. You can also track the put/call by going to IBD's "Psychological Market Indicators" section, found under "[Market Trend](http://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx)" in the main navigation bar at Investors.com.)


Because the put/call ratio is a secondary indicator, it doesn't always work. But it's been fairly accurate this year.


Readings at or above 1.15 proved premature in January. On Jan. 7 and 8, the put/call ratio hit 1.23. On Jan. 15, the ratio hit 1.33. From these dates, the Nasdaq had 5% to 10% lower to go before turning up.


On Feb. 8, the put/call closed at 1.16. The Nasdaq's intraday low of 4212.81 came close to matching the intraday low of 4209.76 three sessions later. An advance in the Nasdaq of almost 18% followed.


Readings of 1.15 and 1.19 on May 13 and 19 also pegged low areas, but subsequent rebounds in the Nasdaq were only about 6%. Readings of 1.17 and 1.21 on June 24 and 27 identified market lows. The Nasdaq rebounded 13% to 16%.

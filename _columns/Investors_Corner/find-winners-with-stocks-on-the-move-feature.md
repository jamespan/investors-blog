**How To Profit From MAKING MONEY:** [First In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/603354/201203061545/how-to-profit-from-ibds-making-money-.aspx)


IBD's Making Money section offers plenty of tools and articles to help make readers even better investors â€” fast.


One key feature is the NYSE + Nasdaq Stocks On The Move table except for Mondays. On Mondays, you can also find a weekly version of the NYSE + Nasdaq Stocks On The Move. The table also appears on the home page of Investors.com and is updated throughout the trading session.


Unlike other "most active" tables showing stocks that simply traded the most number of shares during a single session, Stocks On The Move gives you actionable information. In a nutshell, it'll tell you what's being bought and sold by institutions in dramatic fashion.


Stocks On The Move can point you to leading stocks breaking out of base patterns or those clearing secondary buy points. These tables also help you identify high-quality names that are forming their bases or are getting ready to break out.


Investors can use the feature not only to find watch-list candidates; it can also be used to gauge the market environment. In a healthy market, you should see many leaders rising in big volume. A number of leaders falling in above-average volume can be a bad sign for the market.


What makes Stocks On The Move different is that it highlights stocks that had the greatest percentage changes in volume compared with their daily average over the past 50 trading sessions.


To make it on the list, stocks must be priced \$20 or higher for the NYSE and \$16 or higher for the Nasdaq. Stocks must have a price change of at least plus or minus 50 cents. And a stock's 50-day average volume must be above 60,000 shares.


The criteria for stocks rising in price get more restrictive. They must have Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength Ratings of at least 70 and their Accumulation/Distribution Ratings must be D+ or higher. Lastly, a stock's next year's EPS estimate must be 15% or higher than its prior year's earnings.


Stocks with EPS and RS Ratings of 80 or higher as well as being up in price for the day are boldfaced. The reason: so you can quickly identify the market's best stocks.


Look at the volume percentage change figure column on the far right. The higher the volume percentage change, the better. Turnover is vital when a stock breaks out. The more volume, the higher the conviction. Each day, look at the stocks with the biggest percentage changes and see if they cleared bases or other buy points.


**TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)), a maker of aerospace parts, appeared at the top of the Stocks On The Move table in the Jan. 24 edition of IBD. On Jan. 23, the stock blew past a 99.53 buy point **1** from a cup with handle in volume that surged 164% above average (weekly chart is shown). It has gone on to rise 22%.

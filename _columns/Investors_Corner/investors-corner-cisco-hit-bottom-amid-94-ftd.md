**IBD Special Series:** [Major Follow-Throughs](/NewsAndAnalysis/SpecialReport/572707/201105231515/Major-Follow-Throughs.aspx)

1994 certainly had its fair share of big events, and a key one for IBD-style investors was the follow-through day on July 13.

This column in our series about follow-throughs will look at that sign of a new market uptrend.

IBD defines a follow-through as the time when a major index closes up sharply for the day in higher volume. Follow-throughs often occur from the fourth through seventh day of an attempted new rally.

As noted in Friday's column, it's often tough to act on follow-throughs. Headlines and analysts often will be negative, making it hard to focus just on how stocks are actually behaving.

There was certainly an element of that around July 13, 1994.

Investors Intelligence said the percentage of investment advisers who were bullish had slid to 23.3%, a five-year low. The Nasdaq had fallen 14% since March. Of course, as IBD noted at that time, the sentiment reading should have been taken in a contrary way as a positive. You should worry when most advisers are upbeat.

In an interview with IBD that week, one market strategist captured the mood by saying: "Right now, I sense a lack of interest by most investors. It's hard to go long and expect much. That's why I'm advising action by only short-term traders and cautious buying by those who are long-term oriented."

So much for that strategist. The follow-through happened a couple of days after that statement.

It came on the Nasdaq, which rose 1.4% on July 13 on Day 12 of a new rally as trade surged 37% **1**. The market got a lift that session from **Comcast**'s ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) plan to buy the part of QVC Network that it didn't already own. A strong Q2 report from Chipcom also provided a boost. The report helped networkers in particular, including **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), which went public in 1990.

Not all follow-throughs work. It helps to study leaders as you assess one. It turns out Cisco formed the bottom of a new base in the week ended July 15, 1994.

The market corrected again in November, but the key indexes didn't undercut their lows. The NYSE and S&P 500 followed through Dec. 14.

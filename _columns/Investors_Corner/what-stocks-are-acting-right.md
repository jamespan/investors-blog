When the stock market is under pressure, two things can attract attention.

Foremost are those stocks that are acting nonchalant — no big volume, no big losses, no big deal. These are the cool stocks. Many times the cool set is where the sector rotation is going.

The cool stocks have a shot at becoming leaders — no guarantees but a shot.

The second group are those stocks that are getting knocked back to a key line of support, such as a 50-day moving average. These stocks are either on the ropes and about to get knocked through the ropes, or they are about to spring off the ropes and rally aggressively.

The Big Cap has some of both groups, according to the preliminary list.

On Monday, two brokerage stocks were acting cool. **Charles Schwab** ([SCWB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCWB)) lost 10 cents to 28.43 in volume 19% below average. The action was an inside day — with the low staying above the previous day's low and the high staying below the previous day's high.

An inside day is generally pausing action. It's as if the stock is saying, "Don't rush me. I'll get around to doing what I'm going to do by my own clock."

**TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) also stayed cool. The stock fell 27 cents to 35.05 in volume a third slower than usual.

Both stocks recently broke out and are in the 5% buy zone.

Stocks falling back to their moving averages make up a longer list. If a stock makes the trip in quiet volume and rebounds in strong volume, then a secondary buy zone could emerge.

Online social platform operator **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is making its second trip to the 50-day line. The stock made a new high March 11 and then began to decline. Volume was mostly quiet. However, trade was 47% above average Monday as the stock dropped 3.14 to 64.10. Facebook closed slightly under its 50-day line. The roughly equivalent 10-week line looks uglier. The stock is 2% below the 10-week line.

Facebook could still bounce off the area strongly and rally. Individual investors, though, should buy only if volume points to institutional support.

Upscale electric automaker **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) came close to touching its 10-week line but bounced off the area. The stock skidded 8.72 to 220.17 in volume 13% above average. The action, though, had a positive angle. Tesla closed in the middle of the day's range, hinting at support.

For many individual investors, Tesla and Facebook could now become regret plays. Investors who missed the original breakout regret not buying. Psychologically, this can make for a tough situation, if the stocks establish a buy zone.

Taking a big position to try to make up for missing the first opportunity would be imprudent. Keep any purchases moderate and only if the market remains in an uptrend.

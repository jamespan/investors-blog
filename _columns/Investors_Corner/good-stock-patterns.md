All uptrends aren't created equal. Some price uptrends in the stock market feel like a direct flight on a fast plane. Others are like a freight train chugging along, occasionally even stopping for a while.

  

The uptrend confirmed by a [market follow-through](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/674820-how-bullish-is-the-ascending-base.htm). (See Monday's Market Pulse table on Page B9.)

  

A stock can't just go straight up under dicey market conditions. So, it advances higher and then retreats; advances higher and then retreats; and advances higher and then retreats.

  

That's what an ascending base does. There are three healthy price pullbacks of 10% to 20%, with each low higher than the preceding one. And the base shows three advances to new highs, with each high rising above the previous high.

  

**A Relatively New Discovery**

  

In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder William J. O'Neil notes, "Each of the pullbacks usually occurs because the general market is declining at that time."

  

Another thing to keep in mind is that the ascending base might look too late to investors who have a bargain mentality. "Ascending bases ... occur midway along a move up after a stock has broken out of a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base," O'Neil wrote.

  

**Titanium Metals** ([TIE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIE)) broke out of a base in mid-January 2005 (not shown on chart). The stock also cleared a consolidation in May to June 2005.

  

After a strong advance, Titanium in 2006 sketched an ascending base that lasted 15 weeks, within the usual time range of nine to 16 weeks.

  

At the base breakout, Titanium had a 93 Composite Rating. This signifies that the stock was superior to 93% of all companies in IBD's database based on a combination of IBD's proprietary rankings. The EPS rank was 55, the RS was 99, and the SMR grade was an A.

  

The stock broke out and gained 113% in seven weeks. A week after Titanium topped in mid-May, it made its third 2-for-1 split in less than nine months. That's a clear sell signal.

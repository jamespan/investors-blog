Sometimes stocks deserve a second chance. Let's say Stock A approaches a buy point but then drops suddenly. It then mounts a feeble comeback before plunging again, undercutting the previous low. The pattern just described looks like a W. It's called a double-bottom base. It tends to form during choppy markets when the major averages themselves might form a W-like pattern.

They're worth looking for because they can produce powerful breakouts when the market rebounds. So don't give up on these stocks despite their ragged action, especially if they have [strong fundamentals](http://education.investors.com/) such as solid profit and sales growth.

The second leg down of the double-bottom base should undercut the low of the first leg. This signals that weaker investors have been shaken out of the stock, positioning it for a strong rebound.

"Failure to undercut may create a faulty, more failure-prone" structure, wrote IBD Chairman William J. O'Neil in "How To Make Money In Stocks."

Like cup-type bases, the correction generally shouldn't be more than 40% to 50% from peak to trough. Double bottoms take seven weeks or more to form, about the same as cup-type bases.

The correct buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak of the W unless the pattern adds a handle, in which case it's 10 cents above the high of the handle.

Whether a stock breaks out from a handle or the top of the right side, look for volume to rise well above average as it clears the entry.

India's **Tata Motors** ([TTM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTM)) was one of the biggest winners of 2014 after it broke out of a double-bottom base on Valentine's Day.

But it didn't get off to an auspicious start. Investors could have easily given up on the stock after it sank more than 8% below a 32.55 flat-base buy point in the week ended Dec. 13, 2013 **(1)**.

Furthermore, its Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings were in the mid-70s, a bit weaker than you'd like to see but not bad for a big-cap stock.

However, Tata had begun to rebound from a series of profit declines. Earnings jumped 44% and 163% in the last two quarters of 2013. Sales rose 10% and 23% over that span on strong demand for the company's Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles in China and elsewhere. Tata purchased the brands from **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) in 2008.

Furthermore, the auto sector was ranked 4th out of the 33 sectors tracked by IBD.

Those who kept watching would have noticed that Tata's failed breakout coincided with the first leg down of Tata's double-bottom base. The second leg formed after a 16% decline in late January 2014 as the market corrected **(2)**.

The first clue that Tata's chart had taken a turn for the better came on Feb. 10, when the stock gapped up nearly 6% and retook its 50-day moving average. The gain was noted in IBD's "NYSE Stocks On The Move" table the next day. This was a valuable clue that fund managers were aggressively grabbing shares.

Volume was heavy again on Feb. 14, when Tata broke out above the 31.56 buy point. Over the next seven months, it climbed 55% to a near-term peak of 48.88.

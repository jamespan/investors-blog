**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

Most investors don't like volatility. One exception would be options traders who use it to capitalize on big moves in a stock. Excessive volatility can cause growth investors to get shaken out of a stock just days after buying it. It can also serve as a great time for long-time holders to sell and pocket their gains.

When a stock is building a base, the less volatile the price action, the better.

On a weekly chart, tight, orderly trade is shown by a few weeks in which the stock closes virtually unchanged from the prior week. Tightness also arises when the price range from weekly high to low is narrow.

Of course, tightness in a base is preferable to "wide and loose" erratic price swings. The latter often results in failed breakouts — another good time to sell a stock.

Tight closes and quiet trading as a base forms generally show investors have a high level of conviction in the stock. IBD research shows that these types of bases have a good track record of yielding successful breakouts.

A stock that trades erratically, either on a daily chart or weekly chart, is telling a story, and it's not a compelling one. It's a story of uncertainty, indecision and conflicting views among buyers and sellers, which does not bode well for future gains.

Some wide-and-loose bases form as a result of volatile, back-and-forth action in the broad market. Some breakouts can work from these patterns, but a whipsaw market is generally a good time to be selling stocks, raising cash and heading for the sidelines.

Odyssey Healthcare, acquired by Gentiva Health Services in 2010, cleared a second-stage base in the second quarter of 2003.

The stock ran up nicely from a buy point of 17.56, before settling into a third-stage base. A pullback of 28% wasn't extreme, but price action was volatile as the left side of the base formed.

The first distribution week showed a weekly high of 33.57 and a low of 26.37, good for a weekly spread of 27% **(1)**. It dropped 12% for the week. A few weeks later, Odyssey's second distribution week had a weekly spread of 21% **(2)**.

Odyssey showed reasonable accumulation when the right side of the base formed, but weekly spreads, though not as volatile as those seen on the left side, still gave pause. A breakout attempt during the week ended Dec. 4 turned ugly fast **(3)**.

Odyssey didn't form a handle in its base. But in other cases, wide-and-loose price action in the handle of a cup-with-handle pattern is also a big negative.

Wireless device firm Palm formed a cup with handle in the second half of 2004, but the one-week handle left a lot to be desired. It showed a weekly spread of 17%.

Volume, meanwhile, was above average and rose sharply from the prior week. That's called a distribution week, an unequivocal sign of institutional selling, and exactly what you don't want to see when a handle forms.

The result was the same — a nasty reversal on the breakout week. Palm fell 55% over the next four months.

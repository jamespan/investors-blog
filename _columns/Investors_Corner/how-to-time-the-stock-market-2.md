Apologies to T.S. Eliot, but October has historically been the cruelest month â€” in the market.

Since 1929, the original Roman Calendar's eighth month has seen some of the market's most brutal sell-offs. That was true in 1987, when global markets fell like dominoes, starting in Hong Kong mid-month and ending with the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow swooned 23% and the S&P 500 20% on the 19th, commonly called Black Monday.

Even before the tumble, stocks had been stuttering after a rally lasting three years. In 1987 alone, the Dow spired 45% from Jan. 1 to an Aug. 25 high of 2,746. The Nasdaq, which had yet to hit 500, surged 31% to a Sept. 1 peak.

Backing off those peaks, the Dow and the S&P spent September weaving above and below their 50-day moving averages.

By early October, investors were picking up mixed signals. The unemployment rate dipped to an eight-year low in September. Ore mining and chemical stocks hit new highs. A number of computer software and peripheral equipment makers were also posting solid gains.

On the other hand, roaring economic growth had investors fretting that the Federal Reserve was set to raise its target interest rate in a bid to tamp down inflation.

The rally was long in the tooth, and the market's progress had chattered back and forth for months. But starting with a stalling day on Aug. 21 1 and three distribution days within five trading sessions 2, the market began to show signs of unusually heavy professional selling.

Then investors received a clear message of market weakness on Oct. 6. The Dow dropped a record 92 points, 3.5% 3, as concerns about a Fed interest-rate move reportedly triggered an automated selling surge.

Dow volume was higher than the prior day, but still relatively mild. That eased some investor and analyst fears. But the loss cut the index's 50-day moving average, a crucial level of support.

What's more, the loss hoisted the Dow to four distribution days after gathering three in September. The S&P 500 added a distribution day Oct. 8, bringing its total to seven since Sept. 1.

The signals of institutional selling kicked in seriously on Wednesday, Oct. 14 4, when the Dow fell 3.8% and volume rose 30%. The same day, the Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit had narrowed less than expected, raising pressure on the Fed to raise rates.

Distribution days quickly compounded in rising volume. On Thursday the 15th, the Dow dropped 2.4% on a 65% increase in trade. On Friday the 16th, bears roared at the starting bell, driving the index down 4.6% 5. Volume soared 142%.

Monday brought the piece de resistance. IBD's "Inside The Market" headline read "Worst Day Of Modern Times" as the Dow plummeted 23% on a 250% rise over Friday's record volume.

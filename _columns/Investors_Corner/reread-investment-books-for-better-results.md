Most traders have likely run into rough patches in their investment journeys. Many have likely experienced spells where practically every trade that they put on went on to lose money. Or they end up with a series of investments that produced mediocre results overall.

  

There's no substitute for years of live trading under different market conditions. Yet in order to improve, investors sometimes need to go back and revisit their investment education roots. One way to get better results is to reread the books where you learned about the [CAN SLIM investment methodology](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) in the first place.

  

A future column on the topic of improving investment results will focus on attending one of the live [investing workshops](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=ibdevnt), which are great. IBD home study courses featuring the content of such workshops and [IBD University](http://education.investors.com/), found online on investors.com, give a serious investor the opportunity to repeat materials any time, any place.

  

Yet good investment books will always pose an excellent long-term method for learning, and they are cost-effective. Books allow you to learn and review principles on your own time and go about it on your own pace.

  

Most investors should go back and revisit "How to Make Money in Stocks" (HTMMIS), which is the bible of CAN SLIM investing. Even if you've read the book once or twice already or are doing pretty well in the market, spend some extra time and go over it, cover to cover. You might just find some gems of Bill O'Neil's decades of market knowledge that you previously missed.

  

If you've had poor results lately, ask yourself what exactly you're having trouble with. Is it market timing? The condition of the general market can have a big impact on whether you'll have a successful trade or not. Are you buying too late into a new confirmed uptrend? If so, go back to Chapter 9, "M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It."

  

Stock selection is key to great results. Are you buying the No. 1 or No. 2 stock in a highly rated industry group? These firms crank out innovative products and services that go on to dominate their respective industries. If you are not targeting such companies, read Chapter 7, "L = Leader or Laggard. Which Is Your Stock?"

  

A huge part of how you do in stocks involves selling. Are you taking gains once they amount to 20% to 25% when you have them? Nailing a few 20% to 25% winners in your portfolio can make for a good year.

  

And if you were lucky enough to catch some stocks that shoot up 50%, 75% or 100%, did you get out before they imploded after showing signs of climax action? If you're having trouble with this, revisit Chapter 11, "When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile Profits."

  

Identifying sound bases is also key. There are many charts going back more than 100 years for investors to study from.

  

Yes, there are many pieces of the investment puzzle that investors have to put together to get the picture right.

  

For investors that don't have the time to go through HTMMIS from cover to cover, then pick up a copy of "The Successful Investor." This book, penned by O'Neil in 2004 following the 2000-02 tech bear market, goes over many key topics in CAN SLIM investing. Think of the book as a lighter version of HTMMIS.

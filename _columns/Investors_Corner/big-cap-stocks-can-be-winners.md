  They Tend To Rise Slowly, But Big Cap Stocks Can Be Winners

The small-cap Russell 2000 has emerged as a leading market index so far this year, up 14%. In particular, it's outpaced the S&P 500 — home to many big cap stocks — and its 10% year-to-date gain.


Given this trend, it's worth asking: Have big caps abdicated the market's leadership to small caps?


While big caps lag in some respects, there are still plenty of leaders to be found. Some big caps sport solid fundamental growth, institutional sponsorship and strong management. Those standouts are quite capable of robust price advances.


That said, big caps and small caps are certainly different creatures.


Size Can Inhibit Big Cap Stocks
-------------------------------


Big caps — stocks with a market capitalization of \$10 billion or more — typically move slower than the rest of the market. They trade hundreds of millions of shares daily and are widely owned by institutional investors. Their sheer size, though, slows their price movements. Big caps are often mature companies whose fastest-growing years are behind them.


By comparison, smaller-cap issues sometimes act like rabbits. Their share prices tend to move faster. They also show more volatility, and can tumble a lot faster to boot.


Though they may not be new names anymore, some of the top-performing stocks can indeed be found in the big-cap field.


One place to find these top big-cap names is the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). You can see the entire list and a story in every issue of IBD Weekly. The list screens for the best-rated big caps. Each stock comes with a detailed weekly chart.


At the bottom of each chart, IBD market writers give a brief analysis of the price and volume action, with an eye toward the stock's relationship to its buy point or base pattern.


Big Cap 20 Outperforms Small Caps
---------------------------------


The [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) is up 15% this year, outperforming the small caps, thanks to the selectivity of the screen.


Besides the major indexes, another way to compare the performance of different-sized stocks is IBD's mutual funds section. There, as of Feb. 12, [a chart plots the one-year performance](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IBD1202153228MUTUALS.pdf) of a select group of funds focused on small-cap growth stocks vs. a group of big-cap growth funds. The current chart shows the big-cap camp has been outperforming since September. But small caps are outperforming in 2019.

_Fifteenth In A Series_

Mount Huashan in China has been called the most dangerous hiking trail in the world.

Breathtaking photos on the Internet show hikers on a plank path that's about a foot or two wide. On one side is rock and on the other is air. One slip and it's over.

People who would never consider hiking the Mount Huashan trail will do the equivalent in their portfolios. When a stock rises sharply over many months, at some point it becomes extremely dangerous.

The stock gets "priced for perfection," as old traders say. One little miss can bring a severe reaction.

History's greatest investors have an unshakable rule that helps them avoid this situation. It's called selling on the way up. You don't try to sell at the peak.

Let someone else earn those last few dangerous dollars.

Sometimes, however, you will misjudge the situation. You look at a chart one morning and realize the stock has already peaked.

Often, when a stock comes off a high rather sharply, there will be some minor recovery before it falls further. But it's best to sell immediately. You can't know for sure that the rebound will happen before or after another sharp decline.

In June 1999, **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) was an initial public offering. The stock sketched a short IPO base and broke out on July 30, 1999 **1**. These short IPO bases can be bought, but some investors prefer to wait for a conventional base.

Juniper formed a cup-with-handle base and broke out on Oct. 11, 1999 **2**.

Volume was 64% greater than normal when it cleared the 72.72 buy point.

Near the end of its 330% rise in less than six months, Juniper flashed some sell signals. The stock showed low volume as it made several new highs **3**.

What if an investor missed these sell signals? The daily chart shows that in the week ended March 31, 2000 **4**, Juniper suffered a 6% loss, a 7% loss and a 1% loss — all in fast trade. The stock was now 16% off its high. The disciplined investor — realizing that "sell on the way up" was no longer an option — would've sold immediately.

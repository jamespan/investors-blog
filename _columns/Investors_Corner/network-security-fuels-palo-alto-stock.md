Some stocks hit the ball out of the park while would-be investors gaze longingly from the sidelines.

You don't have to be one of the onlookers. With study, vigilance and proper due diligence, every stock market player can learn to spot leading stocks with the potential to hit a home run.

Regular IBD readers would have noticed **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), which has rallied as much as 123% this year, well ahead of its August breakout and subsequent run-up.

Leaderboard [subscribers](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) were alerted Feb. 4 as the network security infrastructure products maker was added to the Leaders List. The July 20, 2012, IPO was getting poised to clear a 65.02 buy point in what could be viewed as a long cup-with-handle base.

Palo Alto did so two sessions later in nearly quadruple its usual volume. It leaped 12% (please see a daily chart) that day after the company received a favorable ruling in a patent infringement dispute with **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)).

From there, the stock rose as much as 24% before pulling back to start shaping a new pattern. This time, it carved a double-bottom base with a 72.60 buy point. The stock got moved to the Cut List in early April as it fell sharply below its 10-week line.

It corrected as much as 29% during the second leg down, but found support at its 40-week line. Palo Alto returned to Leaderboard on May 28, a day before gapping up past the entry and soaring 5% in heavy trade.

So investors who missed out on the first breakout could have bought at this opportunity, if they were reading the market columns in the paper and online.

The April 21 IPO Analysis column pointed out Palo Alto may be forming a potential base while testing its 10-week line. The column appears in IBD's Tuesday and Thursday issues in the "Making Money" section.

A May 27 IBD Internet & Technology section article covered an analyst upgrade ahead of its quarterly earnings report.

The company's results after the close May 28 topped views, fueling the stock's May 29 breakout. After an 18% rise, the stock set up a new base, with a breakout past the 85.88 buy point on Aug. 13 **(1)**.

In September, Palo Alto cleared a 102.55 three-weeks-tight buy point **(2)**. It triggered a sell signal the following week, but has quickly recovered and is now up 19% from the entry.

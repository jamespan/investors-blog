The way a stock acts intraday and at the close can give an investor useful clues.

When an investor is studying a stock chart, he or she ought to entertain several questions about the day's action.

•Is the stock generally closing high in the day's range?

A high close is bullish. Just how bullish depends on the volume and the price gain. A low close is bearish, especially when accompanied by a wide daily range.

•Are there positive reversals?

When a stock declines, then reverses upward to erase most or all of the loss, buyers are clearly stepping in to take charge.

•Are there negative reversals?

A stock that rises but can't hold the gain is showing weakness.

•Is the daily range wide and loose, or is it tight?

Generally, tight action is good, and loose action is bad. Breakouts from bases with loose action often fail. But wide action can be good when a stock gaps up or charges ahead to close high for a big gain. A long line with a high mark for the close is ideal.

•Are the ranges and closes on the weekly chart showing a railroad-track pattern?

This two-week pattern involves a second week repeating the action of the first week. The closes meet on the chart to form a single line that looks like a railroad tie stretching from one rail to the other. This is a bearish pattern, especially when it occurs after a long run-up.

**Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) showed consistently good chart action as it rose from September 2013 to September 2014.

Still, chart action doesn't happen in a vacuum. Fundamentals and a stock's story are important.

In April 2013, the International Air Transport Association was reporting an industrywide acceleration in global-passenger traffic. In subsequent months, the situation only got better.

Meanwhile, mergers in the industry were reducing overall capacity, helping airlines avoid fare cuts.

How did Southwest fit this picture?

After nine quarters that included six declining or flat quarters in earnings, Southwest found traction. The company boosted earnings 162% in Q3 2013, then 267%, 157% and 84%.

Southwest Airlines' breakout on Sept. 19, 2013, emerged from a flat base. The stock cleared a 14.34 entry in twice its usual volume **(1)** and closed high in the day's range.

Days immediately after a breakout are critical. Southwest passed this test, too.

The stock showed only one day of hesitation. On Sept. 30, it fell 1.6% below the buy point intraday, but staged a positive reversal to wipe out most of the day's loss **(2)**.

From there, it was mostly a smooth flight upward. Southwest notched more than 150 up days during the 12-month run against fewer than 100 down days.

Generally, a close within the upper 60% of a day's price range is considered positive. Of Southwest's up days, seven of every eight had closes in the upper 60% of the range.

Meanwhile, of the down days, almost one of every three involved positive reversals — a decline that reversed to erase most of the day's loss.

From its breakout to its Sept. 18 closing high, Southwest gained about 145%.

  How To Invest In Growth Stocks: Use A Pyramid Approach To Limit Risk

For all their beauty and engineering brilliance, Egypt's pyramids possibly stand as history's most glaring example of eccentricity and excess.




Yet in the stock market, the word "pyramid" comes into play as a means of measured restraint.


For investors, pyramiding means to move into a stock in at least two or three progressively smaller purchases. The strategy has two key goals. The first is to limit how much new capital an investor exposes to risk. The second is to manage smartly the investor's average cost in the stock.


Beginning investors and those playing with comparatively small amounts of money may not necessarily use the technique. But as investors become more practiced they learn to move into a stock in stages, using follow-on buying opportunities and second- and third-stage bases. It allows an investor to rotate capital out of stocks that may not be performing as well, and into those that prove to be the leaders as a market uptrend progresses.

How To Pyramid Up In Top Growth Stocks
--------------------------------------


The challenge is to do it while keeping a close eye on your average cost.


Average cost describes your overall total cost per share in a stock. The more shares you buy at a higher price, the higher your average cost. Buying smaller amounts as a stock advances keeps that average down.


Buying too many shares at increasing levels can sharply reduce your profit cushion. It can lead to an overall loss should the stock pull back.


Let's say you built a \$100,000 position in Avago Technologies, now known as **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) after a mega merger, when it first cleared a buy point in mid-September last year.


The chip designer barely cleared the 39.84 buy point in that first move, so you waited before adding.


You added to that initial buy as the stock began to gain ground in heavy trade on Sept. 17 through 20 **(1)**. Now the stock is extended, out of buying range.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ICavgo032619-300x158.jpg)The stock formed another base in October to November. It broke out past a 47.31 buy point in heavy trade Dec. 5 **(2)**. It would have been reasonable to add more shares in the amount of, say, 20% of your initial stake, or \$20,000, if you had real conviction. Maybe you waited to see whether the breakout would prove to be a solid move.


The stock staged an orderly pullback over the next six sessions. It dipped less than 4% below the base's buy point — not a sign to sell the newly added holdings.


You would have filled out that position as the stock then retook the buy point in very heavy trade. The second-stage breakout had proved itself.


Your average cost has now risen, but it still skewed heavily toward your first buy.


Be Sure To Avoid A Top-Heavy Position
-------------------------------------


You could add a few more shares — perhaps \$5,000 or even \$10,000 worth — after it staged a 3-weeks-tight breakout at 54.27 in mid-January this year **(3)**, a rebound from 10-week support early in February, or a flat-base breakout in May **(4)**.


The stock fell sharply, pulling back to test 40-week support in October **(5)**. For investors who had bought and pyramided properly, the pullback would have been comfortable to sit through. An investor who added an unnecessarily large number of shares in May or August may have been forced to sell at least some shares, then stay on high alert until the stock rebounded.

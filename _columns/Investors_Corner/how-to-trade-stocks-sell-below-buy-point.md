If you are new to buying or selling growth stocks when they break out, you might wonder what to do when this happens: A leader crosses above a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), then falls below it by day's end. This is exactly what the biotech stock **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)), a former true market leader, did back in early 2013.




Should you sell and hit the ejector button?


Not always. Even if the stock is below your purchase price and beneath the proper entry, such action is not an absolute reason to exit the position. IBD research has found that as many as 4 out of 10 great winners will test the buy point after a breakout. Some stocks do so a few weeks after the start of a big move up. Others simply do so the same day as the breakout itself.



The time to sell quickly? When you have to [cut losses at 7% to 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). You could also get out if the price-and-volume action is repeatedly poor, as noted in an [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-growth-stock-golden-sell-rule-when-take-losses-fast/) published on June 29.


Volatile But Not Necessarily Bad
--------------------------------


A close below the breakout point could highlight worsening market conditions. Do you check IBD's current outlook regularly? See it in Market Pulse, found in each day's [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) column. If the market is selling off and the outlook is weak, consider raising some cash. Is it still a confirmed uptrend? If yes, then hold the stock.


It's always vital to check that you've picked a [true industry leader in a top-performing sector](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/leader-laggard/). Let's review Biogen as it vaulted past a 155.40 trigger point in a well-formed base on Jan. 28, 2013.


At one point, shares rallied 7.3% to as high as 156.94. Yet by day's end, Biogen had risen 2.6% to 149.99, nearly 6 points below the breakout point. Volume bulged 130% above the 50-day average, a good sign.


On Dec. 31, 2012, IBD upgraded the market outlook to "uptrend resumes" just as the Nasdaq gained 2% in heavy volume. By the time Biogen broke out, the Nasdaq marked only two distribution days, or significant declines by key indexes in higher volume. Therefore, the market was acting right.


A Sharp-Looking Chart Pattern
-----------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ICbiib070918-300x161.jpg)Biogen rallied more than 80%, peaked at 157.18 on Sept. 26, 2012 **(1)**, then formed the 18-week [cup with handle](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). A 14.8% drop within the base hinted that large funds weren't selling en masse. Biogen bottomed at its 200-day moving average, then rebounded within 2 points of the cup's left-side high. ([See a historical chart on MarketSmith](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF) to view the 200-day line.) The handle was long, yet Biogen didn't undercut the 200-day line again.


A 10% drop from the handle's high **(2)** to low met the maximum allowed decline of 12%. The handle slanted lower along the lows. Perfect. Why care about a good handle? Think of it as one final brief and light shakeout of uncommitted holders right before the stock muscles out of the base.


After the wild breakout day, big sellers hid in the shadows. Biogen rose in six of the next seven sessions. On Feb. 6 **(3)**, the stock traded 7.6% past the [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), [leaving the 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/). At the time, the firm was building its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera into a revenue powerhouse. Biogen's sales jumped 26% in 2013 to a record \$6.93 billion. Earnings grew 37% to \$8.96 a share.


Two years later in May 2015, Biogen peaked at 480.18, up 209%.

Frustrated that you missed a breakout opportunity to buy that stock you liked so much? Just wait a bit.

IBD research has found that up to 40% of great stocks pull back near to or all the way back to their ideal buy point after a breakout.

Pullbacks are natural. They reflect profit-taking, but if the stock is a true leader, its general uptrend will not be disturbed. So after a brief shakeout, big winners resume their price runs and hit new highs.

A brief pullback to the ideal entry price offers a second chance to buy or add to a position. If you're down just 2% or 3% in such a situation, don't sell. The 8% stop-loss rule has not been triggered. Also, the pullback will often be a test of the stock's 10-week moving average.

Before jumping in, make sure the overall market is in a confirmed uptrend, the stock is in a strong industry group, and volume dropped off during the pullback. If the stock passes those tests, there's a good chance that it will resume its climb.

**Rackspace Hosting** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)) broke out of a double-bottom base on Sept. 10, 2010, climbing above its 21.46 buy point **1** (weekly chart shown). The move came six trading days after the market followed through.

An IBD-style investor could have been forgiven for holding back, since volume was only 13% above average, well below the 40% spike you'd like to see.

Yet the stock kept rising, and volume in subsequent days and weeks picked up. After briefly dipping less than 3% below the 21.46 buy point, it shot up 16% in the week ended Sept. 24 in strong volume **2**, giving investors a second chance to buy. On Sept. 28, the shares hit 26.50, 23% above the buy point **3**.

Research shows it's risky to buy a stock that's more than 5% beyond its entry point. A pullback could trigger the 8% sell rule before the stock has a chance to rebound.

After the Sept. 28 peak, the stock began pulling back and volume trailed off. On Oct. 19, it tested its 10-week line and reached as low as 21.95 **4**, within the permissible buying range of up 22.53.

Here was another golden chance to buy shares or add to the position.

The stock eventually more than doubled from the second-chance buying opportunity, hitting a peak of 46.49 in May 2011.

On its breakout, Rackspace had strong IBD ratings, including a 98 Composite, a 95 EPS and a 91 for Relative Price Strength.

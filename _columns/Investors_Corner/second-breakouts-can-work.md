The adage, "If you don't at first succeed, try, try again" is valid in many areas in life as well as in trading stocks. Not everything goes according to plan the first time around. Sometimes it takes a stock a couple of tries or even more before a big rally finally gets going. So if the first breakout doesn't pan out, don't dismiss the stock just yet.

  

Remember that trading stocks is an uncertain venture. Even if you bought a leading stock with red-hot top- and bottom-line growth, coming out from a picture-perfect base in solid turnover, that doesn't mean that it's all good from there.

  

A breakout is a key event in a stock. After a consolidation period of weeks or months, the stock's coming-out party shows that buyers are back and ready to push shares even higher. And the move is even more convincing if it's accompanied by big volume.

  

It's tough to pinpoint exactly why a stock with such promising fundamentals and technicals goes nowhere or falters after breaking out. Sometimes it could be the general market. Remember: The direction of the market can have a big influence on the direction of individual stocks.

  

Buying stocks in a down market can be like swimming upstream. But a strong bull market will act as a tailwind to the majority of stocks.

  

So you can improve your odds for a successful trade if you buy only when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. Be sure to read the [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) every day to stay on the right side of the market.

  

Bad news from the company itself or from industry peers can also impede a [stock breakout](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735787&nav=IBDUCourse6), as can negative actions from analysts.

  

If a stock breaks out and then goes under the proper buy point, it's fine to buy the stock once again if it takes out the entry point, preferably in heavy turnover. Sometimes a stock may retreat to a support level, such as the 50-day or 10-week line.

  

Other times, a stock will go on and fall 8% below the point, marking a failed breakout. When a stock does that, investors should sell to avoid digging a even bigger hole.

  

But don't walk away completely, as the game may not be over quite yet. If the stock starts to come back and eventually goes on to take out the buy point again, that action is a perfectly fine entry point. Sometimes it's the second mouse that gets the cheese.

  

Success also depends on the character of the individual stock. Some issues just don't move around very much.

  

On July 26, 2013, shares of drugmaker **Actavis** ([ACT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACT)) cleared a 133.10 buy point from a flat base. Although volume was more than double its average that day **(1)**, the stock just meandered afterward. A pop on Aug. 14 in heavy trading pushed shares back above the 133.10 trigger, but the stock again did very little. It eventually pulled back to support near its 50-day moving average **(2)**.

  

Actavis climbed back above the buy point Aug. 29 but did so in weak turnover **(3)**. Some heavy buying finally entered the stock several days later, and the stock made slow but steady progress. It climbed 12% by early October before coming down for another test of its 50-day line. The stock reached the 20%-to-25% profit-taking zone in mid-November.

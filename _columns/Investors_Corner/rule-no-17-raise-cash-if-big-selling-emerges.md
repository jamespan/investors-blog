*Seventeenth In A Series*

  

When you're driving, there's a time to step on the gas pedal, a time to step off, and a time to hit the brakes. It's much the same in stock investing.

  

To be successful, investors should only buy stocks when the market is in an uptrend. On the flip side, investors should reduce their holdings or be out of the market entirely when the market gets rocky and goes into a downtrend.

  

And a bear market is the only time short sales should be made.

  

Smart investing requires that one be in sync with the overall market environment. In a raging bull market, investors should be buying stocks of high-growth companies that are breaking out of well-formed price patterns.

  

Take advantage of a bull market; that's when monster winners are born. This is especially key at the beginning of a new bull run. IBD research shows the best-performing stocks usually break out in the first 13 weeks after a follow-through.

  

The overall market environment makes the difference between having a winner and a loser. Most stocks rise in an uptrend. Think of an up market as a rising tide that lifts all boats and ships.

  

Good times, however, don't last forever. At some point, the market rally will end. This usually happens when the market suffers heavy bouts of professional selling, or distribution days.

  

A distribution day occurs when one of the major stock averages, namely the Nasdaq, NYSE composite or S&P 500, falls 0.2% or more in volume heavier than the prior session. As a rule of thumb, six or more distribution days within a period of 25 trading sessions can derail a rally. When this happens, it's a good idea to reduce your holdings. You don't want to give up all of your hard-earned gains or let a winner turn into a loser.

  

In late 2007, the market was rising in the face of some head winds. First, there were worries of big banks having to write off mountains of bad debt. Fears of a potential credit crunch grew.

  

On Oct. 11, 2007, the Nasdaq staged a downside reversal on the highest volume in nearly three months, marking a clear distribution day **1**. Over the next nine sessions, it added four more distribution days **2**.

  

The Nasdaq regrouped and hit a new high Oct. 31 **3** with a 1.5% gain. But the tech-heavy index fell right back down the next day, sliding 2.2% in even higher volume. That marked the Nasdaq's sixth distribution day over a period of 16 sessions **4**.

  

The Nasdaq dived more than 50% as Lehman Bros. went bankrupt and Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns all got absorbed by healthier banks. Many leaders fell 70% or more from their highs. The Nasdaq eventually bottomed out 17 months later in March 2009.

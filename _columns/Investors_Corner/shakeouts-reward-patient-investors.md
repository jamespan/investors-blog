[Shakeouts](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/671025-cup-with-handle-base.htm?Ntt=shakeout) are sharp sell-offs, usually in response to an analyst downgrade or some other event.

They are also a normal part of a stock's base-building effort.

Investors who have faith in a company's story and fundamentals and know how to analyze the stock's chart can tune out the noise. As long as the stock resumes quiet, constructive base-building action, there's no reason to worry.

Shakeouts typically occur in the handle of a cup-with-handle base, such as the one formed by **American Power Conversion** ([APCC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APCC)) starting in March 1991. The buy point was 24.35 before a 2-for-1 split in December of that year, or 10 cents above the high of the handle.

Ideally, handles should drift downward in low volume as the last of the weak holders exit, satisfied to get out of the stock with just a small loss or gain after sitting through the cup's steep correction. But the handle-forming action sets the stage for the stock's breakout to new highs.

American Power's handle pulled back in orderly fashion at first, before a nerve-rattling shakeout on June 24 and 25, during which the stock briefly pierced its 10-week moving average in heavy volume 1.

Skittish investors could have taken that as a sell signal, especially since the intraday low brought the handle's overall correction to 22%, far greater than the 8%-12% decline you'd like to see. But investors who waited to see how the stock closed that day saw it rebound back above the 10-week line and end near the top of its weekly range. That was a sign that institutional investors had stepped in to support the stock.

From there, American Power rose for five straight sessions and cleared the buy point July 12, up 9% to a new high in heavy volume.

American Power, a maker of surge protectors for computer networks, had a 98 Earnings Per Share Rating on the day of the breakout, just shy of the best-possible 99, indicating strong fundamentals. Its Relative Strength line was hitting new highs as it approached the buy point, another positive sign.

American Power went on to clear a flat base on Oct. 14, then pulled back to support at the 50-day line before going on a climax run, rising for nine out of 10 days. It hit a split-adjusted peak of 38.25 on Feb. 12, 1992, up 214% from the initial buy point.

The company was acquired by Schneider Electric in 2007.

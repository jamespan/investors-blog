  Powerful IBD Screen Sheds Light On Institutional Buying

Suppose a stock breaks out to a new high in light volume, rallies a few more days in light volume, then rolls over in heavy trade. So much for the breakout. It never really had a chance because there wasn't much conviction behind the buying.


What do you really want to see?


When a stock breaks out, expect it to race to a new high in heavy volume, follow through in heavy volume, and finally trade tightly above the buy point for the next several days.


This one worked because highly committed institutional investors were the fuel behind the buying. Some were building new positions in the stock; others were adding to current positions.


Stocks moving higher in heavy volume are generally better candidates for your watch list than those rising in light volume. The former are being accumulated by institutional investors such as mutual funds, banks and insurance companies.


An initial heavy-volume gain in a stock can be precursor to more heavy-volume gains because it can take a mutual fund manager several weeks to months to build a full position in a stock.


One way to track this activity is with NYSE and Nasdaq Stocks on the Move tables, found daily in IBD's "Making Money" section just above the start of the stock tables (today on this page). Stocks that rose and fell sharply in heavy volume are shown. Home in on leading stocks by looking at boldfaced stocks in the screen. These have EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings of 80 or higher.


Each stock's percentage change in daily volume is shown so you can how heavy volume was in a stock. A volume change of +100%, for example, means the stock on that day traded double its 50-day average volume.


In the Monday-dated weekend edition of IBD, check Page B2 for the Weekly Stocks on the Move screen. It's another great way to fill out your watch list, listing stocks with the biggest moves in heavy weekly volume.


An intraday version of Stocks on the Move is live on the home page of Investors.com. It starts updating around 10 a.m. ET. It continuously compares a stock's intraday volume with the average volume on an hourly pro-rated basis. To determine a stock's average hourly volume, simply take the stock's average daily volume and divide by 6.5. Now you know how many shares it generally trades each hour.

If you want to achieve the best possible performance in the stock market, doesn't it make sense to own the best companies with the best fundamentals?


Should those stocks also exhibit the best growth prospects and possess the best technical characteristics?


If you answer yes, then why would you want mediocre performers in your portfolio? They only hold you back.


That, in essence, is why in the long run, IBD screens like Sector Leaders outperform the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average by a country mile.


Sector Leaders is IBD's most stringent proprietary screen, sifting out stocks with the very best technical and fundamental characteristics. Sixteen names from the computer-driven screen are published each day on Page B1, except on Mondays, when it runs inside the B section.


If the computer can't find 16 names that cut the mustard, the list is shorter. Standards are not compromised.


An accompanying article each day (today on B1) highlights one or more of the [Sector Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/sector-leaders-review.htm) stocks or calls attention to a trend inside the list.


The Sector Leaders list should never be considered a model portfolio. Instead, think of it as a watch list of top stocks. Charts should be used to time buys and sells. The savvy [chart reader](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786&nav=IBDUCourse5) knows the safest place to buy is as a stock emerges from a sound base. Never buy a stock that is more than 5% extended from a buy point.


To help with buy and sell decisions, there is a weekly chart of each Sector Leader along with key IBD proprietary SmartSelect Ratings, including EPS, Relative Price Strength and Accumulation/Distribution. IBD's [Composite Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) combines five SmartSelect Ratings into a single number.


The SmartSelect Ratings are powerful tools. Buy stocks with high ratings, combine them with proper technical analysis and you have a winning formula.


A short blurb under each stock chart, updated daily by IBD's markets writers, tells the reader where the stock stands in terms of its cycle of bases and advances.


Over a five-year period ended July 28, the S&P 500 rose 87%, while Sector Leaders rose 263%. The Dow Jones industrials gained 65%.


To illustrate why Sector Leaders outperforms, the table above has the five stocks that have been in the Dow the longest, starting with **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)), which first made the list in 1896. It's only gained 59%, underperforming the Dow over the last five years. And that was the best of the lot.


**ExxonMobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) rose 33%, slightly better than half the Dow over the past five years.


The reason screens like Sector Leaders outperform is that they are constantly adding strength and tossing out weakness. Underperformers don't last long and the fastest growing names drive performance.


Also, Dow stocks, which are handpicked to represent sectors of U.S. industry, are mature companies. There's no need to hold a stock whose growth has petered out.


While an old dog can sometimes learn new tricks with a new product or market, the younger names that are just finding their stride and disrupting old markets by finding [new ways](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) to do things are the ones with stocks likely to soar.

Digging for the next big winner can take time, lots of it. You can spend endless nights poring over financial statements, magazine articles and analyst reports.

  

Or you can save a lot of time by letting IBD do the heavy lifting.

  

Two must-read sections in IBD, The New America and Internet & Technology, give you high-growth investment ideas every day.

  

While companies with solid earnings and sales growth are investors' usual targets, sometimes it pays to go beyond the numbers. Knowing exactly why a company is thriving can give you the conviction to make key trading decisions.

  

Companies featured in The New America are often younger, fast-growing firms with hot new products or services. These are sometimes lesser-known companies mentioned nowhere else.

  

Sometimes the simple matter of what a company does can be tough to figure out. New America articles break it down in plain English.

  

Readers can find out what's driving a company's top- and bottom-line growth. The feature points readers to the firm's competitive advantages and potential headwinds along the way. The New America and weekly Industry Snapshot also give readers a briefing on the industry and current developments.

  

Tech and Internet stocks often lead the market with big gains. The Internet & Technology section each day uncovers innovative companies with cutting-edge products and services. It'll help you stay abreast of what's happening in tech land, and feature the latest gadgets. At times, there are profiles and Q&A segments with company management and industry experts.

The **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) spin-off sold burritos, tacos and more with a twist. It focused on fresh, higher-quality ingredients. Its meats are raised with little or no antibiotics or hormones.

  

The company operated more than 500 restaurants. Its same-store sales grew at a double-digit pace for eight straight years. Its annual profit growth averaged nearly 200% in the latest three years.

  

The New America profiled Chipotle again in October 2006. The stock got moving when it broke out to new highs in May 2007 **1**.

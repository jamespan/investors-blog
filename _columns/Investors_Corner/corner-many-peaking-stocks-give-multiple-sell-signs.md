Some investors like to sell at predetermined levels, but sometimes you can just let the market tell you when to get out.

  

After long, sharp advances many stocks will show signs of weak action before, or just after, they peak.

  

Thanks to solid demand from China, India and Russia for coal, mining equipment maker **Joy Global** ([JOYG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JOYG)) brought shareholders much joy before falling apart.

  

Joy Global blasted out of an eight-week cup base Nov. 29, 2005, clearing a 34.99 buy point **1**. Over the next two weeks, Joy formed a three-weeks-tight pattern.

  

Joy Global leapt 71% by early March 2006 before pulling back near its 10-week moving average. It resumed its uptrend soon after.

  

In April 2006, Joy Global started showing its first signs of weakness. On April 17 to April 19, the stock hit three straight record highs in below-average trade **2**. This is a red flag. It suggests institutions are no longer buying the stock. When a stock lifts to a new high, you want to see heavy volume. That tells you the professionals such as mutual funds and hedge funds are supporting the stock.

  

Remember, it takes institutional buying to move a stock substantially higher, not a one- or two-lot order from Uncle Bob.

  

On April 20, Joy Global reversed from a new high in slightly above-average trade. The next trading day, it hit another new high in weak volume.

  

Then on April 27, the stock tumbled as much as 17% intraday before closing down 11% and above its 50-day moving average **3**. Still, the drop marked the biggest one-day point drop since the breakout — a change in the stock's character.

  

Joy Global rebounded initially in heavy trade, but volume tapered off as the stock neared its April 21 peak — another warning sign **4**. On May 11, it reversed in heavy trading. Two sessions later, it gapped down and closed below its 50-day line for the first time since the breakout **5**. Those that didn't sell on the first two red flags now had more reasons to sell.

  

By late July, the stock was more than 50% off its April peak.

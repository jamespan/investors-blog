One of the biggest stock market fallacies is that investors can't time the market and identify market bottoms. That's just not true.

Throughout market history, a specific signal — called the follow-through — has appeared at every stock market bottom.

A 40%-plus gain for the Nasdaq composite in 2020, for example, started with a follow-through day on April 6, 2020.

## Stock Market Bottoms

To identify this signal, start by looking for an initial rally attempt in the Nasdaq or S&P 500. Any rebound from an index low will do. It can be a 0.1% gain or a 1% gain. As long as the index holds above its latest low, the rally attempt is intact.

Short-covering can give the market a temporary boost. So wait for the first three days to pass, and look for a follow-through on the fourth day or later of a rally attempt.

The follow-through will come in the form of a big percentage gain — at least 1% but preferably more — in higher volume than the previous session.

Higher volume is important because you want to see signs of institutional buying in the early stages of a new uptrend.

Of course, follow-through days don't have a 100% success rate. The ones that fail often show signs of distribution soon after the follow-through day. A [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) is a higher-volume decline for an index, and it's a sign of institutional selling.

The strongest follow-throughs tend to occur after a big drop in the stock indexes. Follow-throughs after a quick 5% pullback might not work as well as one that occurs after a 10% sell-off. The Nasdaq's follow-through day in April 2020 came after a harsh 30% bear market for the index.

## 2020 Follow-Through Days

In the second half of 2020, the Nasdaq pulled back 13% starting in September. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only index to follow through after that pullback. It rose 1.2% in higher volume on Sept. 30 on the fifth day of its rally attempt. But the follow-through day didn't have much staying power. Usually, follow-throughs happen on the Nasdaq or S&P 500.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IC101121-279x300.jpg)In mid-October 2020, the Nasdaq pulled back sharply again, which ultimately spawned follow-through days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The S&P 500 followed through first with a big percentage gain in higher volume Nov. 4 **(1)** as volume rose from the prior day **(2)**.

That was three days from its low. Wasn't that too soon, since the signal comes at least four days from a low? In this case, the S&P 500's close in the upper half of the bottoming day's range served as Day 1 of the rally attempt.

The Nasdaq followed through on the fifth day of its rally attempt, rising 2.6% in higher volume Nov. 5, 2020.

The follow-through days worked well, helped by a large number of technology stocks that were coming out bases at the time like **Palantir Technologies** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)). Other notable breakouts around that time included **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)), **Element Solutions** ([ESI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESI)) and **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)).

Remember that follow-through days tend to work best when the market serves up plenty of actionable setups among top-rated growth stocks. The reason the April 2020 follow-through days worked so well was because of strong breakouts from likes of current Leaderboard stocks like **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)).

Also keep in mind that new leaders can emerge several weeks after a follow-through.

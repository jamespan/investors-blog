The idea of buying a falling stock seems simple enough, but can leave the novice nursing heavy losses. But the danger of trying to catch a falling knife can be controlled with judicious use of the concept of support.




Careful study of a stock's moving averages is a good way to judge when a stock is getting support. This is because institutions often use these gauges to increase their holdings in a favored stock.


Arguably the most useful of all these are the 10-week or 50-day moving averages, which are plotted on IBD and [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) charts. Small investors also can use these pullbacks to buy shares, although it is best to buy a smaller amount than at a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) from a base.


MarketSmith chief Scott St. Clair told Investor's Business Daily that pullbacks to moving averages are a great way to join in on an upward move on fancied stocks.


"If I miss a breakout, then my favorite way to try to catch a leader is a pullback to that 10-week line," he said.


Support doesn't always appear at moving averages. It also can surface at price levels where the stock or index repeatedly rebounds over many weeks or months.


Canny investors who put this principle to work when [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Generac** ([GNRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNRC)) tested its 10-week line in September 2020 would have seen their investment swell by triple digits.


Generac Stock Retreats To 10-Week Line
--------------------------------------


Generac broke out of a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) on May 18, 2020. The buy point was 105.36. The first pullback to the line came in June and found support. By the time it pulled back to its 10-week line for a second time in late September, it had already run as much as 84% above the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ICgnrc051021-300x161.jpg)Those who missed the initial move were handed a golden opportunity to get on board when it fell back once again to its 10-week line **(1)**.


Careful stock pickers would have noticed the fact the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) (not in the illustration) did not dip during its decline, which hinted there was underlying strength.


The downward move came amid [lower than average weekly volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/high-volume-key-open-sesame-moment-for-stock-move/), which suggests weak holders, rather than institutions, were driving the move.


Growth Stock Finds Reinforcement, Charges Higher
------------------------------------------------


This proved to be the case, as the stock punched back by posting two consecutive positive weeks in higher volume **(2)**. The rebound triggered a buy point of 174.28, based on its 10-week moving average at the time the stock touched the line.


Generac continued to drive higher, rising above its 10-day and 21-day lines, before building a new cup base after hitting the 234.55 mark. Taking profits here was an option, and would have netted a gain of around 35%. The stock went on to reach a high of 364 on Feb. 22, which represents a gain of 109% on its rebound entry.

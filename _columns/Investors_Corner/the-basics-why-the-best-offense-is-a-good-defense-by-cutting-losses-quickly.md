A baseball or basketball team will have a tough time without a good defense. Likewise, making money in stocks is challenging without a sound selling strategy.

Half the battle is buying the right stock at the right time, but it's equally important to know when to sell — on the upside and the downside.

Whether the stock didn't pan out the way you hoped or the market falls into a correction, you risk losing far more money if you don't have a set cutoff point at which to get out of a losing position.

That's why IBD often stresses the importance of the 7%-to-8% sell rule. If a stock falls 7% or 8% below your buy point — not its peak price — exit the position without asking questions. Don't let a small loss spiral into a bigger one.

"The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you're wrong," founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

It's also important to keep in mind that there are times when you don't have to wait for a stock to fall 7% to 8% from the entry before cutting it loose. That rule of thumb is the absolute limit. Investors are at greater risk of losses when the market uptrend is under pressure or in correction.

So when the market isn't in a confirmed uptrend and a stock you own isn't behaving well, it's perfectly acceptable to get out of a position ahead of a 7% to 8% decline. In this case, cut your losses at 3% to 5% to help preserve your capital. You can then put those funds to work in better-performing stocks or raise cash for the next uptrend.

Staying mostly in cash is prudent when the market is in a steep correction or a bear market. When the market is in an uptrend but trading is choppy, aim to sell positions at an even lower threshold, perhaps at 2% or 3% below the buy point.

![IC_len_122016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IC_len_122016.png)Take **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), for example, back in 2013. The homebuilder emerged from a V-shaped cup base on March 20 in heavy volume. The next session, it pulled back to form another similar cup base. Lennar climbed past a new buy point at 44 on May 14, but closed slightly below it.

Lennar attempted to clear the entry, but reversed lower after hitting intraday highs **(1)**. Then the stock fell further in heavier trade. It fell more than 5% intraday from the buy point, before settling for a 3.9% loss from the 44 entry by May 22.

The stock staged a 3% upside reversal in fast turnover the next day, though it failed to reclaim its buy point. Lennar again fell as much as 5% during a bearish reversal two sessions later **(2)**.

That turned out to be the last-ditch chance to cut losses short. On May 29, the stock sank 4%, slicing its 50-day moving average in heavy volume to fall more than 8% below the buy point **(3)**. From there, it fell as much as 30% from the 44.40 peak to its mid-August low.

In addition to a lack of upside volume, Lennar's relative strength line (please go to a [Marketsmith chart](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen&src=A012BF2) or [IBD chart](http://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) at Investors.com to see the RS line, painted in blue) lagged as it tried to break out. Distribution days had also been piling up in the market while Lennar was working on both bases. Shortly after the stock's breakdown, the market outlook changed to under pressure, and by mid-June to a correction.

  How To Invest In Stocks: Why IBD Rules Make Portfolio Management Intuitive

IBD rules can make portfolio management intuitive. And rules are absolutely critical for those who want to succeed when it comes to how to invest in stocks.




Intuitive means the rules naturally adjust exposure, according to [what's happening in the market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) and what's happening to the stocks in an investor's portfolio.


Here are four ways IBD's stock-investing rules can make portfolio management easy.


**No. 1: Position concentration**. This lets investors step up or step down exposure quickly. If the investor normally carries zero to five stocks in their portfolio — depending on the overall stock market — then exposure can be increased or decreased in 20% chunks.


How To Invest In Stocks: Cranking Exposure Up Or Down
-----------------------------------------------------


Imagine holding shares of one company's stock — and thereby being 80% in cash — during a [stock market correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/). When the market shifts to [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), the investor might buy shares of another company, thereby stepping up exposure to 40%. If the new stock is working, buying another [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) lifts exposure to 60%. This continues until 100% exposure is reached.


If any of the [new buys on a breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) fail, the stock should be sold, letting exposure drop.

This approach naturally calibrates exposure to performance.


Cut Losses Quickly
------------------


**No. 2: Keep losses small**. Many investors are familiar with the [7% to 8% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/), but they forget that this is the worst loss they should be taking. Investors who know how to read a chart can often get out quicker. In "How to Make Money in Stocks," (IBD founder) William O'Neil observes that "The average of all your losses should be less, perhaps 5% or 6%, if you're strictly disciplined and fast on your feet."


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ICulta021819-249x300.jpg)O'Neil adds this valuable observation: "If you use charts to time your buys precisely off [sound bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) ... your stocks will rarely drop 8% from a [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). So when they do, either you've made a mistake in your selection or a general market decline may be starting. This is a big key to your future success."


**No. 3: Take most gains when they reach 20%**. Stocks with elite fundamentals can sometimes rise much further, but stocks in the tier below elite will usually consolidate after a 20% gain.


Applying The Rules To Ulta Beauty
---------------------------------


**No. 4: Don't let a double-digit percentage gain cycle into a loss**. A recent example of this is **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)). The stock broke above a 290.39 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in the week ended Nov. 9. Weekly volume was strong **(1)**. Ulta advanced 11% in about two weeks.


But the gain didn't hold up. In the week ended Nov. 23, Ulta's gain at one point shrank to 3.6%. In the week ended Nov. 30 **(2)**, the gain shrank to less than 1%. An IBD-style investor would've sold to prevent a turn to red.


During the next four to five weeks, Ulta fell as much as 22% below the 290.39 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Such a decline forced investors to cut losses short. Since then, Ulta has formed a new base, a [12-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). It cleared the new entry of 294.54. Through Thursday trading, Ulta remained in the [proper buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).

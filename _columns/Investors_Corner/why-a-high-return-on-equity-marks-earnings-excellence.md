Return on equity is a measure of a company's profitability. It's also an important tool for investors who are searching for great stocks. Why? ROE may help you gauge a stock's chances of success.




ROE is calculated by dividing net annual income (before accounting changes and one-time gains or losses) by average shareholders' equity over the past two years. Shareholders' equity, which is equal to total assets minus total liabilities, is also referred to as owners' equity, book value or net assets.


Essentially, ROE helps to identify well-managed companies by measuring how much profit a company generates from its total net assets. For example, a company that earns 10 cents on each dollar of equity has an ROE of 10%.


Picking Great Stocks: Why Return On Equity Matters
--------------------------------------------------


IBD research shows that the greatest growth stocks of the past 50 years had ROEs of 17% or more. The biggest winners had ROEs of 25% to 50%. (The accompanying table shows a selection of top winners in 2016.)

Such companies typically have a competitive advantage that gives them a leg up on the competition, whether it's a new product or new service, or new method of doing business.


A company's return on equity can be found in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), which you can access via the Research section of Investors.com. It also appears in the [IBD 50 list](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/); the annual ROE and other additional data show up when you download the list into a spreadsheet file (see the "Export" link at the bottom of the list.)


ROE, along with profit margins and sales growth, is a component of the SMR Rating, which is one of the five proprietary IBD ratings used to identify leading stocks.


The SMR Rating is on a scale of A to E, with A indicating that a stock is in the top 20% of all publicly traded companies.



Nevertheless, it's important to keep in mind that companies can show misleading ROE figures by, for example, borrowing more money, which increases liabilities. In this case, net assets are divided by a smaller shareholders' equity, yielding a higher ROE.


That's why it's best to look at a company's ROE over several years or more to get a feel for the long-term trend.


Also, companies that have high ROEs and low debt-to-equity ratios are usually doing a better job of boosting their return on invested capital.

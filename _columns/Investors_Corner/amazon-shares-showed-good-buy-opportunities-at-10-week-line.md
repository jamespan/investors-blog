[Patterns To Market Wealth:](http://news.investors.com/special-report/627625-patterns-to-market-wealth.aspx) Ninth In A Series


One way to build wealth in a portfolio is to add to an already successful position.


Yet, you have to do this at the right time. Add to the position too late and you could be buying just before a decline.


How do you know it's too late?


Research shows that the first or second trip to the 10-week line (or 50-day moving average) can be an opportunity to add shares. On the third trip or later, success is less likely.


Additional factors have to be considered when a stock comes to the line for the first or second time after a breakout: The market should be in a confirmed uptrend. The stock should have strong fundamentals. The industry group should be strong or have other leaders in it. Volume on the decline to the line should be quiet. Volume on the bounce off the line should be strong.


Some investors become frustrated by all these conditions. They're convinced that they will never find anything to buy if they observe all these rules.


In a way, they are right. Most stocks aren't worth buying. And the rules are designed to keep you out of those stocks. The goal is to find an elite performer and build a concentrated position.


Patience and self-control are crucial to success. You must be willing to dismiss the low-probability situations that work. The fact that somebody wins a state lottery doesn't change the fact that the odds are terrible. The fact that a junky stock sometimes soars in a down market is not a reason to buy junky stocks in a down market.


You want the probabilities on your side.


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) broke out of a base at 25.10 on the March 17, 2003, follow-through day **1** and rose 12% before retreating in declining volume. The stock found support at its 10-week moving average and bounced off the line in late April. **2** This set a buy zone.


Amazon rose over the next 12 weeks, then returned to its 10-week line a second time. The stock bounced off the line **3** but then sputtered, nearly revisiting the line again. Although the second trip eventually worked, the market was in correction and a disciplined investor would not have added shares.


The stock then returned to the line a third time but could not bounce off it. **4**

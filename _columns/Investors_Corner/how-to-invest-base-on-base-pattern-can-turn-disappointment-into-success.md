Sometimes a stock jumps past a buy point, but it breaks expectations by going sideways soon after. Yet in some situations this can be bullish, and it offers a lesson on how to invest.

A good growth stock will climb 20% to 30% or even more from a proper base. When it doesn't, it may go on to form another base. Often, this happens because [the stock market is weak](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ibds-market-outlook-a-guide-to-the-different-designations/), limiting the stock's progress.

When the second base forms just on top of the earlier pattern, that's good chart action. IBD founder William O'Neil called this pattern a base on top of a base. Today, the pattern is better known for its shorter name of "base on base." But the framework remains the same.

"When the bearish phase in the overall market ends, as it always does at some point, this stock is apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain," he wrote in ["How to Make Money in Stocks."](https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Money-Stocks-Winning/dp/0071614133/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=how+to+make+money+in+stocks&qid=1641488240&sprefix=how+to+make%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-1) "It's like a spring that is being held down by the pressure of a heavy object. Once the object (in this case, a bear market) is removed, the spring is free to do what it wanted to do all along."

## How To Invest With Base On Base

The key characteristic is that the second base form entirely or mostly above the first.

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was already well known as an outstanding growth company in 2021, when its advance came to a pause in July.

Normally, a market leader like Nvidia would continue to add gains. But after just a couple of weeks, the stock stopped its progress.

In early September, the stock market peaked in what would become a 6% correction in the S&P 500. With the market weighing, Nvidia consolidated for about six weeks **(2)**. This base dipped slightly below the top of the prior one, meeting the requirement for a base-on-base formation.

## How To Invest: Nvidia's Surge

Its 15% decline in this period was roughly three times more than the S&P's drop, and it could be interpreted as a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/).

The designer of chips for PC graphics, video game consoles, self-driving vehicles and other emerging technologies topped the 230.53 buy point on Oct. 25 **(3)**, and the next day rallied 6.7%. Why? A massive capital spending boost from **Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) was expected to benefit Nvidia because much of it was aimed at data-center technology.

Nvidia shares continued surging, climbing 40% by Nov. 9. The stock eventually peaked at 346.47 on Nov. 22, leaving investors with enough gains to absorb a new consolidation that started at that point.

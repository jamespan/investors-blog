To find your edge in the market, IBD offers several premium products. From [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) to [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), from MarketDiem to [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge), investors have powerful tools for how to invest. But choice paralysis is a very real phenomenon. If you're unsure how to begin your first excursion in the stock market, check out the [IBD Stock Screener](https://ibdstockscreener.investors.com/).

Inside IBD Stock Screener, you can find IBD's top lists, including the IBD 50, Big Cap 20, and Sector Leaders. These are the lists that lead the charge to find market winners, oftentimes before they start a huge run.

The screener also includes lists of Stocks Funds Are Buying, stocks with Rising Profit Estimates, Global Leaders and stocks with Relative Strength At New Highs.

If you're new to the investing game, a single list of 50 companies, most of which may be completely new to you, might already feel like an overload, never mind several lists. But that's what our stock screener was made for. Adding even a single filter can cut any list down to the best of the best. Even veteran investors will find useful research tools.

## How To Invest: Setting Up A Screen

Begin by expanding the Screener tab on the left side of the page and clicking on Add Screen. Here you can set minimum and maximum parameters for criteria such as share price, average volume or any of IBD's SmartSelect Ratings. Unfamiliar this those? Hover over the question marks for a brief explanation of what each rating means.

For illustrative purposes, setting your minimum for Composite Rating to 99 for the IBD 50 on Wednesday narrowed the list to 11 names. That's more manageable!

Once you get more familiar with each rating, you can tailor your screens however you'd like for a streamlined experience.

During weak markets, some stocks of lower quality can start appearing on our screens. The Screener's filters can help you keep screens at a high quality and be more knowledgeable on how to invest.

Find the IBD Stock Screener by going to the homepage of Investors.com, and it will be under the Research category of the main navigation bar.

You can also apply the screens you create to your own custom lists. The last list on the Screener menu is IBD Data Tables. This gives you access to the entire IBD database, and you can filter it as you wish.

If you have already created a list in My Stock List, you can open it with the Stock Screener. Without having to switch views, you can see Price & Volume and SmartSelect Ratings at the same time in one tidy list.

## Using Charts, Checklists, Articles

Click on ticker and dive deeper into how to invest in the names on your lists with these features:

- The right column has compact charts with a brief analysis of the stock from IBD's market writers. Choose among weekly, daily, and intraday charts.
- IBD grades each stock with Pass, Fail or Neutral on six ratings. Select "More" for an even deeper analysis that includes 25-plus technical and fundamental pieces of data.
- Follow our coverage with links to the three most recent IBD articles on the company. Keep in mind that some stories make only brief mentions of the company.
- You can download all lists onto Excel spreadsheets. Look for the "Export" link.
- Click the three dots at the left of each stock to view stock quotes and MarketSurge or IBD Leaderboard charts, if you get those services.

IBD stock screener is included in your digital subscription to Investors.com.

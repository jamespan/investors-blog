  A Savvy Investor Must Recognize Market Corrections

The average annual return on large-cap stocks over the past 76 years is 9.8%, according to stock market tracker Ibbotson. That return is difficult to match with any other asset class.


But that statistic masks a very important point. Stocks don't rise in a nice, smooth fashion that induces a good night's sleep. They go up in fits and starts, driven largely by emotions of fear and greed. The market has what has come to be known as corrections.


Novice investors sometimes don't understand that corrections are a natural part of the stock market. They learn the hard way.


A serious correction will knock your portfolio for a loop. Sometimes even young professional money managers don't understand that. During the late 1990s, fortunes were made in the Internet boom, only to be lost when the bubble burst. It happened again in the financial crisis of 2008. And it will happen again.


Corrections can be minor, taking down the general market indexes no more than 8% to 12% and lasting only a few weeks before the uptrend resumes. Or they can be huge. In the 2008 bear, the S&P 500 fell 58%.


A correction of 20% or more is considered a bear market. A surge in distribution days always precedes such steep market declines. (See Tuesday's [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/681292-what-is-distribution-in-the-stock-market.htm?ref=HPLNews) for more on the distribution day concept.)


Between 1955 and 2009, there were 71 bear markets and intermediate corrections (generally an 8% to 12% decline). They are the reason buy-and-hold investing doesn't work consistently, a lesson that has been driven home during the volatile times of the past 13 years.


It is exceedingly rare that a leading stock in one bull market will be a leader in the next. That's why an important part of an investor's strategy should be to sell before the decline begins and remain in cash until the next uptrend begins. A new group of leaders will emerge, and that's where your money should be.


Contrary to what many commentators say, recognizing market tops and bottoms is possible. It requires a diligent study of the price-and-volume action of the indexes and of leading stocks.


This is where IBD can help. Each day, [The Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) shines a light on the previous day's market. And the accompanying Market Pulse table highlights the market direction. Is it in a confirmed uptrend? Is the uptrend under pressure? Or is the market in a correction?

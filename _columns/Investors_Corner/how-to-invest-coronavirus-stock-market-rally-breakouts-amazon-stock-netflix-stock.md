After an early April [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), equity investors faced the question of how to invest in top stocks. And just as important, how aggressive to be in the wake of the coronavirus stock market crash.




Buying On A Follow-Through Day And Beyond
-----------------------------------------


[The follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) essentially tells investors when to start buying quality stocks again, as they break out past [buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). In the more than five decades since he began tracking this signal, [IBD founder William J. O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/) says he's never seen a bull market that didn't begin with a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-follow-through-day-sparked-a-market-bottom-one-century-ago/).


Another key aspect of investing is buying on a follow-through day, if possible, to help get your portfolio and mindset in sync with the stock market action. On April 2, the S&P 500 staged a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), signifying the start of a new potential uptrend, according to that day's [IBD Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/). But buying opportunities were scant.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ICbreakouts042020-300x120.jpg)On the following Monday, April 6, the Nasdaq composite [created its own bullish signal](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-multiple-positive-signals-but-short-one-ingredient/). Top biotech stock **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) broke out past a 249.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) on that day, rising more than 7% in heavy turnover. As of Thursday's trade, Vertex stock is more than 5% past the buy point, so it's [just out of buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/).


Remember, don't panic if you miss the first couple breakout stocks. The Nasdaq composite is still 13% off its all-time high of 9838. If this stock market rally is real, then there will be plenty of time to buy stocks and make money over the coming weeks.


How To Invest In Breakout Stocks: Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia
--------------------------------------------------------------------



This week, a number of high-profile growth stocks broke out past [potential buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in strong volume, indicating the current stock market rally could have further potential. FANG stocks **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), Dow Jones leader **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and graphics-chip maker **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) all notched breakouts this week.


E-commerce giant Amazon.com advanced 5.3% Tuesday to [break out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) past a [new buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). According to [MarketSmith chart analysis,](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) Amazon stock topped a 2,186.05 buy point in a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/).



Fellow FANG stock Netflix rallied 7% Monday, breaking out past a 383.11 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/). The [5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) ran up to 402.27.


Netflix is an IBD [SwingTrader stock idea](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) and is also on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) Leaders list. According to Leaderboard commentary, "The stock has emerged as a coronavirus play in the age of social distancing."


Microsoft stock broke out above a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-a-double-bottom-base/) with a 175.10 buy point on Thursday with a nearly 3% advance. [The 5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) goes up to 183.86, so the stock is squarely in buy range.


Graphics-chip maker Nvidia reclaimed a 275.50 buy point in a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) after last week's breakout attempt and has now gotten extended. [The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) tops out at 289.28.


Potential Breakouts To Watch: AMD, Apple
----------------------------------------


Meanwhile, other top names continue to form new bases and offer new buy points in the continuing stock market rally, including chip leader **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and [Dow Jones leader](https://www.investors.com/research/dow-jones-stocks/) **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).



AMD stock is rapidly approaching a 59.37 [standard buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [deep cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) after this week's sharp rally. The chip leader was a big winner in late 2019 and early 2020, ahead of the coronavirus stock market crash.


Apple stock regained its key 50-day line this week, as it continues to move up the right side of a cup base. For the time being, the iPhone maker has a 327.95 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Be on the lookout for a [potential handle to form](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/), offering a more risk-optimal buy point.


With the stock market uptrend still in its potential early stages, be patient and disciplined buying breakout stocks. Don't plunge in even if you feel you're missing on big gains; there will be plenty of time to make money, as top stocks continue to build strength and recover from the coronavirus stock market crash.

  Three-Weeks-Tight Pattern Gives New Life To Hot Stock

Miss out on a stock that broke out of its base and climbed out of buying range, or wishing you had bought more? Don't chase it — you may soon get another chance. Leading stocks sometimes rush above their buy points and go into a holding pattern for a few weeks or more.


A three-weeks-tight pattern, in which the second and third weekly price close is no more than 1% to 1.5% away from the prior week's close, gives investors a chance to buy a small number of shares. The buy point is found by adding 10 cents to the highest price in the pattern.


Three-weeks-tight patterns form in between a stock's [bases](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/739816-what-makes-a-great-stock-base.htm). A stock should clear its base buy point in heavy volume because that's a sign that institutional investors are piling in to push the stock higher.


But turnover should cool off as the stock forms the three-weeks-tight pattern. The reason: It's a sign that those big funds are holding onto their shares — and maybe even picking some up — as smaller holders take profits.


**Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) started shaping a three-weeks-tight pattern with a buy point at 46.47 in the week ended March 8, 2013. Price changes in the following two weeks were down 0.6% and up 0.8%. Volume during the tight phase was about average.


The pattern formed after Gilead broke out above a 35.25 flat-base buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in late January 2013) in heavy volume during the week ended Nov. 16, 2012. It then rallied 32%.


Ideally, you'd like the pattern to form before a stock has risen 20% to 25% above its buy point, as most stocks correct at that point to form new bases.


However, Gilead was still showing characteristics of a true leader. The market was in a confirmed uptrend and the stock had risen for 10 straight weeks in leading up to the three-weeks-tight pattern.


Furthermore, Gilead had a 98 Composite Rating, a tick below the best-possible 99, which put it at the top of the highly ranked biotech industry. Also, its [SMR Rating](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/705993-basics-of-the-ibd-smr-rating.htm) — sales, profit margin and return on equity — was a top-notch A.


Gilead removed any doubt about its ability to rise further when it jumped above the 46.47 three-weeks-tight buy point on March 27, hitting a new high in volume that was 94% above average.


In less than two months, it rose 25% from the three-weeks-tight entry to a fresh peak of 58.07 — a good time to take profits. Gilead then corrected to form a new base.


Investors can use the three-weeks-tight pattern to add shares to an existing position or start a new position. In either case, buy only a small amount of shares when a stock clears a three-weeks-tight pattern — maybe 5% of a full-size position.


That smaller purchase helps minimize risk, as the pattern forms after the stock has already risen beyond the 5% limit that defines a buy area from a base.


Since three-weeks-tight patterns represent pauses within a stock's strong uptrend, avoid follow-on patterns that form on stocks that typically don't move very much, such as lumbering [big cap stocks](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-big-cap-20.htm). Some slow-moving big caps don't usually show strong prior uptrends. They also trade tightly week to week.

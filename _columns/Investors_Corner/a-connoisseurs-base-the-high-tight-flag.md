Four-leaf clovers, triple plays in baseball, triple-crown winners in horse racing. All are rare. The second two indicate a powerful combination of winning elements. And a four-leaf clover is just darned good luck.

  

A stock forming a high, tight flag pattern combines those strengths. It suggests a winning stock, poised to seize unusual gains.

  

A high, tight flag starts with a flagpole: a 100% or more run-up in four to eight weeks. It shapes a flag with a discreet pullback, typically 10% to 20% in three to five weeks.

  

It is a high-risk pattern â€” a stock that has already soared 100% or more can be packed full of investors set to take gains. That's why you must make sure to wait for shares to pass the buy point, a dime above the left-side high, in better than 40% trade.

  

According to research, stocks with solid fundamentals that form this very rare pattern often move on to substantial additional gains.

  

High, tight flags occur most often in small, thinly traded stocks. They tell you some change has occurred in a company's markets or products. The market is scrambling to recalculate the stock's value. The volatility of such stocks increases the risk factor.

  

But stocks as diverse as **Taser** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) and **Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) have all formed successful high, tight flags.

  

On the other hand, **JDS Uniphase** ([JDSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JDSU)) and **Jinko Solar** ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) both recently set up what appeared to be high, tight flags, then crumbled.

  

Maybe the most tragic example was China-based **American Dairy** ([ADY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADY)), which shaped a beautiful pattern in June 2009. The stock stopped a penny short of the flag's left-side high, then plunged 33%.

  

Don't confuse a high, tight flag with a climax run. High, tight flags tend to occur early in a stock's run. Climax activity can appear similar, but it occurs 18 weeks or more from an initial breakout.

  

The classic example of a high, tight flag is Syntex, a Panama-based drugmaker that went public in 1962. The company was the second U.S. drugmaker to receive federal approval to market an oral contraceptive, two years behind GD Searle.

  

The general market was just rising out of a correction that bottomed with the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962. Syntex broke out of cup-with-handle base in February 1963.

  

The stock screamed 136% in 19 weeks. The last eight weeks produced gains of 108%, setting the flagpole for the high, tight flag **1**.

  

The stock eased 19.5% over the next five weeks **2**. That's too deep for a flat base, too short to be a cup. But the big prior run-up combined with the short consolidation qualified as a high, tight flag pattern.

  

The stock cleared the 98.35 buy point in late July **3**. It scorched a gain of nearly 500% before topping dramatically in January 1964.

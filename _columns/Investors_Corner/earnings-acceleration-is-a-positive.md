With earnings season in full swing, it's confession time for many companies. Investors should pay attention to those firms with strong growth. But acceleration is also a good thing to see.

  

A couple of firms in this week's Big Cap 20 have already unveiled quarterly earnings and/or sales that have grown from prior quarters.

  

Acceleration is a good thing to see. It tells you that business is not only good, but things are picking up steam, too. In a study of past market winners, almost every one of them showed accelerating profit growth sometime in the past 10 quarters before taking off.

  

**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) is in a solid uptrend and trading just off an all-time high. The stock broke out from a cup base in January.

  

In late February, the home improvement giant reported a 34% jump in fourth-quarter earnings, marking the second straight period of accelerating growth. Its top-line growth also picked up. Sales grew at a 14% clip, up from 2% and 5% in the prior two periods. The 14% gain was its best performance in years.

  

The retailer is reaping the benefits of a rebound in the housing and construction markets. Home Depot reports first-quarter results May 21.

  

Supermarket stocks are generally not known to be strong performers, but **Kroger** ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) has been on a rampage since breaking out from a flat base in January. It has rallied almost 30% before easing. The stock has yet to test its 10-week line.

  

Big-box supermarkets have heavy competition and sell low-margin products. Both factors usually weigh on earnings, but Kroger, the nation's biggest grocery chain, is seeing robust results. Retail giant **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) are also selling groceries now, thus giving traditional supermarkets even more competition.

  

Last month Kroger, the operator of Ralph's, Food 4 Less, Smith's, and its namesake stores, smashed expectations with Q4 earnings that surged 76% to 88 cents a share. This was its best result in years and marked the second straight quarter of acceleration.

  

Kroger's sales jumped 13% to more than \$24 billion â€” also the second straight period of acceleration.

  

"Kroger's unique value offering of better service, great products and an enjoyable shopping experience with low prices continues to resonate with a full range of customers," said Chairman and CEO David Dillon in a press release.

  

Cleaning and sanitation products supplier **Ecolab** ([ECL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ECL)) has posted accelerating earnings growth for the past three quarters. Top-line growth has surged recently, thanks to its buyout of water-treatment company Nalco.

  

Ecolab is extended from a rebound off its 10-week moving average. The stock broke out from a flat base in February.

  

The company reports earnings Tuesday before the market's open.

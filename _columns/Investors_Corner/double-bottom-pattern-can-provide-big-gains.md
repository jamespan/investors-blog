While the cup with handle is the most common stock chart pattern among great winners, the double bottom also pops up frequently â€” and has a similar look.

It initially resembles a cup with handle, but then the handle slants way, way down. So far down that it no longer is a proper handle, and the overall structure instead takes on a W-like shape.

The second part of the W actually undercuts the first. Look at the double-bottom base that **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) formed in 2010 **1**, as shown in the chart accompanying this column.

In early August 2010 **2**, it might have appeared as though Ulta was en route to etching a cup with handle. But the specialty retailer of cosmetics, beauty products and hair salon services made another move down, touching a fresh six-month low at 20.67 on Sept. 1, 2010.

So when do double bottoms generally occur?

As with any base, they often begin to take shape when the general market itself experiences an intermediate correction.

You frequently get the second half of the pattern for a leading stock when the market tries to rally, then falls back into correction mode.

That's exactly what happened with Ulta. The market was in an uptrend from early July through early August, as noted at that time in IBD's The Big Picture column and Market Pulse graphic.

But the uptrend came under pressure in mid-August, and then the market fell into a brief correction in late August. Ulta etched the second half of its double-bottom structure during this period.

The next confirmed uptrend began with a follow-through day on Sept. 1, 2010. This turned into a strong uptrend that helped unleash plenty of big advances by highly rated stocks, including Ulta.

Ulta broke out on Sept. 3, a couple of sessions after the follow-through day. It cleared a buy point at 25.99. With any double bottom, the entry comes from the middle peak in the W-like pattern.

For Ulta, the middle peak was at 25.89, so you just add a dime to get the buy point at 25.99.

The breakout on Sept. 3 drew strong turnover **3** , just like you want to see. On a weekly basis, turnover was the strongest it had ever been for Ulta, which went public in 2007.

For individual investors who like to sell stocks short in bad markets, the head-and-shoulders pattern often provides a reliable entry. IBD founder William J. O'Neil observed in "How to Make Money in Stocks" that when identifying a top in a stock, "head-and-shoulders patterns are among the most reliable."


Yet problems sometimes occur in interpretation.


"If you have only a little knowledge of charts, you can misinterpret what is a correct head-and-shoulders top," O'Neil added. "Many pros don't interpret the pattern properly. The right (second) shoulder must be slightly below the left shoulder."


**Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) debuted on the stock market in mid-1999, just in time to ride a technology stock melt-up.


A melt-up is a type of stock run-up that usually involves panic buying among investors who are afraid they are missing out on something big. It may occur without any stepped-up earnings to back up the euphoria. This is what happened in 1999-2000, when the market was an expanding balloon headed for a pop.


In the quarter ended June 1999, Juniper reported an operating loss of \$4.2 million vs. a loss of \$7.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company was losing less money, which was progress but not ideal. Juniper would continue to lose money until the first quarter of 2000, the same time that the Nasdaq peaked, then sold off sharply.


From a high in March 2000, Juniper dropped 55% in two months.


Yet by this time Juniper was increasingly profitable. The company was on track to post a net profit of \$147.9 million in 2000, enough to erase the net losses of the previous four years combined.


The stock regrouped and thrust 249% higher from a May low to October.


During the run-up, disciplined investors probably would've sold the stock for a triple-digit percentage gain at one of the dips below the 50-day line, especially if their original entry was October 1999, the first breakout at a 39.16 buy point.


The right time to sell, though, isn't the right time to short a stock. It would be rare for those two situations to converge.


As IBD observes in its "Short Selling Home Study Program": "If an investor sells a stock on the way up — the proper strategy — the stock may often have further to rise. Shorting at that juncture could prove painful."


So when did the stock establish itself as a short? Juniper completed a head-and-shoulders pattern in December 2000.


The left shoulder peaked at 181.25 **(1)**. The right shoulder's high point was 168.50 **(2)**. Note that the right shoulder was below the left shoulder, as it should be in a proper head-and-shoulders pattern.


The low of the left shoulder was 118.06. Although the right shoulder dipped below that low several times, it was the wrong time to short — too obvious.


The first correct short sale came around 114, when the stock regained and dived under the 10-week line.


Another correct short sale occurred around 50 **(3)** after the stock regained the 10-week line, then broke under it.

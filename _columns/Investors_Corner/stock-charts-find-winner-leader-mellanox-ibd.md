[2013: A Look Back And Ahead](http://news.investors.com/special-report/638663-2013-a-look-back-and-ahead.aspx)

Whether you've been reading IBD for 10 months or 10 years, you can always benefit from a simple chart-reading exercise. It will help you judge how a leading stock is acting.

What is this exercise?

Take a weekly chart that shows the price and volume changes. Charts on Investors.com or MarketSmith (an IBD sister firm) make this mental workout easier: Up weeks and their corresponding volume bars are painted blue, down weeks in red.

As you analyze a leader that may be forming a base — or at least pausing for air after making a strong move — study how the stock's price changes from week to week as well as how the volume changes .

If the stock is rising in price, ask yourself: Is volume rising too?

If yes, think this: "Institutions are coveting shares. That's good."

If the stock is falling, ask: "Is volume cooling off?"

If yes, think this: "Selling pressure is low. That's also good."

Also pay attention to weekly volume with respect to its 10-week moving average. If you see numerous weekly price declines but the volume bars stand underneath the moving-average line, think this: "Ah ha. This is evidence that the deep pockets really don't want to sell their shares. That's good."

**Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)) was a big flameout in the fourth quarter. Yet its run-up deserves an analysis.

The data networking technology firm roared 49.5% in the week ended April 20 **(1**) on a superb quarterly report (EPS rose 113%, revenue 61%). That yanked the stock 64% past a 37.53 buy point.

Such a big move doesn't mean you quit watching and move on.

The next week, Mellanox fell 6% in heavy trade, **(2)** but it was sharply less than the prior week's huge volume. It was a reasonable pullback. Keep watching.

The next week, down 3%, saw even lighter volume. **(3)** Good.

Look at the two other weekly declines. Volume fell and was also well below average **(4)**

The chance to get in? The week ended June 8, as Mellanox successfully closed above 60 for the first time in seven weeks. **(5)** Volume grew. The stock doubled in 14 weeks. A breakout from a cup base occurred in June, too.

A pullback to the 10-week line gave one more buy opportunity. **(6)**

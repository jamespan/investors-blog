  How To Invest: What Does A Flawed Handle Look Like?

in the realm of smart chart reading, handles commonly latch on to cup bases. They can also be found on double bottoms or saucer bases. Either way, they offer investors a prime buy point within a well-formed base.


Why do handles matter? They visually represent the last transfer of shares from long-suffering holders eager to exit a stock to the sturdier hands of professionals with conviction. A handle marks the final mild shakeout before a stock prepares an outstanding breakout, a run of new highs, and the potential for dedicated growth investors to increase their wealth.


But before deciding to buy a stock that is breaking out, make sure you spend enough time to recognize the good handles from the bad ones.


Please use this handy-dandy check list to help you spot the flaws and avoid potential stock-market traps.


**The upward-wedging handle**. A handle is simply a mild quantified pullback. It should drift lower along the price lows of the handle, setting up the next potential leg up. The lows in a wedging handle, however, angle upward — a flaw because it doesn't show a shakeout of the last remaining weak holders. Wedging handles tend to form on third- or fourth-stage bases.


**The short handle**. Handles need to be at least five days in length. Anything less is too short. Some take weeks or longer to form. Blood donation handling systems firm **Haemonetics** ([HAE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAE)) cleared a 61.17 buy point from a four-day handle on Feb. 2, 2009. But after a big breakout day, the stock quickly fizzled.


**The low handle**. A handle should form in the upper half of the stock's base. It's also generally best if it begins forming no more than 15% off the high of the pattern.


**Use the midpoint test**. This simple calculation is performed to see if the handle has formed in the upper half. First, add the high and low of the base, then divide by 2. That gives you the midpoint of the base. Then calculate the midpoint of the handle. The latter should be greater than the first. The formation of a low handle tells you the stock hasn't been strong enough to recover the bulk of its prior losses.


**The deep handle**. Generally, a handle should correct no more than 8% to 12% during a normal up cycle in the market. When stocks are nearing the bottom of a bear-market-type decline, handles can correct 20% to 30% and the breakout can still be OK — so as long as the market soon stages a follow-through signal and the stock is top-notch in fundamentals, technical strength, and institutional sponsorship. In essence, such a stock should have all the characteristics of a true CAN SLIM growth name.


**Ctrip.com International** ([CTRP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTRP)) cleared a 63.10 buy point from a deep handle on May 1, 2008. The stock's handle corrected 23% while the market was in a confirmed rally. Ctrip imploded after gaining 12%.


**High volume in handle**. It's best to see a handle formed mostly in below-average volume. Yes, you can allow a day or two of heavy volume within the handle; such a shakeout in fact can be healthy. Yet overall the pullback should show only a few remaining uncommitted investors quietly taking money off the table, not institutions dumping stock.


![ic_tsl_chart_012417](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IC_tsl_Chart_012417-916x1024.png)Back in January 1991, software giant **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) bolted out from a cup-with-handle base. The stock's handle was four weeks in length. All weeks occurred in very low volume, suggesting that professionals were holding on to their shares.


Microsoft more than doubled in 12 months and went on to become one of the greatest stocks in the 1990s.


It's possible for a stock to show more than one flaw within its handle. Even if the company has proved itself a winner, keep in mind that the current base gives the most important clues to whether or not a future breakout will have a good chance of success.


**Trina Solar** ([TSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSL)) debuted on the NYSE at 9.30 on Dec. 19, 2006, and surged above 18 by late February the next year. The company makes photovoltaic cells for solar power equipment.


Solar stocks have proved to be volatile, and Trina was no exception. After hitting a peak of 68.90 in April 2007, shares corrected 44% in less than eight weeks.


Buyers rolled in, and the stock quickly formed a cup without handle. In July, Trina hit a new high, but quickly dropped hard again **(1)**, coming within 4 cents of the low of the prior base.


By late October, it had formed a cup-with-handle base with a 64.60 buy point. But this pattern was flawed too. Why?


The stock's handle was 26% deep **(2)** and formed in some heavy volume **(3)** — two critical flaws.


Before its breakout, Trina had solid IBD Ratings: Composite 97, Earnings Per Share 82, Relative Strength 96 and Accumulation/Distribution B-.


But when the stock cleared the handle Nov. 6, its rally failed two days later.


Trina fell 50% by Nov. 21 **(4)** as the broader market weakened fast.

After last week's follow-through day, equity and ETF investors face the question of how to get back into stocks. And just as important, how aggressive to be in the wake of the coronavirus stock market crash.




On April 2, the S&P 500 staged a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/), signifying the start of a new potential uptrend, according to that day's [IBD Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-jumps-sp500-bullish-action-comes-with-caveats/). The S&P 500 rallied 2.3% in higher volume than the previous session. On Monday April 6, the Nasdaq composite [created its own bullish signal](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-makes-multiple-positive-signals-but-short-one-ingredient/).


The Follow-Through After A 'Vertical Violation'
-----------------------------------------------


The follow-through essentially tells investors when to start buying quality stocks again, as they break out past buy points. In the more than five decades since he began tracking this signal, IBD founder William J. O'Neil says he's never seen a bull market that didn't begin with a follow-through.


However, not every follow-through day is successful, especially after vertical violations — severe price breaks below the indexes' 50-day or 200-day moving averages. On Feb. 25, the [IBD Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/apple-leaders-crushed-as-stock-market-issues-its-first-bearish-break-of-2020/) moved the stock outlook into a "market in correction" with this comment: "A sharp decline of at least 3% in at least one of the recent sessions, plus a stab below the 50-day moving average help define the vertical violation."


After severe breaks of the market, follow-throughs have a tendency to fail. For example, in the fourth-quarter bear market of 2018, there were two failed follow-throughs — Nov. 7 and Nov. 28 — before a third try on Jan. 4, 2019 was successful.


Coronavirus Stock Market ETF Investor Strategy
----------------------------------------------


For [stock market ETF investors](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/), the normal action to take after a follow-through is to raise exposure in index funds such as the Nasdaq 100-linked **Invesco QQQ Trust ETF** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) from 0% to 100%. However, given the stock market crash, ETF investors should wade into the market more cautiously.


The downside reversal day on April 7 underscores the volatility in the current stock market rally. The Nasdaq gained as much as 2.9% before closing with a 0.2% decline. According to [Tuesday's The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stocks-today-let-big-early-gains-wither-what-nasdaq-sp500-should-avoid-now/), "Volume rose mildly on both major exchanges. Thus, the Nasdaq got tagged with the first [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) of the current new rally since the stock market's important session on Thursday."


But on Wednesday, the [stock market powered higher](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rally-continues-coronavirus-optimism-amd-amazon-microsoft/) on rising coronavirus optimism. Despite the strong action in indexes, breakouts among the top stocks continue to fall short.


Instead, ETF investors could start raising exposure to perhaps 25%. Then they could steadily increase exposure as the major stock indexes continue to improve. One bullish signal is when the lows of the Nasdaq are above the 21-day exponential moving average. Another sign of strength is when the 21-day exponential moving average starts trending above a rising 50-day moving average line. (The 21-day exponential moving average can be found on [MarketSmith charts](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith).)


Other positive signals to bump up your exposure include an increasing number of breakouts past proper buy points among the stock market's top growth stocks, such as FANG stocks **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Amazon and Netflix are both [exhibiting strong relative strength](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-watch-coronavirus-stock-market-correction-amazon-stock-netflix-stock/) as they try to form new bases.


Amazon stock continues to move up the right side of a new cup base with a 2186.05 buy point, and shares are back above their 50-day line.


Meanwhile, Netflix displays a 393.62 buy point. The stock rebounded from its 50-day line Monday.


So far, there have been very few breakouts, and stocks need more time to recover from their sharp sell-offs. Notably, **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) [broke out above a new buy point](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-watch-stock-market-rally-amazon-stock-netflix-stock-vertex-stock/) Monday amid a 7% gain. Shares are just below the proper entry after Wednesday's near-1% gain.


During stock market corrections, equity investors should have been building a [watchlist of top stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-correction-put-to-use-build-a-watchlist/) in preparation for a [potential follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-how-to-spot-a-stock-market-bottom/). To help you build that watchlist, study the IBD 50 and other IBD screens. Also check [IBD Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/), which focuses on companies with historically stable earnings growth and price performance. You can also check out the [IBD Live Watch List](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A) for more stock ideas.


With a stock market back in a confirmed uptrend, it's time to put that watchlist to good use.

If you want to make money in stocks this year, it's not too late to first take a few steps back before you go forward. Take some serious time out to review your past trades.

You could dramatically improve the results of your portfolio performance going forward.

It's always fun to see how your good investments worked out. But looking back also lets you see how and why the bad trades emerged. A sober analysis will give you a leg up for the rest of 2018. If you learn how you made your mistakes, you can write a rule about them and vow to always follow it. This disciplined approach will help you avoid making the mistakes again.

## Step 1: Discover Your Biggest Investing Errors

First, print out charts of your disappointing trades. Mark the day or week when you bought shares and when you sold.

Print a chart of the Nasdaq or the S&P 500, and [study the market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) in which you made the trades. Did you tend to buy when the market was falling or flat-lining? Were breakouts from [proper buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) fizzling fast? If yes, then write down this rule: I will deploy cash only when IBD's Market Pulse outlook states "confirmed uptrend."

Your chances of catching a rising stock are now instantly greater.

Note the price and volume of the stocks you buy. Do you home in on [cheap shares priced in the single digits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-why-most-penny-stocks-fail-to-make-investors-rich/)? If so, you might want to write a rule in which you focus only on those that trade for at least 15 a share. Also, focus on those with an average dollar volume of \$25 million to \$50 million or more. Institutions — the main drivers of big stock winners — tend to favor higher priced stocks with ample volume.

Such a rule would likely have steered you toward big-cap winners such as **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), which on April 21, 2017, cleared a 43.90 entry in a long cup with handle in active turnover, 45% above its 50-day average. At that time, the digital payments firm traded 5.52 million shares on average over the prior 50 sessions. So the average dollar volume was a hefty \$240 million per day.

## Step 2: Learn New Sell Rules

When the market is in the late stages of a bull run, it's sensible to take gains quickly. Instead of waiting for each stock winner to rise 20% or 25% from the proper buy point, start taking gains at 10% to 15%.

Avoid round-trips in good stocks. Don't let a [gain of more than 10% gain evaporate to zero](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-sell-dont-freeze-if-double-digit-gain-in-a-stock-shrinks-fast/) or become a loss. If you get shaken out of a stock, you can always buy it back when it presents a new buy point.

## Step 3: Review Your Trading History

Study the volatility of the stocks you traded. Do they swing, say, 10% or more from weekly low to high on a regular basis? Such stocks tend to chase people out after rushing to new highs.

Are you trading too much? Take a break from all new buys if the number of losing trades begins to exceed your winning ones.

Also, study your equity curve. Do it by plotting your monthly account balance on a graph. Over time, is your equity rising steadily and holding up well during long periods? That's ideal. But if the graph looks like a string of hairpin curves, you're more prone to taking too many trades that ultimately erase your hard-earned profits.

## Step 4: Check In Daily

One of the most important keys to achieving steady gains and staying in sync with the market is to watch the market every day.

It takes only two minutes at most to check IBD's Market Pulse and scan the [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) so that you know when to be in the market.

If you don't make such a daily habit, your results will likely suffer.

"Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm — to forget to plant in the spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest?" Stephen R. Covey wrote in "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People." "The farm is a natural system. The price must be paid and the process followed. You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut."

For serious IBD readers, post-trade analysis is part of the price that must be paid.

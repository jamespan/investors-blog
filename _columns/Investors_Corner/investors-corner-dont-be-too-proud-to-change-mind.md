Changing your mind is a virtue in the stock market.

For many investors, this is difficult to learn. In American culture, flip-flopping is considered a mark of weakness or confusion. If a company offered you a job, then withdrew the offer a week later, and then offered the job again the next week, would you take the job?

You'd probably conclude the company was run by nut cases.

But stocks behave like that frequently, and the U-turns aren't necessarily a sign that you should avoid the stock.

Sometimes a shift in the market will play havoc with a fundamentally strong stock. The stock will break out (time to buy), trigger the 8% sell rule (time to sell) and then reclaim the 10-week moving average in even stronger volume (time to buy it back).

An investor might feel dizzy as he or she heeds each signal, but feelings can't validate or invalidate an investment strategy.

In "How to Make Money in Stocks," IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil writes on Page 19 about such a case, IBM in 1926. "Very important: After shakeout, if stock comes back up through 10-week line on even greater volume, you must buy it back!"

The buying back shouldn't be less than the original purchase. In fact, some disciplined investors will buy back a few more shares than the number originally purchased. They gain a psychological edge from increasing the position â€” the elimination of regret.

In 1926, **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) shaped a 36-week cup with handle and a 50.60 buy point **1**. The stock broke out in strong volume in September **2**. An investor who bought the stock, though, might have sold the stock as the stock pulled back quickly **3**. Those who bought at say, 52.50 or higher, would have had to sell when the stock triggered the 8% sell rule.

Three weeks later, IBM jumped over its 10-week moving average in fast trade **4**. This was a signal to buy the stock again. IBM rallied about fivefold, peaking with the market in the autumn of 1929.

"A successful investor learns to do what most investors are not willing to do," O'Neil wrote. Few investors "can bring themselves, after selling a stock at a loss, to buy it back higher."

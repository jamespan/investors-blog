A true growth stock investor cannot achieve excellence without executing great sell rules, no matter if a stock is on the way up or on the way down.

If you seek investing greatness, learn this new sell rule that will help you get the most out of new IPOs. It's simply called the eight-week rule, showcased in IBD's newest [home study program](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/ipo-trading-strategies/), "IPO Trading Strategies."

This rule, the product of new IBD research, is simple to follow. You need charts to use it.

Suppose the market is in a confirmed uptrend, and you buy a brand-new stock as it bursts out of its initial base. It rises. A string of up weeks tells you that institutional investors are rushing to grab shares. All good.

Now it's time to apply the eight-week rule. Hold the stock until eight weeks have passed since the breakout day. Then study a weekly stock chart carefully.

Has the stock risen at least 5% to 10%? Does it hold above the 10-week moving average? And is the market still healthy? If the stock passes these tests, continue to hold your shares or sell a portion. Then study the action on a week-to-week basis. Sell only when the stock sharply undercuts its 10-week moving average, typically in above-average volume. And don't ever let the stock's gain turn into a loss.

In November 2006, **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) blasted out of a seven-week initial base at 28.41. That price was 89% above the initial public offering at 15 a share. Its RS line shot to a new high. The Chinese school and test-center operator proved the paradoxical truth that a strong growth stock tends to get stronger.

The IPO base was pristine. It had three down weeks in price; just one week showed heavy volume **(1)**, and it was in fact a support week. New Oriental bounced off its low, signaling a burst of buying by mutual funds, banks and the like.

Eight weeks into the run, New Oriental finished the week at 33.54, up 18%. Ten weeks after the breakout, New Oriental was up 39% past the proper entry. It also reversed lower and closed below the 10-week line **(2)**, but it wasn't a decisive break.

You could have held on.

A true break of the line came in the week ended July 27. New Oriental fell 14% that week; volume exploded 187% above average **(3)**. It was a great time to sell. New Oriental went on to form another base, setting up a new breakout.

You can add the IPO base as the eighth basic chart pattern you must know on top of the cup-with-handle, double-bottom, flat base, saucer, ascending base, the base-on-base, and the high, tight flag.

The IPO Trading Strategies home study program includes two DVDs that integrate audio commentary from Mike Webster, a portfolio manager at IBD sister firm O'Neil Data Systems, with chart annotations.

When you look at an area of price consolidation, it’s always good to ask whether it’s sloppy.

A sloppy base can serve as a red flag.

This column in IBD’s short series on “Why did this breakout fail?” will look at an especially suspect wide-and-loose base — the one formed by Titanium Metals in late 2006 and early 2007.

The pattern began to develop in May 2006, after the stock reached a high of 47.63 following a powerful, multiyear run. The stock split several times during this dramatic advance.

If you missed the ride, you might have thought you would get your chance once the stock caught its breath. But Titanium Metals’ base-building effort looked rather iffy.

In the week ended July 14, 2006, it went from a 2% gain for the week to a loss of 25%, before ending around the middle of its trading range for the week -- down 15% **(1)**.

You prefer to see calmer action, with more moderate price swings, as a base takes shape.

The pattern also was sloppy in showing a deeper-than-ideal correction. Titanium Metals was down 52% from its peak at 47.63 in the week ended Sept. 29, 2006, when it traded as low as 22.77 **(2)**.

Some leading stocks can form bases that correct that much, and then still go on to new highs. But generally, such deep patterns are more prone to failure.

Another problem with the base -- a cup-with-handle structure -- was its noisy handle.

In some weeks as the handle formed, the stock tumbled as turnover increased vs. the prior week **(3)**. You prefer to see volume drying up as the stock pulls back to etch a handle. That signals a final shakeout of some weak investors, rather than a broader rush to the exits.

Titanium Metals ended up providing a possible handle buy point at 38.95. That entry comes from adding a dime to the peak in the stock’s handle **(4)**.

While the stock moved above that level in fast trade on May 11, 2007, the breakout effort quickly flopped. Titanium declined 90% over the next 22 months to as low as 4.04 in March 2009.

The market might forgive some sloppiness in the early stages of a bull market, but in this case it was near the later stages.

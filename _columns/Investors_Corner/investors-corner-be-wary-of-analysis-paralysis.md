*Thirteenth In A Series*

  

Some authors and musicians never break out of the woodshed because they don't know how or when to quit tinkering with their work.

  

Those who do often find what felt like perfectionism was, in reality, procrastination — a way to avoid the risk of commitment.

  

Investors can suffer from a similar condition. They dive deep into research and are never quite satisfied that they know enough. In such a state, it's easy to miss leaders erupting past buy points.

  

There are several ways to get beyond this stage of "analysis paralysis." One is to list and stick to a finite number of requirements, both technical and fundamental, that a stock and a company must meet.

  

These should include the basics for a valid base and buy point. On the fundamentals side, it should begin with EPS and sales growth. IBD's EPS, SMR and Composite ratings reduce the time needed to track down facts.

  

In general, ratings of 90 or higher are preferred. When a stock meets those requirements, the market is in an uptrend and the breakout shows true strength in healthy volume, pull the trigger and go.

  

This doesn't mean cut corners on your research. Try to skim through the most recent 10-K filing so you are aware of the caveats and risks. Read the most salient recent news on the firm, including a New America article. This may take an hour or two. Then draw the line.

  

One stock that toyed with investor confidence earlier this year was **Fossil** ([FOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOSL)). The fashion watch and accessories maker cleared a seven- week flat base in strong trade early in February **1** — a week before reporting Q4 results. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. Plus Fossil had nailed four straight quarters of powerful EPS growth.

  

But risk-averse investors may not have wanted to jump in just ahead of earnings. That logic seemed to pay off when shares pulled back abruptly after its Feb. 15 report **2**. The firm posted a sharp slowdown in EPS growth — often an early sign of fundamental problems. But earnings were still up a healthy 42%. Yes, that was well below the 220% gain posted two quarters earlier, but still well within leadership territory and above the minimum 25% gain dictated by CAN SLIM. Sales growth accelerated to 37%.

  

Over the next two weeks Fossil slipped below the flat-base buy point. But it found firm support at its 10-week moving average **3**. 

  

On March 3, the stock jumped 5% in strong trade. This triggered the "in buying range" signal on a rebound from the 10-week line. Fossil offered a second chance to alert investors who had waited out the earnings report. For those still caught up in researching the details of the earnings slowdown, the stock wouldn't offer another valid buy point until June.

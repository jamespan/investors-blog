Stamina is the ability to sustain performance at or near peak levels. It comes from understanding when to downshift, conserve energy and enable consistent performance over long distances or time periods.

Stocks nearing the end of rallies often show signs of waning stamina.

Like a runner whose pace slackens and whose form erodes, stocks may begin to flash sell signs â€” warnings that they are about to downshift. One prevailing sign is when a stock hits a new high in weak volume.

New highs in weak volume tell you that the stock has little investor conviction and little, if any, institutional support for a continued advance. It can also be a tough signal to read. The moves generally come interspersed with some high-volume gains, and there is a bit of an art to determining what your stock is trying to say.

Fortunately, sell signals rarely happen in isolation. If you see a stock making new highs in weak trade, study the chart for other signs of trouble.

You can't expect strong trade on every uptick. But several instances of the weak volume constitute fair warning, especially if the stock has climbed seven or more days in a row (following a long advance) and is logging wide weekly price spreads, or if it has pierced above its upper channel line.

Commercial real estate leader **CBRE Group** ([CBG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBG)) put the finishing touches on an orderly run-up in April 2011. The stock staged multiple breakouts during 2009 and 2010. The last major breakout cleared a cup-with-handle base in September 2010. Shares posted multiple tests of support at the 50-day moving average in the four months through January.

The stock then vectored higher, pulling away from its 50-day line at just about the same time that the general market began pulling back into a mild consolidation.

At a time like this, if you have a healthy gain in the stock and you don't want it to evaporate, scour the stock's chart for additional sell signs. Is it late-stage? Is it showing wild action or weak rebounds after multiple pullbacks to the 10-week line? Is it flashing [climax top](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/718038-climax-signs-can-mean-end-of-run.htm) behavior? Is it seeing rising volume on down days and/or weeks?

In your search for clues, toggle back and forth between the weekly and daily charts. And watch other leaders in the stock's industry group and sector. If they're under pressure, they amplify any warnings that your stock might be sending.

CBRE was a hard case. It logged just enough strong-volume gains to keep you guessing. On the downside, it saw some selling volume, but it never broke below critical levels of support.

The market did provide some supporting evidence for the sell signals. IBD shifted the market's status to "uptrend under pressure" on Feb. 22, just as CBRE began logging new highs in light trade **(1)**. The market's status slipped into a brief correction on March 8.

After a follow-through launched a new uptrend at the end of the month, all of CBRE's gains came in weak trade **(2)**. You probably still would not have sold at this point. But you would have had fair warning. When volume picked up along with heavy losses near the end of April **(3)**, the time to pull the ripcord was nigh.

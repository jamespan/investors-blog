Whether you're a limo driver or a soccer mom (or dad), you don't think about touching the brakes when you approach a stop sign. You're trained to do it. So you do.

  

Why, then, do we sometimes have trouble pressing the accelerator pedal in our portfolio when the market says "Go"?

  

Our thinking often gets in the way of what we should be doing. Thinking is good, but it ultimately doesn't bring big gains to your portfolio. Taking action at the right time is key.

  

If a major stock average posts a follow-through after a sharp decline, it signals a new uptrend is under way. A true change in market character is critical, since three of four growth stocks track the market's general direction.

  

That's not all. IBD's research has found that the most powerful winners tend to break out to new highs just days or weeks after a solid follow-through takes place.

  

Of course, it can feel scary to begin buying at this point. You might have gotten burned by your last few trades. You might think, well, the news has been so grim, it's not going to get better soon.

  

Yet that's the wicked genius of the market: It moves counter to most people's expectations.

  

William O'Neil confirmed this fact at a recent IBD Meetup gathering in Los Angeles. The IBD founder and chairman asked how many people had read in IBD's Big Picture that the Nasdaq and other indexes posted a follow-through on Sept. 1. Scores of hands shot up.

  

O'Neil then asked how many readers immediately bought stocks.

  

Virtually no one did.

  

Certainly, not every follow-through works. But every major market bottom since 1900 had one. If you wait too long after this key signal, the opportunity costs grow.

  

After moving like a bucking bronco for months, the Nasdaq gained 1.7% on Aug. 27 last year â€” a nice way to begin a new advance **1**. Three days later, a follow-through came as the Nasdaq rose 3% in higher volume **2**. A new bull run was born, and winning stocks began to move.

  

On Sept. 2, **EZchip Semiconductor** ([EZCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EZCH)) surged 6% to new highs. It had pulled back near a breakout point. IBD's Stocks On The Move table highlighted it on Sept. 3. Fertilizer producer **Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) hopped out of a deep cup with handle Oct. 8. It's gained 34%, vs. a 12% advance by the NYSE composite over the same period.

  

Other leaders supplied new entry points. **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) dipped near its 10-week moving average for the first time since its August breakout, then ended the week higher. It sailed ahead 30% in three months and is up 94% from a 234.55 cup-with-handle buy point.

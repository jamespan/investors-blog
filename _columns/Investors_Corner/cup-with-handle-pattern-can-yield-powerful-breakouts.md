New subscribers just learning the CAN SLIM system may wonder where terms such as the cup-with-handle base and cup -without-handle came from.

It's not as esoteric as one might think. Those terms simply refer to the price pattern that takes shape as a stock builds a base before launching a supreme price run â€” giving savvy chart readers a chance to make big profits.

Today's column focuses on the cup-with-handle, which is the most common chart pattern.

Stocks often pull back after hitting a new or 52-week high and form a rounded path as they correct, then make their way back up toward the high. When viewed from the side, these patterns trace the outline of a teacup.

The stock should run up at least 30% before beginning a sound cup base. The depth of decline from the left high to the cup's bottom should be no more than 30% to 35%.

Sometimes the stock will ease again before reaching a high, forming a handle in the process. The handle should drift slightly downward along its lows and correct no more than 8%-12% as volume shrinks. The buy point is the high of the handle, plus 10 cents.

The entire base should be at least seven weeks long and may even continue forming for a year or more. Sound patterns often show calm stock action to produce a smooth shape. Too many wide daily or weekly price swings can create a choppy or jagged pattern. When the stock breaks out past the buy point, look for volume to spike at least 40% to 50% higher than usual.

Always know how the overall market is acting. New buys are riskier when the market is under pressure or in a correction.

**Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) started building a new base in March 2013, soon after emerging from an 18-week cup-with-handle. It fell merely 16% from the left-side high to the base's low of 50.76.

The stock pulled back 11% in the handle. It gapped down 7% on May 8 while forming the handle but ended near the session high in huge trade, a sign of support **(1)**. The buy point was 60.30, a dime above the handle's high.

Jazz reported better-than-expected Q1 results that day and lifted its full-year profit forecast. But investors focused on possible FDA approval of a generic rival to Jazz's Xyrem narcolepsy drug.

Jazz recovered. On May 22, the breakout day, it rose nearly 3% in heavy volume (see a daily chart). It surged 192% to a Feb. 25 high and is now forming a base.

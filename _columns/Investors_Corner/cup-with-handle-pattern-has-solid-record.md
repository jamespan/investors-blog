Waste Management and Storage Technology started big price moves in the late 1970s. Reebok and Compaq Computer did the same in the 1980s.


Show someone a stock chart from prior decades, and the reaction usually goes something like this: "Why would I care about something that happened 30 or 40 years ago?"


When it comes to making money in the stock market, investors generally aren't interested in looking in the rear-view mirror. They're interested in what's actionable now and which stocks have the best potential to deliver big gains down the line. That's understandable, but studying past charts of big winners will ensure you're prepared when emerging leaders today break out from similar patterns.


The reality is that market history is a treasure trove of information. Decade after decade, history repeats itself. Market tops are put in due to repeated signs of institutional selling. Market bottoms are put in when institutional investors start putting money to work. This is when many emerging leaders start big moves after staging strong breakouts from cup-with-handle and other key patterns.


Few knew much about U.K.-based chip designer **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)) when it went public in April 1998. It cleared a first-stage base in June, then went on to form a second-stage cup-with-handle base. It cleared a two-week handle area in December and more than doubled over the next 12 months.


ARM Holdings continues to be a leader in the stock market today. After a shakeout earlier this year, ARM just recently put the finishing touches on a first-stage, cup-with-handle pattern. It cleared a buy point of 48.21 on Sept. 18 but volume was only 16% above average. In other words, there wasn't much conviction behind the buying.


So where's the best place to find cup-with-handle breakouts happening now? There's no shortage of IBD screens, but perhaps the most powerful tool is [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/products/default.aspx), a premium service at Investors.com.

**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

Negative reversals in your portfolio are always disappointing. A rosy start to the day turns into a flaw on the chart and hurts your equity. Such information from a chart is valuable; a cluster of negative reversals often signals more trouble ahead.

In fact, selling powerful stocks after a negative price reversal in big volume can get you out when the odds are no longer in your favor.

Selling at a profit can be one of the toughest parts of trading because of the emotional component. Once your stock gets out of the gate and is showing a decent profit, when do you sell and lock it down?

Locking in a profit may be comforting in the moment, but watching that same stock soar higher without you is painful. Or worse, what if you don't sell and the stock pulls back and erases weeks or months of hard-earned gains?

That doesn't feel good either.

In a negative reversal, a stock moves higher intraday only to retrace the move and close near the lows of the session. On a daily price-and-volume chart this can look like a cluster of "arrows" pointing down. The signal is especially onerous if [volume spikes](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735782&sourceid=735786); big institutions are using strength in the stock as a time to liquidate holdings.

If a stock has run up and is well extended from a basing area, high-volume reversals usually signal at least temporary weakness ahead. The stock may just need time to pause, pull back and test its 10-week moving average, or it could be start of a larger correction.

Without knowing the future, a cluster of daily price reversals is a good time to lock in part or all of your profits before the stock has much of a chance to fall.

How many reversals do you need to see? It depends on the severity of the reversal, the volume expansion and how far extended in price the stock is. You also can spot reversals on weekly charts near the time a stock peaks.

**Precision Castparts** ([PCP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCP)) broke out from a cup-with-handle base in October 2006, trended higher and ran up as much as 150% over the next year. (See page 105 of the fourth edition of "How to Make Money in Stocks" for an annotated weekly chart of the stock's run.) But by the summer of 2007, Precision showed some signs of trouble.

On July 24 the stock hit a new all-time high intraday, but reversed lower in heavy trade. The same thing happened again just eight sessions later **(1)**. Investors who took some money off the table were relieved when the stock plunged below the 50-day line a few sessions later.

Shares did find support and were able to again rally to new highs after some sloppy base-building. Often, stocks that have been big leaders will take time to put in a top as early breaks attract investors who missed the run and are anxious to buy the stock as it pulls back.

Shares staged three more negative reversals in late September and early October **(2)**. Volume was light, but picked up big time as the stock reversed on Oct. 10 **(3)**. From a high of 160.73 on Oct. 5, Precision fell 71% to a low of 47.23 in just one year.

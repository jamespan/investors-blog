  Breakaway Gaps By Stocks Can Be Scary But Profitable

You know the old saying: You can't expect to achieve anything if you don't take risks. This is true in the stock market. Sometimes you do have to stick your neck out somewhat if you want the bigger rewards. You just have to step up and hit the buy button when things look scary at times.


One of these times is when a stock stages a breakaway gap.


[Breakaway gaps](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/advanced-buying-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=APA1BQ8) occur when a stock opens the day powerfully higher than the prior day's close. They often happen after a stock has been rising sharply, peaks in price, and then forms a solid-looking base.


The sharply higher open in a breakaway gap must exceed the highest price in the prior day's trading range. This action leaves a price gap, hence the name. Sometimes, the opening price can be 5% or 10% higher from the prior day's close. In other cases, the breakaway gaps be even larger.


Breakaway gaps signal huge demand.


On Aug. 31, **Medicines** ([MDCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDCO)) staged a huge breakaway gap after announcing positive data on a cholesterol drug with partner **Alnylam Pharmaceuticals** ([ALNY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALNY)) . Medicines opened nearly 19% higher from the close of its prior session. It surged 22% for the day.


Big volume typically accompanies a breakaway gap. For Medicines, turnover on that day ballooned nearly 10 times average. The spike in turnover that tends to come along with breakaway gaps tells you that it's not retail investors piling in but professionals such as mutual funds and hedge funds. The latter two have the means to send stocks dramatically higher.


Breakaway gaps don't occur out of the blue. Usually there's some kind of news that sends buyers on a frenzy. It can be a big earnings report, new product announcements, improved sales guidance, positive regulatory action and even upgrades or price target changes.


IBD preaches not to buy a stock once it rises more than 5% past a proper buy point within a base. But breakaway gaps amid a healthy market represent a time when it's fine to buy even if a stock is past that buy zone. So if a stock that is in a cup-with-handle base with a 100 entry opens at 110 on news of much better than expected earnings, don't treat it as extended. You haven't missed the boat. In fact, the ride has just taken a more interesting turn.


Not all stocks that have breakaway gaps will go on to bigger and better gain. Some will fizzle. But if you've found a fundamentally sound stock in a base with positive traits and the market is in a strong uptrend, investors should take a shot. There's more going in your favor than not. Of course, losses should still be cut at 8% below your purchase price if the trade doesn't work out.


On April 16, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) staged a big breakaway gap in reaction to better than expected subscriber growth in its first quarter. The firm added 4.88 million subscribers vs. its own earlier forecast of 4.05 million.


The stock opened at 76.02, up nearly 12% from the prior session's close. Netflix also opened well above a 69.62 buy point from a big cup-with-handle base **(1)** and ended the day up 18%. Volume climbed six times its 50-day average.


Netflix made another breakaway gap July 16 on better-than-expected earnings and subscriber growth for Q2 **(2)**. Shares bolted 86% by early August before settling into what would become a new base.

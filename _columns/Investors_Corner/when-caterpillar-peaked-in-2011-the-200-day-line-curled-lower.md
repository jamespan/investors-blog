**How To Sell Winners Like A Pro II:** [Eight In A Series](http://news.investors.com/special-report/623411-sell-like-a-pro-ii-defense.aspx)

The 200-day moving average is not flashy. That doesn't mean you should ignore it.

This chart tool — which captures a stock's price trend over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months — can help you make smart decisions on key issues.

Issue No. 1: whether or not to hold a stock that has rallied significantly but has been showing signs of weakness lately.

Issue No. 2: whether it's time to completely exit a winner.

Let's consider the first issue. If you have a profit cushion of 25% to 125% or more and the stock falls to the 200-day line (or the 40-week line on a weekly chart), you can watch to see if it regains strength and heads up. At this point, the 200-day line should rise or be flat.

IBD's study of great market winners shows that the 200-day often acts as a floor of support so that a stock can craft a new base and break out to new highs.

But if the stock crashes through its 200-day line and the 200-day line itself flattens out and heads lower, it's time to lock in gains. By that point, one or two early sell signals may have already triggered. A 200-day bending lower means the general trend has switched to the downside.

**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) broke out of a base-on-base pattern with a 72.35 buy point in the week ended Sept. 17, 2010, in higher weekly volume. **1** It gained 57% over the next 28 weeks. Not bad for a member of the Dow 30 industrials.

But in April 2011, Caterpillar created a two weeks down, two weeks up pattern. **2** This was not only a flawed base, since cup-without-handle bases must be at least six weeks long, but it also posed as an early sell signal. (This and similar patterns are discussed extensively in [IBD's Chart School advanced workshop](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/chart-school).)

Over the next seven weeks, Caterpillar dropped 18% from its 116.55 peak. It got support at its 40-week moving average. **3** But a month later, it wasn't so lucky.

As the general market caved in late July on eurozone fears, so did the economy-sensitive Caterpillar shares. The stock sliced right through the 40-week line in the heaviest weekly volume in more than a year 4. Caterpillar fell 42% from its high. It did a round trip of its 2010 breakout.

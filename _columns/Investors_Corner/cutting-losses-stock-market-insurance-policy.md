**Master This Sell Rule:** [Investing Tips On When To Sell Stocks](https://www.investors.com/special-report/756667-master-this-sell-rule-investing-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stocks.aspx)

  

Today's Investor's Corner kicks off a series called "Master This Sell Rule." IBD's flagship sell rule is to always cut losses at 7% to 8% below your purchase price. Consider it an insurance policy for every stock you buy.

  

We manage risk in our everyday lives by buying insurance for our car, our health and our home. It makes sense to manage risk in the market by cutting losses short.

  

The biggest mistake in stock investing is not having an exit plan. Many folks are told that buy and hold is the best way to make money in the stock market. But a buy-and-hold approach when investing in growth stocks can do serious damage to a portfolio.

  

Remember your two big winners last year? One ran up 75% in six months. Another was acquired for a 30% premium. It was a good year. But wait a minute. There was another great trade that you forgot about. You cut a loss at 8%; the stock went on to lose 50%. Even though you took a small loss, it was part of a winning trading plan.

  

Indeed, knowing when to sell a stock is just as important as knowing when to buy it. New buys sometimes don't work out; selling losers quickly gives you a chance to invest in a better stock.

  

Decades of IBD market research shows that when a highly rated stock fell 7% to 8% below a proper buy point, it usually didn't have the stuff to be a market leader.

  

Stock market pundits and analysts dole out buy recommendations on a daily basis. But when a recommendation starts falling in heavy volume, you rarely hear them say "sell." In fact, more often than not, investors are told to average down, or buy on weakness, as it heads lower.

  

The "hold and hope" strategy can work out sometimes, but there are plenty of other cases where it won't, and it can result in big damage to a portfolio.

  

No one likes to cut losses short in a stock, especially when you do it a couple of times and the stock turns right around and soars to new highs. Then what happens is you let an 8% loss turn into a 15% loss and the stock keeps going lower until you're sitting on a 50% loss. Basic math says it takes a 100% gain just to break even on a 50% loss.

  

Investors who cut losses short in search engine **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)) after a failed breakout in late 2013 came out looking pretty good. After a tepid breakout over a 41.90 buy point, Yandex rose two more weeks before a wave of institutional selling hit the stock on Jan. 23-24 last year **(1)**. Those who cut losses at 8% when the stock hit 38.55 saved money. By Dec. 16, it hit a low of 15.03.

  

In volatile markets, where breakouts are having a tough time making headway, cutting losses at 3% to 4% below a purchase price is sound strategy. Fact is, you'll normally have a good sense if a breakout is going to have staying power.

  

In the early stages of a bull market, when a stock breaks out in heavy volume, it will often follow through with an additional heavy-volume gain or two. The odds of having to cut losses short in this case are small.

  

But in the later stages of a bull market, when a stock reverses in heavy volume a day or two after a breakout, the odds of having to cut losses short are greater.

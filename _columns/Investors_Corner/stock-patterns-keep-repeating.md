Reading up on the Babylonians or the Sumerians will likely not do much for your trading, but studying stock market history can.


No, you can't go back in time and buy **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) or **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) or **America Online** ([AOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOL)) when they just started their big price runs, but you don't need to. Studying the historical price and volume action of big monster winners, as well as the major market indexes, can train you on what to look for the next time around.


Going back and studying what worked well in the past can prepare you for the future. It can give you insight into the next round of potential market leaders. Like old winners of the past, new leaders will also show the best fundamentals in the form of outstanding earnings, sales, profit margins and return on equity. They will feature the hottest products and services that are changing lives.


What has worked in the stock market in the past is the foundation of the CAN SLIM investment methodology. IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil developed the system by studying the general market action and the biggest individual winners going back more than 100 years.


"In the stock market, history repeats itself. This is because human nature doesn't change," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Stocks have carved out the same patterns that have been the launching pad to big moves year after year. Regardless of whether it was 10, 20, 50 or 100 years ago, the same patterns keep repeating. Cups, cup-with-handles, flat bases, double-bottoms, high-tight flags and others continue to take shape because of the basic human emotions of hope, fear and greed.


**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) was a huge winner in the early 1980s. The home improvement giant came about after Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank were laid off from the Handy Dan chain. Unlike rival hardware outlets, Home Depot's stores were huge and stocked much more merchandise. They offered well-trained staff and held "how to" clinics.


Home Depot went public in October of 1981, but didn't complete its first base until March of 1982 **(1)**. It broke out from a shallow seven-week cup in the week ended March 19, 1982, and gained 26% by late March before consolidating gains. It broke out at a time when the general market was still in a downtrend. But the market turned in August, and Home Depot gained 952% in 14 months.

Just like humans, stocks have a life expectancy — not how long a company will be in business, but how long its stock run will last.




Investors can tell the age of a stock advance by counting the number of bases in its chart. Typically, growth stocks make long-term advances that last roughly two years, usually ending with a bear market or market correction. Along the way, stocks typically form three or four [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/): price consolidations that mainly last seven weeks or longer.


Starting from the bottom of the run, the first two bases historically have afforded the best gains. The odds of a stock running to new highs are highest from these first- and second-stage patterns. Often, stocks find themselves in the initial phases of innovation or investor discovery at this time, when enthusiasm is at a frenzy.


By the time a growth stock forms its third base, investor enthusiasm has waned. Gains tend to be smaller, and the chance of a failed breakout increase. Many growth-stock runs die after the fourth base. Few stocks can sustain a move above such late-stage bases.


Counting Bases In Growth Stocks
-------------------------------


Here's the first rule of counting bases: Stocks must climb at least 20% from the previous [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/) before they can be considered to be in the next stage of base formation. So, if a stock climbs only 10% or 15% from a first-stage base, the next base hasn't graduated to second-stage status. Indeed, a stock can form multiple bases that are all second-stage, for instance.


Only when there's a clear separation between bases — i.e., gains greater than 20% — should the base count move up.


To accurately gauge base stages, first make sure you know how to identify the [principal patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/), such as the flat base, [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/).


With new issues, it's easier to count bases because the stock is just getting started. But stocks don't just keep adding base stages indefinitely. After a long while, base counts reset. Most often, that happens when a decline is so big, the stock undercuts its prior base. An unusually long consolidation — about a year — also resets the base count.


[IBD MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) offers an add-on that identifies most bases and their stage number. Weekly charts are best for counting bases.


Growth Stock's 2020-21 Advance
------------------------------


**![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IC2c_022822-300x161.jpg)CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) was a huge winner in the bull market that followed the Covid-19 outbreak. The first base formed during the market dive and rebound in February-April 2020 **(1)**.


The stock nearly doubled from that base to the next pattern, a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/) in July-August 2020 **(2)**. That second-stage base resulted in a 30% gain to the next base, a six-week [cup](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in October and November **(3)**. The count was now at a third-stage.


Backed by superior profit gains, the cybersecurity leader surged 63% to the next base, an 18-week pattern **(4)**. This was a fourth-stage base and gains from it were expectedly smaller. CrowdStrike based one more time in September and October **(5)**, then the stock rolled over.


It collapsed nearly 50% from the last buy point.

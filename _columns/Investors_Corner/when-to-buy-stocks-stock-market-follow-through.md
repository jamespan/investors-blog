Unfortunately, on Wall Street you won't find a holy grail of a trading system that spits out perfect signals on when to buy stocks. Every trader and longer-term investor must prepare to deal with failed signals.

False signals can even happen with a stock market [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). IBD research has found that it gives the earliest confirmation that a trading-worthy rally may be underway.

The [follow-through is a simple concept](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). It involves a significant gain in higher volume in the Nasdaq or S&P 500. After a serious correction on Wall Street, most follow-through days occur at least four days into a new rally attempt. IBD's [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) flags these critical market turns. When it takes place, investors should actively search for leading stocks that [break out from sound bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).

## When To Buy Stocks: A Follow-Through Can Be A Fakeout

While follow-throughs have marked every major market bottom going back to at least 1900, some follow-throughs don't result in lasting market uptrends. So, reduce your portfolio risk with trading discipline. Avoid buying with reckless abandon when a follow-through occurs. Use the pyramid method to enter your trades. That way, you test the water and put more money to work only if the trades go in your favor.

Pyramiding involves buying in installments instead of all at once. You buy a first piece with half of your total capital allocated for one equity investment. If the stock moves up 2% or 3% from your initial purchase price, make a second buy with 30% of your allotted funds. If the stock goes up 5% from the entry, use your remaining allocated capital to make a final buy.

## Distribution Days Soon After The Follow-Through? Treat Them Like Kryptonite

Follow-through signals are more likely to fail if [big distribution days](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) occur in the first few days of a new uptrend. A distribution day, which points to institutional selling, involves a drop of 0.2% or more in the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 in higher volume vs. the prior session.Â Generally, a distribution day within a few days of a follow-through leads to a failed rally. The risk drops off sharply after the fifth day.

In the early stages of a new uptrend, strong action among leading stocks is crucial. Top-rated stocks should be breaking out of bases in big volume. They should appear in IBD's top stock lists, such as the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). Good breakouts and strong price advances tell you clearly this: Professional investors are stepping back in to buy stocks.

## The 2008 Follow-Through

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IC_111318-300x161.jpg)The years 2007 and 2008 were downright tough for follow-throughs. Many of them failed as the market faced the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 corrected more than 50% off their 2007 highs.

On Oct. 16, 2008, the Nasdaq made a bullish upside reversal and closed up 5.5% in vastly higher trade. It marked a Day 5 follow-through **(1)**. But distribution hit the next day **(2)**, and the correction continued. More follow-through days failed before the one on March 12, 2009, finally worked.

Conviction alone isn't enough to make an investor a winner in the stock market, but without conviction an individual investor won't be able to stick with a great stock.

The fourth installment in this series on psychological traps is about the fear of winning — or, put another way, the inability to hold a winning stock.

It's important to realize that IBD-type investing isn't about rapid-fire trading of fad stocks, as some people believe. Your ultimate goal is to identify a great stock and build a significant position on the way up.

IBD founder William J. O'Neil's biggest winners often involved multiyear gains.

"All told, we bought Pic 'N' Save on 285 different days and held it for 7-1/2 years. When we finally sold it...our early purchases showed more than a 10-fold gain," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

Other stocks that O'Neil rode for multiple years include Price Co., 1982-85; **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), 2004-07; and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), 2004-07 (and Apple again after the bear market ended in 2009).

Holding a big winner isn't easy for the inexperienced investor. The temptation is to take gains prematurely. Economic news and opinions can add to the problem.

As a stock rises, the valuation camp will step forward, tsk-tsking about the high price-earnings ratio. Market watchers will pooh-pooh the great company's new products, insisting that competition will spell the end. Analysts will downgrade the stock. Permabears will insist that the financial world is about to collapse.

How does an investor hold a stock through all the noise?

Four steps can help.

•Step 1: Know the company's story and fundamentals thoroughly. This will help you reject unfounded fears.

•Step 2: Decide a strategy in advance. If you have big gains in a stock and are convinced by your research that the company could become a huge, multiyear winner, then you might decide to hold the stock through a base-building process. This means you are willing to give back part of your gain as the stock shapes the left side of a base.

•Step 3: Stay focused on the weekly chart. If you are focused on either daily action — or, worse yet, intraday moves — you probably will be scared out of the stock. The weekly chart smooths out the daily noise.

•Step 4: Look for sell signals. Suppose the stock has an ugly week. Study the chart. One bad week doesn't necessarily mean you should sell a stock. Ask yourself: Have any sell signals been triggered?

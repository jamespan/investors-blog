"A rising tide lifts all boats." That's just the sort of homily that can get you in hot water.

As a portfolio manager (even if you're only handling your own portfolio), you need to focus on two things: the broad market and the individual stocks you buy.

A huge chunk of a stock's movement is tied to the broad market. So there's truth in the well-worn adage about rising tides. You really only want to be buying stocks while the market is rising, because three out of four stocks tend to follow the general trend. Don't fight the tape.

Yes, maybe you did find one of the few growth stocks that will fare well in a bad market. But most won't, and your search to find the example that disproves the rule will cost you heavily.

IBD can help you get a handle on the market. Check each day the Big Picture's Market Pulse (today on B8). Here you'll see exactly what the market's status is. It could be in a confirmed uptrend (like now), or uptrend under pressure (be cautious) or in a correction. If you see the market is in a correction, you need to stay away from the "buy" button. You also need to raise your defensive posture in the stocks you already own.

Don't ever risk more than 8% from your buy price. Don't let a solid profit, say 10% or more, turn into a loss. Lower your tolerance for bad behavior, such as big declines in high volume.

You need to take these steps. They're easy, and won't take much of your time. They're also crucial.

Now let's say you've identified a roaring bull market. Sorry, you still can't simply rely on that rising tide.

A strong market will mask or ameliorate your stock-picking mistakes. But that's no way to run a portfolio. Finding the best stocks lies at the heart of good investing. Use features such as [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?start=ibd), Big Cap 20, Stocks On The Move, [Stock Spotlight](http://news.investors.com/investing/stock-spotlight.htm) and [Income Investor](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-income-investor.htm) to quickly find the the best names.

What's "the best"? Stocks of those companies with the fastest-growing earnings and sales, the widest profit margins â€” and the most compelling story. Once you've found the right stocks, you need to buy them at the right place and at the right time.

Look for breakouts from attractive bases, or rebounds from the 10-week moving average or some other add-on entry. The chart analysis in IBD's features will guide you.

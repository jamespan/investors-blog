While IBD's 7% to 8% sell rule isn't a painkiller, it can at least serve as a pain reducer.

  

The rule calls for investors to cut their losses short by selling a stock whenever it falls 7% or 8% below their purchase price.

  

It doesn't save you from a loss, since you're still down 7% or 8%. But it should at least mean less pain than you would feel if you let your losses extend to 15%, 25% or worse.

  

You actually can take this rule a step further and often get more aggressive about limiting your losses.

  

For example, in a tough overall market, one smart strategy is to cut your losses at 3% to 5%.

  

The 3% rule comes from observing a 3-1 ratio for taking profits and cutting losses. If you are taking some profits at 25%, then you want to cut losses at 8% for a roughly 3-1 ratio. In a bearish climate, you might take profits at 10% to 15%, so then you would bail out when your losses hit 3% to 5%.

  

**OpenText**'s ([OTEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OTEX)) action in April 2010 offered investors a chance to get aggressive about limiting their losses. The maker of content management software cleared a 49.65 buy point from a flat base on April 23, 2010 **1**.

  

At this point, IBD's Market Pulse outlook was "Market in confirmed uptrend," so you might have been expecting to sell either after a 25% gain or an 8% loss.

  

But after a broad sell-off April 27, the outlook changed to "uptrend under pressure." The S&P cut Greece and Portugal's debt ratings that day, sending stocks plunging in big trade as investors wondered if the euro zone's debt woes would spread. The Big Picture also noted the market's change in character.

  

As the market opened on April 28, it would have been smart to sell OpenText if you had bought it at its ideal buy point of 49.65.

  

After all, the stock was down 5% from the 49.65 buy point as of April 28 **2**, and the overall market had turned more bearish.

  

You also could have gotten aggressive about selling OpenText even earlier. During the session right after OpenText's breakout day, the stock tumbled to its 50-day moving average **3**. Volume on this day, April 26, was strong **4**.

  

It would have been reasonable to sell on April 26, given the 4% drop in heavy turnover.

  

On April 27, the stock continued to act poorly following its breakout, sliding 2% and closing below its 50-day line **5**. On the upside, volume was below average. Still, it would have been reasonable to bail out this day, given that most winning stocks behave better than this after their breakouts.

  

If you had sold on one of these days, you would have avoided some serious pain on April 30, when OpenText plunged 10% after a disappointing quarterly earnings report **6**. It really paid to take the 8% sell rule a step further in this case and get out earlier.

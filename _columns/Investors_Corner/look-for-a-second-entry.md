When somebody smacks you in the face, it's not always a good idea to hit back.

But in the stock market, you should think about buying a stock back again if you get shaken out. Just because a stock hands you a loss of 7% or 8% doesn't necessarily mean that it's game over. It can still be a winner.

It's natural to want to move on after being spurned, but sometimes it's the second mouse that gets the cheese.

Trading isn't just as easy as finding a stock with high ratings and buying it once it breaks out from a base in heavy trading. Nailing down winners on a consistent basis is much tougher than that.

Even if you bought the absolute top stock (the one with industry-leading products and services, best growth rates and showing accumulation from leading mutual funds), there's still no guarantee that you'll be handed a nice profit.

Consider **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) late last year. On Dec. 19, shares of the professional networking website cleared a 238.87 buy point. Volume shot 94% above its 50-day average. But the stock fizzled soon after that and triggered the 8% sell rule Jan. 6.

Getting shaken out of a stock can be frustrating, but it's something traders will experience along the way. Bad news from the company such as disappointing earnings, weaker-than-expected sales or a lackluster outlook can send a stock down in a hurry. So can downgrades or price target changes. And if you trade when the market is in a sketchy environment, a market sell-off can push you out of a stock.

If you get shaken out, look for an opportunity to get back in, especially when the market uptrend resumes. You can look to buy the stock back if it goes on to take out the prior buy point, preferably in big volume. For this, you should continue to watch its day-to-day action. You can also set an alert to let you know when the stock is close to its former buy point again.

It's human nature to want to move on to another stock after being burned. But if the fundamentals and the story behind the company are still good, take another stab when it retakes the buy point.

When you do buy the stock back, you might want to think about buying a few more shares than you did on the initial try. This is counter-intuitive, but it's something that's preached at [IBD workshops](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing).

After getting shaken out, the stock may also go on to form another base. So put it on your watch list. A base needs at least five weeks to take shape, so it might be a while before another buying opportunity presents itself.

On Aug. 18 **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) passed a 352.59 buy point from a five-month cup base. But volume was well below average that day, not what you want to see. The stock chopped its way to a high of 369.21 Sept. 2 **(1)** before fading.

After trading mostly sideways for weeks, the stock started breaking down in October. On Oct. 14, it triggered the 8% sell rule.

The stock, however, staged an upside reversal the next day. On Oct. 17, Regeneron gapped above its 50-day line, rising more than 8% and clearing a new 353.15 handle trigger **(2)**. This time, it broke out with gusto. Volume was 236% above average on news of positive drug trials **(3)**.

Shares rose 24% to 437.64 on Dec. 8 before consolidating gains.

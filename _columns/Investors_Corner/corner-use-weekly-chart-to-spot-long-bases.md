The minimum length for a cup-with-handle base is seven weeks. But sometimes the cup can take significantly longer to form.

So to find these bigger-picture patterns, you should rely more on weekly charts than daily charts.

In most cases, the cup portion of a base alone will be three to six months in length. But bases can take a year or longer to form. If you're looking at daily charts, you could miss the big base.

Cups and other chart patterns are usually a function of the general market. When the market is in an uptrend with normal healthy pullbacks, stocks will usually form shorter formations.

But after being ravaged by a long bear market, bases will take longer to form. Depending on the severity of the correction, the patterns that emerge will typically be deeper.

In a normal market, the high to the low of the cup should be around 15% to about 30%. Growth stocks can correct 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the major indexes' declines in a market correction.

In bear markets, bases can be as deep as 50% or even more and still make productive breakouts once the market improves.

To find the long patterns, scroll through stock lists like the IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and Big Cap 20. You can use IBD Charts at Investors.com to spot bigger-picture patterns. MarketSmith, a more robust chart service, requires a separate subscription.

Aside from the depth of big bases, look for the same characteristics as you would with their smaller counterparts. The cup portion should be U-shaped, and it should not have wide and loose price action.

The pattern should have more accumulation than distribution.

During the global economic turmoil a few years back, many stocks suffered severe corrections but emerged to make new highs.

**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) plunged 74% from its May 2008 peak before bouncing back to form a base **1**.

The base took 16 months to form.

Before Baidu got a chance to clear the left-side high, it pulled back and formed a handle, offering a buy point at a split-adjusted 36.86. The stock cleared the handle the week ended Sept. 11, 2009 **2**, and more than doubled in eight months.

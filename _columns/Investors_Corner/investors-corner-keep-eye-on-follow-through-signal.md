A follow-through day is a special message from the market.

  

It's saying, "Go ahead and buy great stocks that are breaking out of proper bases. The broader trend is again your friend."

  

Not every follow-through leads to a successful uptrend. But research shows that every successful major uptrend over the past 100 years was preceded by a follow-through — no exceptions.

  

Taking action when a follow-through takes place will dramatically improve the timing of your entry into the market after a significant correction has ended. The Big Picture [column](/NewsAndAnalysis/Investing/BigPicture.aspx) tracks follow-through days for you.

  

What is a follow-through day? It's a big advance by at least one of the major indexes — the Nasdaq, the NYSE composite or the S&P 500 — in higher volume than that seen in the prior session.

  

Such strength indicates that institutions are loading up on stocks.

  

How big must the follow-through be? A 1% gain used to be sufficient. But due to higher volatility in recent years, the required gain is now much higher.

  

Volume on the follow-through need not be above average. It simply must increase from the previous day. But the follow-through day must appear on Day 4 or later of an attempted rally. Many of the best follow-throughs have popped up from Day 4 to Day 7, although there's nothing to say that a Day 15 signal wouldn't work.

  

In practically all cases, anything sooner than Day 4 of an attempted rally would not be a valid follow-through.

  

Any one-day gain by any broad-market average after logging a recent low would qualify as Day 1. Volume is not a consideration.

  

Let's look at a classic follow-through the Nasdaq logged on Sept. 1. The index had sunk 17% from its April 26 top when it bottomed on Aug. 27 **1**.

  

Note that the market had been even lower during that correction. It had fallen to 2061.14 on July 1, then rebounded **2**.

  

The NYSE composite and the S&P 500 followed through on July 7, but the Nasdaq's volume was lighter that day **3**. The market's rally didn't last long.

  

The Nasdaq's Sept. 1 follow-through **4** appeared as the index surged 3% in a modest increase in volume from the prior day. Since then, dozens of leaders have produced big gains.

It makes perfect sense that a cup without a handle would have a higher failure rate than a cup with one.


A stock that lacks a handle lacks that final shakeout that scares out the last of the weak holders. In one respect, a stock market cup is analogous to a physical one: With no handle, it increases the likelihood that a hot cup of coffee will burn the user's fingers.


There was a lot wrong with the cup-without-handle base of **Fusion-io** ([FIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIO)) in 2011. Besides lacking a handle, it was V-shaped, extremely deep and showed signs of stalling even as it was rising sharply on the right side.


Fusion went public with a bang. It was priced at \$19, shot quickly up to 33 before sliding back and closing its first day of trading at 22.50. So much for a first-day pop.


But it rallied back to 36.98 the following week. Then, it went into a steep decline before rallying back to a new high. Notice the bottom: It turned on a dime and shot straight up. This was another flaw.


A sound base has a rounded bottom. A longer process of bottoming helps convince large shareholders who lack conviction they are in the wrong stock. Those remaining are prepared to sit with the stock through a longer correction and even add to positions, thereby offering support near the bottom and helping form the right side of the base.


**Too Deep**


Another negative feature is the depth of the correction. It dropped 60% from intraday high to low. That's way too deep. Cups and cup-with-handle bases usually correct up to 33%, although some fall 40% to 50%.


The experienced chart reader would probably stop right there and move on to the next chart.


But there was more to Fusion that could tip off the astute investor to stay away.


Even as the stock rocketed up on the right side, there were a few days that showed stalling action. The stock closed at the middle of its range or the lower part of its range **(1)**, including the day it broke out past a 37.08 entry on Nov. 3. Such action tells the investor that the big money is taking advantage of the rising price to get out.


After hitting a new high, the stock almost immediately failed. At the time, the EPS Rating was an 82, the Relative Strength a 98, and Accumulation/Distribution an A-.


Today, the stock trades near 11.

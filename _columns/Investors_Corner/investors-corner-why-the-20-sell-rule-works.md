Some IBD readers may have a tough time understanding or abiding by the following sell rule:

  

Sell a stock when it rises 20% to 25% past the proper buy point.

  

They might ask: Why should I sell, especially when the market is in a confirmed uptrend, and if it just feels like the stock is going to go up 10 or 20 more points?

  

The answer: Scoring a series of 20% to 25% winners not only offsets the 8% losers in your portfolio, but the gains can add up to a positive return overall. That's because you're maintaining a ratio of close to 3-to-1 on gains to losses.

  

Also, by taking steady profits on your winners, you always keep a bundle of cash in your portfolio for the moment you discover a true market winner that has the power to rise 200% or more.

  

**When To Refuse A 20% Profit**

  

As noted in past Investor's Corner columns, such stocks tend to jump 20% in just one to three weeks after the breakout. This is the exception to the above rule. When you've landed this kind of stock, hold it at least eight weeks and give it a chance to grow.

  

Such stocks don't come often, but they have appeared in every bull market.

  

In the 1990s **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) and America Online led the way. In the 2000s homebuilder **NVR** ([NVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVR)), **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)), **Chico's FAS** ([CHS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHS)) and many others made terrific rallies.

  

Without question, selling winners at 20% to 25% won't feel so great when you see a few of them rally a further 20% or 30% before going into a serious correction. But remember: You simply have no way of knowing that such a stock will keep going up. Profit leakage is inevitable. So sell and move on to your next new buy.

  

**Similar To The 8% Rule**

  

The scenario is similar with IBD's golden rule: Always sell a stock if it falls 7% to 8% from your purchase price.

  

An 8% pullback may simply be temporary, and the stock might bounce back and rally to new highs. It would be easy to say, "Well, I didn't need to follow the rule this time."

  

That's not the point. You gain in the long run by guarding yourself from a catastrophic decline. To minimize these sells, always buy right at the buy point, not when it's already risen 10% or 20% or even more.

  

Let's say you start with a \$50,000 portfolio with no margin. You focus solely on companies featured in the IBD 50, Daily Stock Analysis and other IBD screens.

  

The market follows through and trends higher for six months. You buy two stocks with \$25,000 each, and then sell each for a 25% gain. Now you're up \$12,500, or 25%.

  

Your next three picks backtrack fast, so you sell for a 7% loss each time. Each time, the position size was \$25,000. Due to your discipline, you lost just \$1,750 on each trade. The total loss of \$5,250 brings your portfolio back to a \$7,250 gain, up 14.5%. Not bad.

  

You make two more fresh buys, again each with \$25,000 cash. One rises 20%, and you nail down a \$5,000 gain. But the other one sprinted up 20% in only a week, so you hold on for at least eight weeks. By the end of the year, it grows into a 150% winner and you lock in all your gains. Pat yourself on the back: Your portfolio has grown to \$99,750, up almost 100%.

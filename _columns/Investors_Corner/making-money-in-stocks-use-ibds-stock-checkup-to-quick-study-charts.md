The old craftsman's adage preaches, "Use the right tool for the job." But every artisan knows how to improvise in a pinch and often discovers in the bargain that the right tool is usually one's brain.

So, what if we used [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), a premium feature at Investors.com, in order to spot-check the quality of a stock's base? At the very least, it can get you off to a smart start.

Let's study the ETF asset management service company **WisdomTree Investments** ([WETF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WETF)) during its action in the spring and summer of 2013.
At the time, the stock was carving higher in the 10th week of a V-shaped [cup base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). The base showed a reasonable correction that was 28% deep, and the stock had been climbing the right side for the past four weeks. That base ultimately failed, but a longer, stronger new cup base emerged and this one ultimately led to a profitable breakout.

Scan down the Stock Checkup, which IBD readers can access at the [Research](http://research.investors.com/) section on the home page of Investors.com, and you would have found that most of the lights are green, a good sign.

Technical factors will always weigh more heavily than fundamentals in scoring the base.

On the technical side, WisdomTree got a red light on price, which was trading below 13 a share in late September 2013. It got a caution sign on the Up/Down Volume Ratio, which gauges buying and selling pressure on a stock. That ratio edged up to a neutral 1.0; 1.1 or higher is ideal.

One of the most important things that the Stock Checkup tells you is whether you should be looking at other stocks in the group ahead of your current pick.

WisdomTree had a solid Composite Rating of 97. Only one higher-rated stock was in the group. WisdomTree's 94 Relative Price Strength was fourth best. In both cases, it's easy to check the higher rated stocks and see how they compare.

On the fundamental side, WisdomTree's EPS Rating ranked 17th in the group. This was surprising, given the stock's strong quarterly numbers. But WisdomTree had only two years of annual gains in earnings per share under its belt. This weighed down the ranking.

Its top-notch SMR rating of A helped offset the difference and is equal to the best in the group.

![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IC_wetf_092717-300x169.jpg)WisdomTree's Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a B-, 31st in the group. That's not great, but it also doesn't really jibe with the picture of institutional accumulation we get when we eyeball its weekly chart.

The chart showed three out of four weeks up on the right side of the base trading in below-average volume. In all four of these weeks, however, WisdomTree ended in the upper half of the week's range; this suggests accumulation even if volume is weak.

Also, the stock bottomed out in strong trade and ended high in the range in the week ended June 28 **(1)**. These are both solid signs. The base's main weakness, other than the stock's low price, was its V-shaped outline.

As the weekly chart shows, WisdomTree failed to break out of that flawed base, and its Checkup indicated that the stock wasn't truly the top dog. But the ratings remained good overall, and WisdomTree went on to form a much better cup pattern.

Notice how the new 12-week cup base featured a shallower decline from head to toe, just 23%. The new cup featured a more rounded look, which was a hint that institutions were gradually accumulating shares and preventing the stock from making another sharp-nosed decline.

What else was good about the new cup base? Almost all of the down weeks came in lighter-than-average turnover, a good sign. And volume picked up on the right side of the new base.

In the week ended Oct. 25, WisdomTree broke out with a 6.7% gain in heavy trading. That big move sent the stock past a 13.93 buy point in a 12-week cup-type base that formed right next to another V-shaped and faulty cup base.

WisdomTree then suddenly took a break. Over the next four weeks, the stock traded in a tighter range. Yet it still included a test of that buy point and a rebound off the 10-week moving average near 12.95 **(2).** At one point, shares fell 6.4% below the 13.93 entry to 13.04, which was not enough to execute the [golden rule of selling](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

Plus, the positive reversal in the week ended Nov. 22 illustrates how waiting for the stock's finish by the end of the week can prove wise.

WisdomTree's breakout finally got going. Ten weeks into the late-October breakout, the stock rallied as much as 29.8% to a high of 18.08, a great time to sell and lock in gains **(3)**. WisdomTree soon peaked and suffered a serious correction that exceeded 50% from the stock's all-time high of 18.50.

**IBD'S TAKE**: _In the stock market, buying is important, but selling is perhaps more so. Catch several stocks at their breakout from a proper buy point and sell most of them when they reach 20% to 25%, and you'll have an excellent year for your portfolio.

Final analysis? WisdomTree's example suggests Stock Checkup is helpful for added perspective or a cursory initial check. But it confirms that nothing substitutes for the skill of learning to directly read and study price-and-volume charts.

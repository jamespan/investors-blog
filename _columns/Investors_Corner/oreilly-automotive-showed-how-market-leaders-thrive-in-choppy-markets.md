**Handling A Choppy Uptrend:** _[Third In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/621258/201208071356/handling-a-choppy-uptrend.aspx)_

Choppy markets are hard â€” even on the best stocks. But savvy investors know that some companies manage to rack up strong gains during periods of volatility.

Such was the case last summer and fall, when IBD's Market Pulse (which accompanies the [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/search/searchresults.aspx?source=filterSearch&Ntt=The+Big+Picture&Nr=OR%28Column%3aThe+Big+Picture%2cEducation%2fHelp+Type%3aThe+Big+Picture%29)) seesawed from "Confirmed Uptrend" to "Uptrend Under Pressure" to "Market In Correction."

It's easy to decide what to do when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend. But when the market is choppy it's best to lower your expectations and tighten up your sell rules.

**O'Reilly Automotive** ([ORLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORLY)) began forming a long saucer with handle in December 2010 with a buy point of 61.39. It broke out above that buy point on June 17, 2011, in volume that was 76% above average 1.

O'Reilly was benefiting as consumers looked to save money by doing their own repairs or by taking their vehicles to independent mechanics, who tend to buy less expensive aftermarket parts from the likes of O'Reilly.

The stock ran up 8% after the breakout to a peak of 66.52 on July **1** before it started to roll over along with the market. **2** IBD's Market Pulse switched to "Uptrend Under Pressure" on July 11, which may have prompted investors to exit the stock and pocket a gain of about 6%.

Those who held on were in for a rough ride. By July 27, when the market went into correction, the stock had given up almost all of its gains. By early August, the stock had fallen 8% below its buy point, forcing IBD-style investors to sell. **3**

But strong stocks in choppy markets typically offer a number of chances to buy and sell, and O'Reilly rewarded those who kept an eye on the stock after being shaken out.

The stock began climbing back, finally jumping above its 10-week moving average line in strong volume on Aug. 23. **4** On that day, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq recorded a follow-through, putting the market back into a confirmed uptrend.

Those who jumped back and held on endured a bumpy but ultimately rewarding ride as the Market Pulse flipped back and forth between correction and confirmed uptrend.

O'Reilly pulled back to its rising 50-day moving-average line several times, but it never gave off a sell signal. It never closed below its 50-day line. Volume in each pullback was tame.

O'Reilly went on to a peak of 107.13 on May 4, 2012, before crashing below its 50-day line in high volume. The profit from the original buy point at 61.39 was 75%. It was about 70% for those who bought when the stock crossed its 50-day line as the new market uptrend began Aug. 23.

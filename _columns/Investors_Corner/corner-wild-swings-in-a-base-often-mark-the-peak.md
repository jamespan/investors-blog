  Corner: Wild Swings In A Base Often Mark The Peak

In 2000, when the Nasdaq's tech bubble peaked, **JDS Uniphase** ([JDSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JDSU)) presented a fine example of how late-stage bases tend to be wide and loose, and thus fail.

  

The producer of fiber-optic equipment for the telecom market was a darling in 1999, a time when putting ".com" on a company name seemed an acceptable way to increase shareholder wealth.

  

After breaking out of a first-stage cup-with-handle base in the week ended Dec. 4, 1998, the stock catapulted from a price of 7.26 (adjusted for three 2-for-1 splits) to a peak of 153.42, a 2,013% gain.

  

Common sense would tell you to take at least some profits when a growth stock has risen that much.

  

Alas, we're greedy!

  

That's why analyzing a stock's chart action and accepting its topping clues is critical. Emotions are subjective, but charts are objective.

  

In the case of JDS, the four-month cup-with-handle formed in 2000 **1** instantly appeals to our bullish psyche. "What's not to like?" you might ask.

  

After all, it showed several up weeks in heavy volume. The three-week handle slanted lower **2**.

  

But a closer inspection revealed flaws. The way in which JDS slid in the week ended April 14, 2000 **3**, was as elegant as a ballet dancer landing on the stage with ski boots.

  

Not only did the stock fall 35% for the week, but the range from that week's high of 124.63 to its low of 77 was an astonishing 62%. The next two weeks were just as volatile.

  

When a stock, after forging an excellent price run, starts trading more wildly than ever before, it's a sign that fund managers are shifting from net buying to net selling.

  

Such wild swings were absent when the stock earlier formed tighter consolidations, including a tightly wound base-on-base and a five-week square box. ([Click here](/NewsAndAnalysis/PhotoPopup.aspx?path=WEBcor0310.jpg&docId=565413) to see the weekly chart.)

  

Another selling rule was triggered: a reversal in huge volume soon after a breakout **4**.

  

The Feb. 3 Investor's Corner ([click here](/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/561794/201102021755/Sell-Rule-No-22-Rising-Volatility-Can-Mark-The-Peak.aspx)) discusses how excessively high volatility typically marks a great stock's peak.

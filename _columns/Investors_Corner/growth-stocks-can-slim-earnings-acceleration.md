Many factors influence the behavior of the best growth stocks — products, markets, management, stock market conditions, regulatory environment. But the single most important gauge of a company's performance, with regard to its potential stock behavior, is earnings.




That was the conclusion of [IBD founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/). A study of history's best growth stocks from 1952 to 2001 found that "three out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the latest publicly reported quarter before they began their major advances," O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


"You may find that only 2% of all stocks listed on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange will show earnings gains of this size," O'Neil wrote. "But remember: You're looking for stocks that are exceptional."


Growth Stocks, Earnings And The A In CAN SLIM
---------------------------------------------


That is how the A in the [CAN SLIM growth stock investing stratagem](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) came to stand for annual earnings increases over the past five years. Annual EPS growth should, ideally, be 20% or better, averaged over the last three to five years.


On a quarterly basis, you would like to see EPS growth average at least 25%, year over year. (This is [the C in CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/).) And you want to see some acceleration, meaning those rates of increases rise, at least in small increments, over several consecutive quarters.


This tells you the company is doing something right or, if not right, then at least profitable. It is squeezing more income from every dollar of revenue it takes in.


You can also keep an eye on a stock's [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/) from IBD. This is easily found by typing a stock's ticker sign into the search window at investors.com, or through using the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


The EPS Rating measures a company's earnings growth and stability over the past five years vs. all the stocks in IBD's database. A rating of 99 means the stock is in the top 1%.


Factors used in the calculation include: earnings growth in the two recent quarters vs. the respective year ago quarters; the five year earnings growth rate; and earnings stability. Items are weighted by a proprietary calculation.


CoreSite: Five Quarters of EPS Growth Acceleration
--------------------------------------------------


Good recent examples of accelerating earnings gains include **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)). Its earnings growth accelerated from 22% to 209% in the five quarters through June of this year. **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) is hovering around an 81.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [11-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). [The Leaderboard stock](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) expanded its year-over-year profit gains from 1% to 39% over the past four quarters.



A more classic example is the real estate investment trust **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)) in 2014. The owner and operator of data centers reported, for the second quarter of 2014, a 13% increase in funds from operations (a standard metric for profits in the REIT industry) from the previous year. The following quarter's earnings increase came in at 17%.


Then things started getting interesting. FFO jumped 24%, 25%, 33% and 35% — five straight quarters of accelerating growth — through Sept. 2015.


In October 2014, CoreSite jumped out of a [seven-week cup](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/) with a 36.57 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and rallied 41% over the next four months. Within 20 months of the breakout, it had gained 151%.

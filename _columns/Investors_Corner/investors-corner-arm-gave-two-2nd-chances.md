If you miss a breakout, don't chase the stock. You may find yourself quickly shaken out. Instead, be patient and wait for a secondary buying opportunity.

Your second chance could come soon, but sometimes it takes time to develop. Either way, investors need to wait for a proper setup.

British chip designer **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)) offered two secondary entries during last year's stellar run. The stock may have been off some investors' radar as it broke out while trading below \$15 a share.

ARM Holdings had a convincing story. The company isn't a household name like **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) or **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). But the Cambridge, England, company designs chips for 95% of the world's mobile phones.

ARM designed chips for **Apple's** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) red-hot iPhone, for example.

ARM shares cleared a 12.31 buy point from a six-week cup-without-handle base in the week ended June 11 **1**. Volume surged to nearly 300% above average on the day of the breakout.

At the time, ARM had solid IBD Ratings: Composite Rating 96, Earnings Per Share 77, Relative Price Strength 95, an A for SMR. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a not-so-great C-. ARM's industry group, Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless, was rated No. 20 out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD.

The stock rose 7% over the next three sessions. In this case, investors didn't have to wait long for a second buying opportunity; the stock soon formed a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 13.27 buy point.

It cleared the short consolidation in the week ended July 9 **2**. ARM rallied 24% by late July before pulling back to test its 10-week moving average for the first time since the June breakout.

ARM retreated to this key technical area in light volume **3** â€” a good sign that big investors such as mutual funds and hedge funds didn't dump lots of shares. Their support is critical.

The stock found support almost smack at its 10-week line. The rebound created a buying range. Investors can buy the stock when it bounces off the line or sometimes when it takes out the prior high.

For ARM, volume was initially light but later picked up. Shares punched a new high in the week ended Sept. 3 **4**.

IBD's market columns often refer to corrections, both in the market and in stocks. But what does the word "correction" really mean?

Generally speaking, a correction refers to a period of price decline, whether in a stock or the overall market. For instance, the pullback from the left side of a cup base to its bottom is a correction. A bear market is a correction that's deeper and longer than most.

Corrections aren't necessarily bad. In fact, they are a natural and necessary part of the stock market cycle, since they give stocks a chance to digest their gains and form new bases, or even reset their base counts.

The correction within a base helps determine what kind of pattern the stock is forming and whether the depth is proper. A flat base should pull back no more than 15% from its absolute high, while a cup-shaped base can range from about 12% to 33%.

In the market itself, corrections come in different depths and lengths. They can be fairly minor, sending the major indexes down 8% to 12% over a few weeks. In the most recent correction that ended with the Oct. 21 follow-through day, the S&P 500 pulled back 10%.

But they can be sizable too. When the market falls 20% or more, that's considered a bear market, which tends to last longer than a short- or mid-term correction. During the 2008 bear market, for instance, the S&P 500 slumped 58% over a five-month period.

"Since 80% to 90% of price patterns are created during market corrections, you should never get discouraged and give up on the stock market's potential during intermediate-term sell-offs or short or prolonged bear markets," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil says in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

IBD's market outlook has three settings: in confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure and in correction. The market environment is crucial to investment success, since three of four stocks eventually follow the market's trend. That means more stocks will likely rise when the market is in a confirmed uptrend â€” but the majority will fall during a correction.

Why is it important to track corrections?

They can make a big dent in your portfolio, which is why buy-and-hold investing doesn't work on a consistent basis. It's also rare that the same leaders going into a correction will outperform after it ends.

That's why selling ahead of a correction and raising cash while awaiting a new uptrend is a sound strategy.

Investors can learn to spot market tops and bottoms by studying the price and volume action of the major indexes as well as leading stocks. IBD helps you by discussing each day's market action in The Big Picture column (today on B3). The accompanying Market Pulse table highlights the market direction.

The chart above shows the 2011 bear market, when the S&P 500 corrected as much as 22% from its May high near 1370 to its Oct. 4 bottom of 1074.77. IBD readers would have noted the distribution days and a change in the outlook to "Market in correction" pointed out in The Big Picture in the weeks leading up to the decline.

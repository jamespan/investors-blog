Hope is a powerful emotion, right up there with love, pride, anger and fear.


These emotions guide and enrich our lives. But they're useless when it comes to stocks.


You can love a stock or hate it. You can hope for all the world that it rises or that it recovers after a slide. You can lose sleep for fearing a winner is about to crumble and take with it all your gains.


The stock market does not care.


In this respect, the market is heartless. It behaves according to the collective financial strategies and the economic and industry outlooks of institutional investors. For this reason, one of your primary goals as an investor should be to develop the ability to set emotion aside and look simply at the factors actually affecting your stocks.


In that process, it is important to realize that hope is also a stealthy emotion. It can creep in to infect the way you see your stocks and tint your analytical ability.


A key spot for such problems to occur is when one of your stocks dips into moderate losses. Maybe it's only down 3% or 4% in a weak market, or the market is in good shape but the stock has cut below the 7% to 8% automatic sell line. Maybe you poured hours into researching the stock, used the company's products, believe in its potential, have meticulously analyzed the technicals and are proud of your work.


It'll come back, you tell yourself.


Wishful thinking. The reality is this: The stock may or may not come back. There is no way to know. In the face of that uncertainty, there are rules. Those rules, based on historical experience, are designed to give you an advantage in a situation where, figuratively speaking, you cannot see your hand in front of your face.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was still a wonderful and brilliantly led company as its stock broke below 10-week support in October of 2012. Eighteen months later, investors who held are still waiting for parity. In the meantime, they have watched the Nasdaq climb 36%.


In July 2008, **Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) pierced support and sank more than 8% below a 216.07 buy point **(1)** after a massive run-up. Within five months it had lost 80% of its value.


This is where other emotions take over. Hope cycles into disappointment, despair, feelings of incompetence.


If you keep your head on straight, you'll realize this is another opportunity. Shed these useless and distracting emotions. Don't let them color your understanding of how to read the day-to-day market or go about finding and qualifying new potential winners.


If you feel you absolutely need to put your hope to use, hope for clarity, then do the legwork needed to un-muddy the view.

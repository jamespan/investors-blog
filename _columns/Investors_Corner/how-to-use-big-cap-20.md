As IBD stock screens go, the IBD Big Cap 20 is of a different stripe.


A primary focus on large-capitalization stocks distinguishes it from the high-growth slant of the IBD 50 or Your Weekly Review. But that doesn't mean that the IBD Big Cap 20, which runs in Tuesday's paper, won't find its fair share of winning stocks before they start big price advances.


The Big Cap 20 is also featured in the [eTables](http://research.investors.com/etables/default.aspx?nav=ResearcheTables) online product.


Some big companies can still produce robust gains in earnings and share prices. A look back at some of the stocks that made the Big Cap 20 aptly illustrate that point (more on that later).


To find the winners in this weekly feature, investors should follow a systematic approach.


Start by studying the mini weekly charts that are published for each of the 20 stocks. Separate the ones that are forming bases or in secondary buy areas.


Not sure how to spot them? You've got help. The bottom of each chart shows a brief analysis, written by IBD market writers, that tells readers if the stock is near a buy point or too far extended in price to be of immediate interest. In many cases, this analysis gives the correct buy point. Do not buy until the stock hits this buy point.


For more analysis, read the Big Cap 20 column. Here, you can learn more about the stocks setting up in attractive chart zones, as well as which industry sectors are showing leadership among big caps.


In June of last year, the stock market was struggling, yet top-rated stocks **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) and **Biogen Idec** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) formed bases during that time. Both also made the June 11 Big Cap 20 list.


Google was finding support at its 10-week moving average. The chart analysis noted the action. Google continued a long consolidation and broke out on Oct. 18 in a powerful gap-up sparked by a solid earnings report.


Shares surged 36% until peaking in February. Google's 21% EPS gain was smaller than what investors had seen from the Internet giant in its halcyon days. Yet it was in line with other Big Cap 20 firms; double-digit growth for large, mature companies denotes market leadership and strength.


Biogen had found support and eventually formed a cup-with-handle base. The stock broke out Sept. 11; after a few pullbacks, it gained 53% by March this year.


In the June 4, 2013, edition of the Big Cap 20, fellow biotech **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) was forming a base. After a July 11 breakout, it shot up 32% to its Jan. 13 peak of 174.66.

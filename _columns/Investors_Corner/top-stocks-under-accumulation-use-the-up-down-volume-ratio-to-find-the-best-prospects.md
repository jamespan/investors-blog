It's often said that earnings growth is the main driver of a stock's price performance. That's true, but top stocks also benefit from institutional buying.

When big investors such as mutual funds, banks and insurance companies start buying, big volume always gives them away. And big volume is the fuel for powerful upside moves.

IBD readers are familiar with the [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-new-stock-market-leaders/), which measures institutional buying and selling in a stock over the past three months. Heavy-volume up days help the rating, while heavy-volume down days hurt it. Stocks are rated on an A+ to E scale. A+ means heavy institutional buying. E signifies heavy institutional selling.

The up/down volume ratio is another good way to find top stocks under accumulation. The ratio covers 50 days of trading. Divide total volume on up days by total volume on down days to get the ratio. Target stocks with ratios above 1.0 at their breakouts.

The up/down volume ratio is available in the Technical Performance section of [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) at Investors.com. The ratio is also found in [MarketSurge weekly charts](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) and on [Leaderboard charts](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint).

Just like the A/D Rating, heavy-volume gains and low-volume declines will help the up-down volume ratio. But heavy-volume declines and low-volume gains will hurt the ratio.

## Top Stocks: Strong Demand

The accompanying table shows several market leaders that had strong up/down volume ratios in May 2021.

**West Pharmaceutical Services** ([WST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WST)), an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/), cleared a 13-week consolidation in April 2021. It rallied nicely from there and then flashed a series of [tight weekly closes](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/) that yielded an add-on entry. Its up/down volume ratio was 1.6 the week of the breakout.

**UPS** ([UPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPS)) traded tightly near highs after the stock gapped up in late April 2021 on strong earnings. The up/down ratio was 1.2 the week of the April breakout that preceded the gap-up.

**Pool** ([POOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POOL)) held gains nicely after a breakout from a cup base in April of 2021, when the up/down ratio was 1.3. A strong earnings report was the catalyst.

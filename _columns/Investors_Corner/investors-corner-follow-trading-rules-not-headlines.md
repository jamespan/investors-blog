If you just trade off the headlines, you'll quickly go broke.

CAN SLIM buy and sell rules almost entirely avoid the subject of news releases. Of course, a big earnings surprise or an upward sales revision is worth your time and attention. Such news may spark a breakout.

But the meat and potatoes of buying are a stock's fundamentals and technicals. The sell side, though, is really all about the chart. Often, the news that sends a stock falling arrives much later than you think.

You know what to look for in a good stock: fast-growing earnings and sales, wide margins, a new product or service that takes the country by storm.

Does that sound like a lot to ask? Remember, there are thousands of stocks out there. You only need a few to succeed. As for those innovative offerings, we see them every day: robotics in the operating room (**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)), streaming movies over the Internet (**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), cloud computing (**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), iMacs, iPhones and iPads (you know who).

Then all you need is a chart that offers a valid entry point, a breakout from a base or a rebound from the 10-week moving average.

As for selling, some signs tell you when you're in trouble. For example, the stock falls through key support in heavy volume. Or it makes new highs in an eerie lack of volume. Or you just decide 25% is a fine profit to take â€” a key IBD rule for handling most stocks.

**Southern Copper** ([SCCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCCO)) had been abuzz last year with talk of opening a big copper project in Peru.

The Tia Maria project in southern Peru would cost \$934 million to open, and would produce 120,000 tons of copper per year. At \$4 per pound of copper, the firm would recoup its investment in a year.

The company had already been notching great profit growth and paying a fat dividend, a rare combination. But it didn't start moving up until late September **1**. If you had simply acted on talk of this proposed project, you'd have bought the stock and gotten stopped out several times.

Let's say you bought Southern Copper at its September breakout and enjoyed the promise of a new stream of copper-driven income.

Peru's government announced April 8 that the project, which had the president's approval, would be canceled. Local residents were adamantly opposed to the Tia Maria project from the beginning, citing environmental hazards.

Would you have waited for this bad news to sell? Let's hope not.

Southern Copper topped out at 50.35 on Jan. 3. The stock that day logged a bearish reversal **2** . It cleanly pierced its 10-week moving average two weeks later **3**.

Southern Copper is now 29% off that peak. More to the point, it had already dived 21% by April 8 **4**, the day the bad news appeared.

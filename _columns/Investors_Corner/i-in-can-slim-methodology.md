When you're researching a possible addition to your stock portfolio, you want to make sure the big institutions are buying it, too.


That means big mutual funds, pension funds and hedge funds. They, not your Aunt Tilly in North Dakota, have the buying power to drive a stock higher.


With billions of dollars to deploy, they must wade into each position slowly so they don't dramatically raise the price. It may take weeks for them to build a position.


This is the "I" in CAN SLIM, or institutional sponsorship.


**Serious Buying Power**


The first important clue that institutions are climbing aboard is trading volume. The big funds mostly avoid thinly traded stocks. You should stick to stocks that trade an average of 400,000 shares a day. Much of your portfolio should have stocks trading at least 1 million or more shares a day. Those are the ones the big funds are trading.


Since 2004, mutual funds are required to report their holdings on a quarterly basis to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which makes them public. (Before that, the reporting period was six months.) There is a delay in the reporting, but that doesn't affect their usefulness to individual investors, except for recent new issues, which might have not yet reported mutual fund sponsorship.


A good source for tracking mutual and hedge fund ownership is [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com), a research tool produced by IBD's sister company. It lists the number of funds in a given company going back more than four quarters. You want to see the number of funds buying a company increasing, and you want the number to be significant. If only a handful of funds own it and ownership isn't spreading, you have to ask yourself why it's being avoided.


**Avoid Fund Shrinkage**


And if the number is decreasing significantly, you have to wonder why mutual fund managers are selling.


Another good clue you can get from studying institutional ownership is whether the best mutual fund managers own it.


You can scan a list of fund ownership to see if a number of A-rated funds own it.


**Track The Best**


Another critical factor when judging a stock is whether any of the very best managers own the stock. A source of this is IBD's "What's The Market Trend?" page, today on B4.


Near the bottom of the page each day is a chart of the IBD Mutual Fund Index, made up of 20 funds that have been hand-picked by IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil. He considers these managers among the top stockpickers in the country.


These managers typically have the best analysts working for them and the best sources of information. They spend long days hunting for the next big winner.


They include Will Danoff of the Fidelity Contrafund, Ken Heebner of CMG Focus, Bill Miller of Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunity and Tom Ognar of Wells Fargo Advantage Growth.


O'Neil wants to see at least one of the top managers with a position in the stock. If none of them own it, O'Neil assumes they have studied the stock and rejected it. If all of them have rejected it, why would you want to buy it?

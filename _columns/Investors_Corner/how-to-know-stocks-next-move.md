  Stocks On The Move List Can Point Investor Right Way

In the old days, an individual investor was sort of like the guy who saw every situation as a nail because the only tool he had was a hammer.


Detailed and timely information about stocks was hard for the ordinary investor to find. For example, stock listings in financial newspapers would give you a stock's price change but not the volume. Investors had no way of knowing if a big price move was accomplished in strong or weak volume.


So big price moves were seen as hammer-like when they might've had all the hammering power of a wet noodle.


Thanks to IBD's efforts over the past 29-1/2 years, volume has stepped up to take its rightful place next to price. Volume is a useful and indispensable tool for gauging a stock's tone.


IBD takes volume seriously. The Stocks On The Move listing (at right and on the home page of Investors.com) tells investors which stocks are making sizable price moves in above-average volume. Rising stocks with EPS and Relative Strength ratings of 80 or better are boldfaced.


A rating of 80 means a stock's earnings growth is better than about eight of every 10 stocks. For the RS Rating, 80 means its price has outperformed eight of every 10 stocks over the past 12 months.


The naive investor might look at Stocks On The Move and say: "Big deal. You just showed me what I should've bought yesterday. What good is that? I want to know what's going up tomorrow."


The truth is, nobody knows which stocks are going up tomorrow. Mathematician John Allen Paulos, in his 1989 book "Innumeracy," told about a stock prediction scam. You send out 32,000 letters (today it would be email), half predicting the market will go up tomorrow and half predicting it will go down. The second mailing only goes to those who received a correct prediction, and it is split in the same way. Repeat this, and after round six, 500 people will believe you predicted the market's direction six sessions in a row.


Those who want to know "what's going up tomorrow" will be convinced that a genius is offering to guide them.


A more adult approach, of course, is to realize the market cannot be predicted. The key value of price-and-volume action is telling you whether institutional money is going into a stock or out of a stock. If it happens repeatedly, then you probably are getting a hint of where the stock is going.


How should an investor use Stocks On The Move?


Look for patterns in sectors: Are oil stocks or some other set of stocks rising or falling in fast trade? If you glance at Stocks On The Move daily, you will begin to see stocks in certain groups appear again and again.


Look for breakouts: If a stock is rising to a new high, that's worth your attention. If it's bouncing up after a deep correction, that's probably not worth your immediate attention: Such a stock still has a lot of overhead supply to work through. Wait for the base to form.


Overhead supply denotes areas of upside resistance. The resistance is tied to previous purchases of the stock, and to those investors who will sell as the price returns to their break-even point.


IBD can't and won't promise that the issues in Stocks On The Move will go up tomorrow. But the listing is a useful tool for those who learn to use it.

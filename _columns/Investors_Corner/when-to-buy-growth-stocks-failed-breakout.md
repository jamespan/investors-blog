  How To Buy Growth Stocks: What To Do After A Failed Breakout

Learning from the history of failed breakouts clearly holds benefits. If you study a number of growth stocks that made failed breakout attempts, you may find clues on how to read the warning signs and steer clear of others that show the same flaws.




The failures start when a [stock clears a proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), then falls back more than 8% below that mark. This triggers the [golden sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/): Get out no deeper than 7% to 8% below your purchase price.


But then what?


Keep in mind that a failed breakout doesn't necessarily signal a failed stock. Many stocks with solid fundamentals recover, retake buy points and make winning runs. In some cases, the stock was ready to rally, but the market was not.

How A Failed Breakout In Growth Stocks Is Not A Permanent Failure
-----------------------------------------------------------------



**W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)), a maintenance and industrial supplies distributor, built a flawed base that began in July 2011. For starters, the base had a V-shaped look. The base featured unusually heavy selling on the left side **(1)** — poor characteristics.


It still managed to [form a handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) with a 156.95 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and broke out in strong trade Sept. 13, 2011 **(2)**. The stock climbed for three days, then hit a peak of 165.55 and reversed. Over the next several days it dove more than 8% below the [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). That triggered the [golden rule of investing in growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wIC-121818-300x165.jpg)Grainger slid below its 50-day moving average in strong trade. But the industrial and construction sector stock also found firm support at the 200-day moving average **(3)**.


Buyers who got burned by the faulty breakout may have gone looking for other candidates into which to rotate cash. But Grainger proved it wasn't yet a goner.


Let's say you've done your homework on the stock. If it has leadership-grade fundamentals, there's no harm in keeping an eye on it. Why? A rebound from support at the 200-day line and a rise back through the prior base's 156.95 buy point put Grainger back in play.


Grainger Gets Off The Mat
-------------------------


Keep tabs on signs of heavy accumulation. Up days in higher volume and closes in the top half of the trading range suggest that institutions may be quietly at work, picking up shares.


Grainger closed at the top of its trading range for three consecutive days after it regained the 200-day line **(4)**. Volume rose on the first and third days, too. All good signs. It [retook the buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) Oct. 12 in mild volume. Not yet a buy.


Grainger hovered for three days, then [staged a true breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) Oct. 18, 2011, with a 7% gain in nearly double its average trade **(5)**. The stock climbed 40% in five months to a high of 221.84. The run offered plenty of opportunities to bag gains of 20%-25% or more, a [key offense-style sell signal](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/).

Pay close attention to what the market does each day. Judge the strength of leading stocks. Decide to hold or sell based on how your holdings are actually behaving every week vs. your expectations. Such investing tips help lead to success with the [CAN SLIM investing system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/).

How about three more tips to help boost your investing game? None have to do with stock charts or a score of [IBD ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/).

The first of three investing tips? Get plenty of rest.

This doesn't mean simply logging enough hours of sleep or naps each day. Jared Tendler, a coach to stock market traders, professional poker players and PGA tour-caliber golfers, recommends taking at least one full week away from the market each quarter. Plus, taking a three-day weekend per month at the minimum may help boost trading longevity.

"Mental burnout is real. You're not able to consolidate knowledge in your head. Traders don't appreciate the time they need to take off in order to stay sharp," Tendler, author of "The Mental Game of Trading: A System for Solving Problems with Greed, Fear, Anger, Confidence and Discipline," told IBD.

The benefits of time away from your computer screen? "You'll come up with better ideas," he added. You create time to reflect more often on what you did well and what you did wrong; future changes may lead to more consistent profits.

Second tip? Proper diet and nutrition count.

"The idea that has helped non-athletes, including traders and poker players, is to think of themselves as athletes," Tendler said. "Your decision process is equivalent to a golfer's swing or a pitcher's motion. If you think this way, what helps you stay at your best becomes more important."

## More Investing Tips: Mind What You Eat

Kate Schade, founder of Victor, Idaho-based Kate's Real Food bars, uses honey as a natural sweetener for her energy bars instead of processed sugar.

"Honey's nutritional composition includes antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids — all great for our bodies' cellular health and boosting immunity!" Schade told IBD in an email exchange. Honey replenishes depleted glycogen stores quickly and "provides a longer sustained energy than other sweeteners."

Kate's bars use complex carbohydrates in the form of oats and brown rice crisps, plus peanut butter, almond butter, cherries, cranberries, chocolate and hemp — all organically sourced.

"Eat good foods, get plenty of air and exercise, and your body, mind and mental 'acuity' will thrive," Schade adds. "Being outside helps us feel grounded. Moving and exerting the body clears the head and invigorates both body and mind. The benefits are astounding. Yet it is also astounding that so many people are unable to fit this into their day."

## Fasting For Boosting Mental Clarity

The last of three investing tips may sound unusual. But Suresh Malhotra, a McLean, Va.-based physician in the field of gastroenterology for 32 years and an active stock investor, advocates the practice of intermittent fasting — 16 continuous hours without food each day. He suggests drinking plenty of water and zero-calorie beverages over that stretch of time, but no diet soda.

"During the fasting state, several hormonal changes occur," Malhotra told IBD. "Insulin levels drop. High insulin levels are linked to several diseases. Growth hormone also rises in fasting state, which is powerful in burning fat and building muscles."

Malhotra notes the fasting state "causes lower blood sugar and starts use of fat cells as an energy source, helping reduce body fat. It can cause higher mental clarity for optimum trading. Fasting also increases detoxification of cells. It reduces inflammation."

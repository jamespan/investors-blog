One of the critical keys to successful stock investing in the long run is knowing when to take profits. That means having a set of sell rules to help you get out of a stock before it loses its gains and even damages your portfolio.


Many investors use the 50-day or 10-week moving averages as barometers of a stock's health, selling when those lines are breached in heavy volume.


But short-term traders, or true followers of the [CAN SLIM investment system](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2) who feel skittish about current market conditions or a stock's prospects, can use the short-term 10-day moving average as the trigger to take profits.


Many charting services can allow you to draw the 10-day line. The line appears in green on daily charts in [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx).


In the Leaderboard feature, stocks that fall sharply below their 10-day lines are often flagged in the IBD charts as a sell signal when a gain of more than 10% is at risk of shrinking quickly.


**NXP Semiconductors** ([NXPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NXPI)) broke out past a 78.44 buy point of a base-on-base pattern in heavy volume on Jan. 9 this year. It got off to a slow start, going mostly sideways for a number of weeks. But it gapped up and soared 17% on March 2 after the company announced plans to buy **Freescale Semiconductor** ([FSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSL)).


The stock reached as high as 108.50 on March 23, representing a 38% profit from the 78.44 buy point. At that point, investors needed to consider the following: First, stocks tend to correct to form new bases after a gain of more than 20%. That's why IBD recommends that investors take at least some profits at that point.


Second, the market's uptrend had come under pressure, as indicated in the Market Pulse box that accompanied the [Big Picture Column on March 25](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/032515-745123-stocks-tumble-in-higher-trade-biotechs-chips-hit-hard.htm?ntt=biig+picture). On that day, NXP dropped 4%, piercing its 10-day line in volume that was 54% above average **(1)**.


The stock fell 14% and formed a flat base over the next nine weeks. It broke out past the 108.60 buy point on May 28 but quickly rolled over and plunged as much as 34% below the entry.


Investors who used the 10-day line as a sell signal for NXP were able to lock in a 28% gain or more. Those who had waited for a break of the longer-term 50-day line, which occurred on April 24 **(2)**, settled for a profit of 22% â€” still solid. Those who decided to hold onto the stock for the long term eventually lost all of their profits by Aug. 24. NXP is now forming a new base.


Of course, many stocks will recover after dropping below the 10-day moving average, digesting gains and moving on to new highs. As a result, short-term traders risk missing out on further gains if they use the 10-day line as their only sell signal.


Nevertheless, you'll never go wrong by following good sell rules. Use the Investor's Corner archives to learn and refresh your knowledge of other key sell rules, including the "Master This Sell Rule" series of 21 articles in June and July this year.


"If you don't sell early, you'll be late. Your object is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger," IBD Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How To Make Money In Stocks."

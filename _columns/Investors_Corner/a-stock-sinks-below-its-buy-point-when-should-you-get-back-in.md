  A Stock Sinks Below Its Buy Point; When Should You Get Back In?

It's perhaps just as easy to get bounced out of a high-growth stock as it is for a veteran cowhand to get knocked off the muscular back of an annoyed bronco.


Investing holds many parallels to human nature and the world we live in. How you respond to such an unpleasant experience may have a lot to do with how well you perform in growth stocks in the long run.


Have you ever bought a stock that had all the right attributes, saw it rise steadily to a double-digit gain, then were forced to sell for a tiny gain or break even as the stock plunged back to the proper buy point?


The experience can be especially frustrating for new investors who are following IBD's [time-proven system for selecting, buying and selling the best stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). Turn that frustration into determination. The beauty of stocks is that you are not penalized for buying a stock back. Your tennis partner doesn't have to know. Nor does your mother.


"There's something important to know about losing, above and beyond the lessons it teaches about winning. *After a loss, victory becomes more likely*. All good athletes know this maxim," the veteran global macro trader Victor Niederhoffer wrote in his investing classic "The Education of a Speculator."


" 'Watch the revenge factor' and 'Don't let up' are drummed into all players, in the Pee-Wee leagues and on up," Niederhoffer added.


The second time, or even the third time, that a stock with true market-leading potential breaks out may be the proverbial charm.


In some cases, a stock may give back all of its post-breakout gains, then take weeks to form a brand-new base. IBD calls such cycles of market behavior a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), or a base next to a base. In the former, the lows of the second base hold near the top of the first base. In the latter, the lows of the second base may be deep in the belly of the prior base.


Regardless of the pattern, always know this: The market can change direction as fast as the wind. So don't let feelings of anger, disappointment, disgust or frustration block you from making a fantastic second buy.


The mental strength needed to recommit capital into a wild horse in the equity markets paid off in **HealthEquity** ([HQY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HQY)).

On Aug. 29, 2016, the small-cap financial services firm broke out of a long cup with handle with a 31.79 buy point (10 cents above the six-week handle's 31.69 high), and appeared to have everything going for it. The Draper, Utah-based firm had these solid ratings: 98 Composite, 97 EPS, 82 RS. It went public in the summer of 2014 and was in our [IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) screen, a key feature not just at Investors.com but also in each IBD Weekly newspaper. HealthEquity is the only significant publicly traded company that offers investors a pure play in the emerging field of tax-advantaged health savings accounts.


In the span of just six weeks, HealthEquity's gain reached 22% and the stock hit 38.80 **(1)**. That advance triggered an IBD sell rule to take profits frequently at 20% to 25%. But in October, HealthEquity fell fast amid a teetering stock market. On Oct. 11, IBD's Market Pulse table, found in the [daily Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), noted a downgrade in the current market outlook to "Uptrend under pressure" from "Confirmed uptrend" after the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 got tagged with their fifth and eighth distribution days, respectively.


HealthEquity caught a bad cold. The stock dropped in 11 out of 12 sessions from Oct. 20 to Nov. 4 **(2)**. When HealthEquity cut through the 50-day moving average at 34.69 and failed to rebound quickly, a holder was forced to sell before the gain turned into a total loss.


But a 12% gain in heavy volume on Nov. 9 **(3)** right after the U.S. elections changed everything. If you had gotten out of the stock, it was the right time to get back in. HealthEquity still had great ratings from IBD. You had to act quickly and decisively. The stock closed that session at 34.95, 9.9% above the original buy point. Volume exploded to 2.1 million shares, 283% above average and the heaviest in more than a year.


However, one could have arguably bought back shares the next day on Nov. 10 as the member of IBD's outsourcing services industry group thrust back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since that Aug. 29 breakout.


As seen in the daily or weekly chart, the rebound was so fast that HealthEquity did not spend enough time to form a proper new base. A cup must be a minimum of six weeks, a flat base a minimum five weeks.

Rolling action in the stock market meant stock pickers had a tough time beating the indexes in 2013.

Yet, if you know how to use IBD, latching on to a big winner was entirely possible.

Studying such opportunities could help for years to come.

**Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) was one of the big winners of 2013. The stock has delivered a gain of more than 250% so far this year. Realistically, an investor can do quite well grabbing just a part of such a move.

Trying to pick a low or buying blindly at year-end aren't sound approaches. IBD doesn't pretend that a disciplined investor can get all of a stock's big move.

How much of Nu Skin's gain could an investor have caught by reading IBD and following sound rules? Quite a bit.

On April 22, IBD ran an article with this headline: "Is Nu Skin Set To Refire Fast EPS Growth?" The article pointed out two factors working in Nu Skin's favor.

First, the company was about to launch a weight-loss system to accompany its anti-aging products. Second, the company was finding fast growth in China.

For investors who put the stock on a watch list, the first opportunity to buy came in July.

On July 10, the stock gapped out of a flat base in volume 690% above average **(1)**.

Supersized volume points to institutions trading the stock. Nu Skin's average daily volume was about 820,000 shares, but the gap-up drew volume of 7.5 million.

Granted, the gap-up meant that no one could buy at the ideal buy point of 63.45, or even within a 5% buy zone. Yet, a gap-up is one of a few situations where an investor can buy 5% past a buy point.

Also, the market was in a correction, but an investor had only one day to wait for the July 11 follow-through. Nu Skin closed at 76.93 that day.

In subsequent months, the stock flashed no sell signals. An investor could've held the stock, adding shares at pullbacks to the 10-week moving average in September and **October (2).**

The gain from 76.93 at this point is more than 75%. Adding shares on the way up would've lowered the percentage gain while adding to the overall profit in dollars.

If an investor had been concentrating a portfolio on four or five strong stocks, Nu Skin could've boosted an investor's portfolio big time in 2013.

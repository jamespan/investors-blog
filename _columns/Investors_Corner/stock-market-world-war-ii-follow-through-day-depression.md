  Bull Market Began In Darkest Days Of World War II

The phrase "it is darkest before the dawn" is used so often, it's become a cliche.


But maybe it's repeated so often because there's truth to it, especially in the stock market.


Experienced investors know that the stock market turns up, often explosively, when the situation appears to be at its worst. That was true during the darkest days of World War II.


The U.S. had just gone through the Great Depression, the worst and longest economic downturn of the 20th century.


The stock market crashed Oct. 29, 1929, as the Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly half its value in a few weeks and continued sinking for months.


By 1933, the unemployment rate stood at nearly 25%. A second downturn in the economy took the market down again in 1937. By 1939, the unemployment rate was still 17%.


Germany invaded Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, launching WWII in Europe. At first, the Dow didn't react much. Many people expected the U.S. to stay out. But when Hitler invaded France in May 1940, the market got hammered **(1)**. Over an eight-day period, it fell 23%. It rallied after that, but the worst was yet to come.


The market was already in a serious decline, which had begun in the summer of 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Sunday, Dec. 7 **(2)**.


The Dow fell 3% on Dec. 8 and another 3% the next day. The Dow hit 92.69, its lowest level since 1934, on April 28, 1942.


Then the market turned. There seems to have been no single event that triggered it.


It was, perhaps, the realization among investors that the U.S. was fully mobilizing for war and would eventually win. The Federal Reserve dropped interest rates to nearly zero.


On May 7, 1942, the Dow rose 1.06 to 97.77, a gain of 1.1%, in volume greater than the day before. That 1% rally was enough for a follow-through day, a confirmation of the rally attempt. It occurred on the seventh day of the rally.


Additional high-volume days came on May 21, with the Dow up over 1%, and again on May 27.


That was the beginning of a bull market that carried the Dow up 130% in four years.


At the end of the war in 1945, the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates, and the market slumped into a correction. But the great postwar boom was on.

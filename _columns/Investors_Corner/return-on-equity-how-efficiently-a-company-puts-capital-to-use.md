No, it ain’t fish eggs. Instead, ROE means return on equity -- or more accurately, return on shareholders' equity.


The gauge divides a company’s full-year net income by its shareholders' equity, then multiplies by 100 to get a percentage figure. IBD takes the average equity over the past two years. The result expresses how much profit it can generate for every dollar of net assets. IBD research into past big market winners shows a ratio of 17% or more as positive. Single-digit ratios could be cause for concern.


ROE is a rough gauge for how efficiently management is putting capital to use and how its profitability is keeping pace with its growth as a publicly traded company.  As a company's equity grows, so does the challenge to maintain a high ROE. Earnings per share is another measure that weighs in on this question of ownership vs. profitability. But ROE does not take the number of shares into account.


Where do you find it? Get a stock quote by using the search box at the top right corner of Investors.com. Under Stock/Company Data, you will find Annual ROE in the Company Fundamentals column. In addition, the minicharts presented with IBD’s Big Cap 20, Your Weekly Review and IBD 50 include ROE.

Some companies often borrow debt to invest in new products and services to drive more profit. As a result, companies with high ROE sometimes also have somewhat elevated levels of debt.


So as you perform your stock research, look at peer companies and compare their debt and ROE levels. If a target stock has a higher than group average ROE, and its debt is moderately higher, the two could be related.


To be sure, a high ROE doesn’t compensate for unhealthy levels of debt. A long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 100% or more is considered high, even in certain industries known for heavy capital spending.


If a stock has a low ROE (single digits and/or well below its group average) and very high debt, it could be a cause for concern.


There is also a relationship between profit margins and return on equity. In some cases, you might allow for a below-peer ROE, if the company is churning out top-notch annual pretax margins. In general, annual pretax margin of 17% or higher is a sign of fundamental strength. You also want to see if a company's pretax margin is among the best in its industry.


The average return on equity among current IBD 50 stocks is 28.4%. At the high end of the scale among companies that have thus far reported 2015 results, **Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) shows an unusually strong return on equity of 52.3%.


That is well above peers like **J.M. Smucker** ([SJM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SJM)), with ROE of 7.2%, and even much larger players such as **Kellogg** ([K](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=K)), **General Mills** ([GIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GIS)) and **Kraft Heinz** ([KHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KHC)).


Campbell’s pretax margins, 13.1% in fiscal 2015, are in line with these other food giants. Its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 185% is certainly on the high side. It helps boost Campbell's ROE above a company like Smucker, which shows a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 84%.

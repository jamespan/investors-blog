History has a habit of repeating itself in the stock market. Just look at past market bubbles.


They always start the same as a herd mentality pushes prices higher, creating newfound wealth. They end the same way, too, when the bubble pops and wealth disappears. Easy come, easy go.


One thing's for certain: Price and volume in the major averages are your best guide as to when a stock market bubble is about to burst. When this happens, cash is the best place for your portfolio.


That's why monitoring distribution days in the major averages and sell signals in leading stocks is so important. Use [The Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) and Market Pulse as your daily guide.


One of the earliest bubbles was the tulip craze in the Netherlands in the 1630s. There was the stock-market bubble in the 1920s that eventually led to the Great Depression; the economic bubble in Japan from 1986 to 1991; the U.S. tech bubble in 2000 and the U.S. housing bubble, which ultimately collapsed in 2006 and 2007.


In the late 1990s, just before the tech bubble burst, an unprecedented 53% of American adults held investments in the stock market, according to "Pop Finance," and headlines were getting a bit sensational. At the time, a New York Times headline proclaimed "a new era of shareholder democracy." Indeed, headlines can become hyperboles as a bubble takes shape.


In the late '90s, IPOs doubled and tripled in price on their first day of trading â€” many without earnings. Speculation was excessive, prompting Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to use the term "irrational exuberance." Of course, the euphoria came to an end when the bubble popped in 2000 and prices started falling. **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) fell 56% in September 2000 alone.


Fast forward to today and there's growing talk about a bubble in the online currency Bitcoin. In January, the Bitcoin was worth \$13. Earlier this month, it was trading around \$1,240.


Just recently, a Noble prize-winning economist recently warned of a U.S. stock market bubble. Others talk about recent frothiness in the IPO market as a sign of a possible bubble.


It's true that the Fed's easy-money policy has been a boon for the stock market and 401(k) statements. But to say speculation has been excessive is a stretch. The stock market is not a topic of conversation like it was at cocktail parties in the late '90s.

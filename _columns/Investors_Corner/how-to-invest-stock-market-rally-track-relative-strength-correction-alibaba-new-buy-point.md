One of the best ways to identify the leading stocks during stock market corrections — and new uptrends — is to use the relative strength line.

During stock market corrections, it can be easy to make the mistake of tuning out the daily market action. After all, the stock market isn't going up, so what's the worst that could happen? Well, you could miss some of the next uptrend's biggest winners. They typically break out on the [follow-through rally confirmation day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) or shortly thereafter.

As it turns out, you can find many of the next uptrend's leaders while the market is still correcting, which can be done by using the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, then the RS line angles upward. If a stock is performing worse than the broad market, then the line will point lower.

The RS line is the blue line on all [IBD Charts](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY) as well as in [MarketSurge](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge).

Some of the best potential leaders will have RS lines that snap back after weeks of being dormant, as the market starts to turn upward. For example, **Twilio**'s ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) RS line surged to new highs on Oct. 2, 2020, after the [company forecast strong sales growth.](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/twilio-stock-jumps-bullish-investor-day-presentation/)

Shares broke out above a 283.34 entry in a double bottom. The strong RS line suggested this could be a winning breakout. Indeed it was, as shares rose 21% in less than two weeks.

Other stocks will have RS lines that flatten during tough market environments, instead of trending downward. This indicates the stock is correcting in line with the broad market, instead of underperforming. When the market shifts back into an uptrend, the stock is in better shape to rally higher.

The RS line barely moved lower during the short correction **(2)**. Then, the RS line went to new highs, as the stock tried to break out past a 299 entry in new flat base. In this case, the stock rose only 7% before rolling over.

The RS line also made new highs in July, when Alibaba broke out of another base. The stock climbed 16% until it started its next base.

## 'Blue Dot' Specials: LGI Homes, ServiceNow

MarketSmith's RS Line Blue Dot feature combines the relative strength line with [MarketSmith Pattern Recognition](https://marketsmith.investors.com/patternrecognition/). When a stock's RS line hits a new high while the stock is [forming a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) or [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), the Blue Dot appears on the MarketSmith daily or weekly chart.

Here's an example of a Blue Dot signal: In May 2020, **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) broke out of cup without handle base as the RS line reached new highs. The stock surged as much as 65% from the 362.95 buy point to its February peak.

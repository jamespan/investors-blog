Chart readers know that a W-shaped base is called a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/) in top growth stocks before they [break out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). So why did current market leader **RealPage** ([RP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RP)), whose daily chart showed exactly that type of shape last year, actually form a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/)?

The reason and proper interpretation lies not just in the [shape of the base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) but its overall dimensions. Identifying those will help you tell the difference between a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and an improper buy point.

The Nasdaq composite rebounded from a few sharp pullbacks of as much as 12% in the first three quarters of 2018. Many stocks shadowed those price moves. That explains why so many leading stocks formed bases with two distinct lows, the [hallmark of double-bottom bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/).

**Evercore** ([EVR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVR)), formerly a [member of the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), is one stock that climbed nicely — for a while — from a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) that formed from February to April in 2018.

Shares broke out past a 99.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on April 25, then rallied as much as 17.7% before losing support at the 50-day moving average in August — [a key sell signal](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).

## Growth Stocks And The Correct Shape Of This Base

[A double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) not only must have two clear lows, but the second must undercut the first. This tells investors there's been a second shakeout of weak holders. From the start of the pattern, at least seven weeks must pass before a viable buy point emerges.

The [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) is found by locating the middle peak in the base and adding 10 cents. That price should be in the upper half of the base.

Back to the original question, why are some bases that look exactly that way considered [flat bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/)? The key distinction is in the depth of these two types of patterns.

Double bottoms normally decline as much as 33% from top to lowest point.

By comparison, flat bases are shallower — less than 15% in depth.

Another difference is that flat bases can form in as few as five weeks.

RealPage had a total decline of 13% from the base's left-side peak of 54.95, which made it a [legitimate flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).

The specialty enterprise software group member broke out on May 4, gained nearly 13% in just three days, then formed a new flat base. This new pattern presented a 62.05 [correct entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

## In Top Growth Stocks, Mild Selling In A Double Bottom Is Also Good

**Zebra Tech** ([ZBRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZBRA)), the inventory tracking technology company, also had two distinct lows in its March-to-early-May base in 2018.

But it wasn't deep enough for a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). The stock corrected only 12% and was better interpreted as a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/).

This raises another question: In a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) that resembles a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/), can the middle peak be used as a proper buy point? Normally, no. A flat base is already shallow enough, so the surest entry is when the stock makes a new high.

But in some cases, an early entry can be identified in a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). In Zebra's case, 146.80 could have been used as a perfectly acceptable alternative entry. That's a dime above the April 18 intraday high of 146.70.

The stock surged past that level (and the prior high) on May 8 in heavy volume following an earnings report. There was little doubt that the lower entry was just as good as the higher.

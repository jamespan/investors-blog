**Handling A Choppy Uptrend:**Â *[Second In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/621258/201208071356/handling-a-choppy-uptrend.aspx)*

Volatility is good at times, but remember that it cuts both ways.

Dividend-paying stocks tend to have less wild ups and downs on a daily basis, even in choppy markets. If you prefer to see smaller swings in your portfolio in a choppy market, consider owning a few income stocks with CAN SLIM traits.

While dividends should not be a primary factor for selecting stocks, they can enhance total return. As IBD's Income Investor column shows (today on B10), some companies that dole out dividends also reveal decent growth characteristics.

Stocks that pay dividends tend to come from slower-growing, more defensive industries. These include food, beverage and tobacco companies. Electric utilities and natural gas providers are also known to return cash to shareholders through dividends.

Companies in faster-growing industries tend to use cash from retained earnings to develop new products and services rather than pay cash to shareholders.

But those in more mature and lower-growth reward shareholders by returning cash to them.

Master limited partnerships (MLPs) and real estate investment trust (REITs) are also regular dividend payers. Companies structured as an MLP or REIT must pay out a certain percentage of their taxable income to shareholders.

MLPs are often engaged in mining or oil and gas operations. Although they tend to pay high yields, they can also be quite volatile at times due to swinging commodity prices.

Investors can find highly rated, dividend-paying stocks in buy setups in The Income Investor column or the Big Cap 20.

**B&G Foods** ([BGS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BGS)) was featured in May 17's Income Investor. The maker of Cream of Wheat, Ortega Salsa and other shelf-stable items had delivered double-digit profit growth in the past few years.

The company raised its payout three times in 2011, boosting the stock's annualized yield to 4.7%.

At the time, B&G Foods etched a long saucer with a 24.74 buy point. The stock was in a four-point range for six months. It had a beta of 0.94, signaling that it had less volatility than the S&P 500.

B&G broke out from the long base in the week ended June 8 **1** in heavy volume. It's gained 16%.

There have been plenty of times to buy the [FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/fang-stocks-news-quotes-facebook-amazon-netflix-google/) Amazon.com during its impressive price run — when it cleared an [early-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) in April 2015; when it broke out of a [later-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/do-you-know-how-to-count-bases-in-leading-stocks-do-it-to-assess-risk/) in April 2016; and when it cleared a [late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/) in April 2018.

But after an eye-popping price gain and some technology stocks under recent selling pressure, holders of **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) with a nice profit should be asking the question: Is it time to lock in gains?

Indeed, the reasons for [taking partial or full profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) at this point are starting to mount — at least from a technical perspective.

For starters, after the April 2015 breakout, Amazon [never reset its base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/). That means the lows of the numerous bases that followed never undercut the lows of prior bases. When the low of a base undercuts the low of a prior base, it's usually enough to wipe the slate clean of sellers and [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/). That hasn't happened yet.![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/wIC_amzn091918-300x278.jpg)

## Top FANG Stock: Signs Of Institutional Selling

A recent [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of D-, as seen in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx), gives pause. The rating measures institutional buying and selling in a stock on an A+ to E scale. A+ indicates heavy net institutional buying, while E means unusually heavy institutional selling. Amazon's rating was hurt recently by several higher-volume declines starting in early September. The declines coincided with [four distribution days in the Nasdaq](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) from Sept. 4 to Sept. 17.

A weak Accumulation Rating isn't reason alone to sell a stock. Longtime holders of Amazon stock don't need to head for the hills yet, especially as the stock holds above the 50-day moving average (daily chart) and the 10-week moving average (weekly chart).

Keep in mind that Amazon's last breakout in April yielded a gain of more than 25%, triggering an [IBD sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) that says to generally take a 20% to 25% gain if you have it. Why? Because that's the time a stock will usually pause and consolidate gains.

For those still holding with a sizable gain, a good game plan from here is to continue to watch for signs of institutional selling. A break of the 10-week line in big volume certainly would be reason to take at least partial profits. For those who bought Amazon stock at the April breakout, taking full profits would also be sound strategy. Also remember that when a true leader [breaches its 10-week line and starts to live underneath it](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-rule-is-the-stock-living-beneath-the-10-week-line/), price action like this can often presage more weakness.

## Another Key Sell Signal To Watch

If Amazon breaks support in heavy volume, watch to see how the stock reacts from there. A rally attempt in light volume would be a sign that buying demand is drying up. [Heavy-volume declines followed by low-volume rallies](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-sell-signal-weak-rebound-action-after-violating-the-50-day-line/) can often presage more price weakness.

Make no mistake. Amazon still boasts compelling fundamentals. Even with a market capitalization north of \$900 million, the Nasdaq 100 bellwether continues to churn out impressive growth. Sales growth, for example, has averaged 38% over the past four quarters. [Annual earnings estimates](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/annual-earnings/) are also robust, with growth of 284% expected this year and 46% growth in 2019.

Still, current holders with a nice gain have plenty of reasons to be playing defense. New buyers would be well served to wait for a good shakeout and a first-stage base.

The stock market's big benchmarks fell below their 50-day moving averages this month, while many leading stocks also broke below those lines.




It's a good time for investors to wrap their heads around the importance of the 50-day moving average, a crucial tool used by [institutional investors](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) to move in and out of stocks, ETFs and commodities. This also makes it an influential level of support or resistance for stock market indexes.


On the charts at [Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/) and [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), the 50-day line (or the 10-week line, on a weekly chart) is a red line over the price bars. Don't confuse that with the blue [relative price strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) (traced in blue), or with the 200-day and 40-week moving averages, which are typically shown in black.


The 50-day line smooths out the price action. It tracks a running average of price closes over the past 50 trading sessions. On a weekly chart, the 10-week moving average is nearly the same, but averages closing prices over the prior 10 weeks.

The 50-Day Line: A Crucial Stock Market Tool
--------------------------------------------


The 50-day line is a simple moving average, or SMA for short. This means it weighs all 50 closing prices equally. An exponential index, like the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), places higher weighting on the most recent closing prices.


Institutional investors often use the 50-day line as a buy or sell boundary.


When a stock is rising and gets stopped at the line, it could be time to [take profits](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/sell-and-take-profits-or-hold-here-are-several-guidelines-to-follow/). This type of action tells you the stock or index is meeting resistance. A stock that breaks above that resistance often extends its advance.


This was the case for **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) back in June 2021, when it climbed above the 10-week line above support in late June. The stock had fallen as much 40%, and the strong move above the line acted as an aggressive entry.


After a breakout from a base, leading stocks tend to trade above the 50-day and 10-week average. Often, they'll pull back to the line and rebound from there. That creates a good opportunity to "buy on the dip."

This demonstrates that the stock is finding institutional support.


For example, **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) broke out of a cup with handle base in June 2021, and the next month pulled back to the 10-week line. The stock found support in a bullish reversal in higher volume, which added more than 100% to InMode's advance.


A break below this level in heavy volume suggests at least some big investors are stepping back from the stock. This is usually a sell signal when it happens after a stock has been rising from a breakout.


Using The 50-Day To Gauge Indexes
---------------------------------


These general guidelines also apply to stock market indexes. In addition, they work as a gauge for trading ETFs.


Moves sharply below 50-day support indicate stocks or indexes are headed to prior lows. This was the case with the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which fell below the 50-day lines last week.

"Basic research" is one of the easiest to say, toughest to do terms in the investment lexicon.

The term includes researching a stock's fundamentals, understanding a company's products, markets, and quality of management, then placing those factors in the context of other companies in the industry.

It takes time. And investors must climb a steep learning curve in order to nail down resources and develop a routine to efficiently study and understand the stocks on their watch lists before making a decision, pulling the trigger and buying in during a breakout.

Time and accuracy of information are both critical factors. Investors.com is clued in to the challenge.

To get started, type a stock ticker into the search window at [Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/default.aspx). Click on Get Quote.

You'll receive a basic read on fundamentals, a comprehensive stock chart, and a list of the top-ranked leaders in the stock's industry group.

Below that, you'll find a list of news articles related to the company from Investors.com and Investor's Business Daily. Below that are news from IBD partners, as well as regulatory filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

At the bottom of each segment, a "View All" link allows you to click back through years of news reports on the company. Want to know why the stock dived in May? Just scan back through news items until you reach the date. Was there any news that drove shares to form a bottom and turn up into its recent uptrend? Scan the news.

**Stratasys** ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) provides a good example. The stock began separate rallies in January 2010 and in April 2012. In either case, investors could trace IBD articles on the company back to 2003.

An IBD brief detailed the company's surge after notching an agreement with **Hewlett-Packard** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) in January 2010.

The Big Picture caught the stock's 17% jump on Q3 earnings that year on Oct. 26. The Big Picture article traced most of its climb during this rally.

A May 6, 2011, the Internet & Technology article explored the potential of the three-dimensional printing market, explaining that the technology was beginning to see "pervasive adoption" by consumers and companies.

An April 20, 2012, Industry Themes article reported Stratasys' huge jump following news it had acquired Israel-based Objet. The move launched the stock's current rally, even though the market was in a correction.

Coverage also includes New America, Industry Snapshot and the Stock Spotlight articles tracing the stock through its run, including an Aug. 15 piece discussing late-stage base challenges facing Stratasys and peer **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)).

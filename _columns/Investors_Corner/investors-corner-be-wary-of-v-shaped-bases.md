Buyer beware. Know what you're getting into before you get into it. That goes for many things in life as well as stock trading.

  

When scouting bases, watch out for flaws that can sometimes make or break a trade. Cup patterns that are V-shaped can be more failure-prone.

  

On the surface, a V-shaped structure may seem good. After all, in such a pattern a stock promptly rebounds after a sharp sell-off. That's good action and it's showing strength, right? Not exactly.

  

Think of it this way. During a 40-yard dash, a runner breaks his ankle. Do you want him to get right up and continue running? Or get back into intense training the next day or two? No, you'd want to him to take time off and recover first. Let the ankle heal before getting back on the track.

  

You want to see the similar situation after a stock stumbles. Give it time to consolidate. Let it shake out the weak holders and build a better foundation. Remember, a proper cup without handle must be at least six weeks and a cup with handle, seven weeks. A handle must be at least one week long.

  

Focus on cups that are more U-shaped, as these let a stock to go through a more constructive consolidating period. Check out the first chapter of "How to Make Money in Stocks" or the education section of Investors.com to see excellent examples of such patterns.

Top stocks either act right after a breakout or they don't. One way a stock acts the way it should is by following through, or extending gains after the initial breakout. Another way is to move sideways after [the breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), refusing to give back bullish gains.




There's one more way a stock acts right after a breakout.


On a daily chart, it pulls back to the 50-day moving average in light volume, followed by a bounce off the line with conviction. That's called a bullish first test of the 50-day line. On a weekly chart, it's a first test of the 10-week moving average. Either way, it provides an opportunity to add shares to a current position — or buy the stock for the first time — especially since it's an area where institutional investors like to buy.


How Top Stocks Find Support
---------------------------


But remember this key point. There's a difference between testing support and finding support. If a stock falls hard to the 50-day line and holds above the line, it's still a test. An example of support would be if the stock fell hard to the line, then reversed higher in strong volume.


The 50-day line is plotted on a daily chart. The 10-week line is found on the weekly chart.


To determine whether or not a stock is finding support, both time frames should be used.

In some cases, a stock might be holding above its 50-day moving average, but it might be slightly below the 10-week line. But generally speaking, a bounce with conviction off the 50-day line should tell a similar story on the weekly chart.


Coupa's Bounces Off Support Levels
----------------------------------


Coupa Software, an enterprise software leader at the time, found support around its 50-day line after a breakout from a [deep cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-basics-dont-dismiss-all-deep-cup-with-handle-bases/) in January 2019.


Investors who bought at the breakout could've added shares in late April **(1)** when the stock rallied back above the 50-day line.


In early June, the [Leaderboard stock](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) bounced off the line again in strong volume **(2)** after reporting earnings. (Coupa was acquired by investment firm Thoma Bravo in February 2023 and is no longer a publicly traded company.)


In a confirmed market uptrend, investors will find multiple market leaders testing support or finding support at their 10-week lines. One way to find them is to check the stock analysis printed on each IBD 50 and Big Cap 20 chart in IBD Weekly.

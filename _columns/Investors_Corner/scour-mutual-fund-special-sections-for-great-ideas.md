Institutional sponsorship is a key factor to check when researching stocks to buy. Why?

Without demand from mutual funds, hedge funds and other big investors, which account for most of the market's daily activity, a stock cannot keep advancing. That's why institutions are the "I" in [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/).

Even if a stock boasts strong fundamentals and shows solid price and volume action on its charts, the big money should have a presence.

"If a stock has no professional sponsorship, chances are that its performance will be more run-of-the-mill, as this means that at least some of the more than 10,000 institutional investors have looked at the stock and passed over it," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

Since fund managers get paid to select stocks, they devote much of their time to researching companies. Those who run growth funds tend to favor stocks that are leaders in their fields, and you should too.

That's where the "L" comes in: Is the stock you're eyeing a leader or a laggard? Savvy investors favor the best two or three stocks in a strong industry group, since they often have strong growth potential.

Managers also look for the "N," the "new" factor. Be it new products, new management, new industry conditions or a new high, that change could spark a big run-up in a leading stock.

You can also get an in-depth look at what stocks and sectors a top-performing fund manager favors and how he or she selects holdings in the Mutual Fund Monthly and Quarterly special sections (see the latest one in the Nov. 5 IBD).

In the special report section, you'll also find tables of stocks that top-performing mutual funds have been buying or selling. The data include the number of leading funds buying and how much they're putting to work.

Look at stocks that these funds have been snapping up as potential watch list candidates. If the pros like them, they're probably worth a closer look.

Likewise, when fund managers are dumping shares of a particular company, that's a red flag. Aggressive selling by the big money can push a stock's price down. So it's helpful to pay attention to which stocks the funds are unloading, too.

You can find this data in the Mutual Fund special section tables mentioned above, too. For instance, the Top Funds' Latest Sells was published on Page A8 in the October special that ran in the Nov. 5 issue. **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Weyerhaeuser** ([WY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WY)) and **Express Scripts** ([ESRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESRX)) showed up at the top of the list.

But don't sell stocks just because they show up on the list. Conduct some due diligence first. A fund could be selling some shares simply to reduce exposure to a certain sector or stock, not because it's concerned about slowing earnings or sales, or some other potential drag.

Among top buys in last month's special section, **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) was a major purchase by top funds during the third quarter. Twenty funds invested a total of \$81 million in the action-camera maker. The stock, which went public June 26, broke out past an [IPO](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm) base buy point of 50 on Aug. 29. It triggered the eight-week hold rule on its way up to a 97% gain.

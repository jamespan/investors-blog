A [sell signal](http://education.investors.com/ibd-university/451104-sell-signals.aspx?nav=IBDUCourse4) that triggers on price weakness is not the only time to sell a stock. Sometimes, it's just time to let a good stock go.

  

In most cases, investors who follow IBD rules sell because they have to. For example, they sell to cut losses short, or when a stock gives topping signals.

  

Other times, a stock doesn't flash sell signals at all, but the gain from the correct buy point is large enough that it makes sense to take profits.

  

A gain of 20% to 25% from the proper entry point is an attractive profit-taking target for most growth stocks.

  

Research shows that in general, stocks will rise that much from a base breakout before they start forming the next base. ( Subscribers to IBD's [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) product often see a 20% target marked for breakouts.)

  

Granted, there's the chance you could be settling for a tidy profit only to miss out on even larger profits. One way to guard against that is to measure how fast a stock climbs from its breakout.

  

In unusual cases, stocks reach a 20% profit in less than two or three weeks. These are exceptional gains and a sign the stock could be a big winner. Therefore, any stock that surges that fast in three weeks or less should be held at least eight weeks. After that, observe how the stock behaves.

  

Another reason to take sensible profits is a simple matter of portfolio management.

  

You need to have some cash available to buy other top stocks emerging from [sound bases](http://education.investors.com/ibd-university/452143-451682-charting-the-course-base-patterns-part-i.aspx). If all your funds are tied up in a handful of stocks, you'd have to watch helplessly as shares catch fire.

  

A few 20% gains can make a big difference in your portfolio at the end of the year, provided you've cut losses short in the stocks that don't pan out for you.

  

And if you have strong convictions about a stock, you always have the option to take profits and buy on the next breakout or follow-on buy area.

  

There is one case when a stock on the way up is flashing a sure-fire sell signal: when a [climax top](http://education.investors.com/ibd-university/451104-451079-sell-signals-climax-runs.aspx) forms. After a prolonged advance, shares soar 25% to 50% or more in three weeks or less. That's the hallmark of a climax top.

  

The value of taking profits was exemplified in **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)) last year. Toyota, riding a turnaround at the time, broke out of a [flat base](http://education.investors.com/ibd-university/452143-451713-charting-the-course-base-patterns-part-ii.aspx) with a 106.10 buy point on April 5. By May 17, the Japanese automaker had advanced 20%, and shareholders could take their profits near 127 1.

  

A few days later, on May 22, Toyota peaked 2. In three days, shares were off as much as 9% from their top and off 14% in two weeks. No other sell signals triggered. Toyota simply went on to make a new base.

  

Those who took profits at 20% or shortly after that target walked away with a satisfying gain and sidestepped the May sell-off entirely. Since then, the stock has caved below the 40-week moving average and back near the original 106.10 entry.

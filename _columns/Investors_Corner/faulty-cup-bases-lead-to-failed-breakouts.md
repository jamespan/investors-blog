  Jagged Cup Base May Be Sign Stock Is About To Crack

A perfectly shaped cup base looks smooth and symmetrical, like a tea cup. But a crack in the pattern can let your hard-earned money drain away.


A faulty base is a warning sign that your stock could fail no matter how great its fundamentals. That's because the shape of cups and other bases is determined mainly by the buying and selling actions of institutional investors, who ultimately determine a stock's fate.


**Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)) had respectable fundamentals when it broke out of a cup base on April 12, 2004. Also, the pattern was 20% deep, within the desirable range for cup bases.


Yet the stock rolled over soon after it cleared the buy point at 22, crashing through its 10-week line in double its average weekly volume. Along the way, the stock fell 8% below the entry, triggering a sell rule.


A close look at Align's chart would have revealed several flaws. As mentioned above, a cup base should be smooth and symmetrical, with the left side of the pattern as close as possible to a mirror image of the right.


But Align's cup was V-shaped and lopsided, with eight straight weekly declines on the left side **(1)** followed by only three weeks up on the right. Breakouts that occur when a stock shoots straight up from deep in a base to new highs are especially prone to failure.


Volume on the downside of the cup **(2)** was higher than on the upside, indicating big funds lacked enthusiasm as the stock neared the buy point.


Another risk factor was that Align's base had formed after the stock had already enjoyed a sharp run-up. Such later-stage bases have a lower chance of success.


Finally, there's the market. Few stocks can withstand a correction, least of all those with flaws. Align's sell-off picked up speed as the major averages corrected in late April. But Align never recovered even after the market uptrend resumed in late May.


Align ended 2004 at 10.75, 53% below its April 19 peak of 22.81.


Other flaws to watch for include wide-and-loose action, including weekly swings of, say, more than 10% from a stock's weekly high to its low. Big swings indicate a battle is raging between buyers and sellers.


Also, a flagging Relative Strength line indicates that the stock is underperforming the overall market. Ideally, a stock's RS line should be hitting new highs as it breaks out.

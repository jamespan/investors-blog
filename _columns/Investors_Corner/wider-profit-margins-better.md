**Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) slumped 6% on Aug. 4 in massive volume despite reporting another strong quarter of double-digit profit and sales growth.

The culprit? Worries about the company's profit margins.

Why are profit margins so key?

They measure how much a company actually makes out of every dollar in sales. It's displayed as a percentage. For instance: If a company has a 22% profit margin, then it nets 22 cents per dollar of sales.

Let's say that it costs a company \$50 to manufacture a purse. If the manufacturer sells purses for \$100 each, then he or she keeps \$50 per purse as net income. That's a profit margin of 50% before tax.

But if he/she sells purses for \$25 each, then he or she is losing \$25 per purse. There's no profit, or a 0% margin.

The less it costs to produce goods, generally the higher the profit margin. Thus many U.S. companies have shifted production to China, India and other overseas countries, where labor costs are typically much lower than in the U.S.

But strong margins can also come from a company's outstanding pricing power.

**Comparing Apples To Apples**

Profit margins can vary widely by industry. Grocery stores are infamous for having razor-thin margins, for instance.

Taking **Kroger**'s ([KR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KR)) 1.7% after-tax margin and comparing it with **Facebook**'s ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) 37.5% in their latest reported quarters isn't a fair comparison. Look at profit margins for companies in the same industry.

Markdowns can affect profit margins, particularly in the retail space. The more that a company has to slash prices to sell an item, the lower its profit margin.

This is what Kors is contending with. The Hong Kong-based company has been rapidly expanding â€” but it's also had to mark down prices on some of its affordable luxury goods. Kors expects second-quarter retail gross margins to fall 50 basis points.

The stock fell 4% to breach its 200-day moving average on July 14, followed by a 7% drop as analysts lowered their price targets due to margin-related concerns.

Where can you find profit-margin data? IBD looks at a company's quarterly and annual pretax and after-tax profit margins. You can find a company's latest annual pretax margin in our Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Income Investor charts, just above the stock graph. It's also available online in IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Or you can calculate net profit margin from a company's income statement by taking net income and dividing it by sales.

To help readers save time, IBD offers its SMR Rating, a proprietary gauge that takes into an account a company's sales, profit margin and return on equity.

Stocks are assigned a letter grade from A to E, with A being the best. Investors should focus on those that earn an A or B.

The table above lists stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or better, Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings of 90 or higher, average trading volume of at least 400,000 and a profit margin of 10% or more. They're ranked by the biggest profit margin in the last reported quarter.

Not surprisingly, you'll find a lot of familiar names. And all boast an A SMR Rating.

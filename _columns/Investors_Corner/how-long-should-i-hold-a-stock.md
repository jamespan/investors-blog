  IBD's Special 8-Week Hold Rule Has Faced Tough 2014

When a stock gains 20% in the first two to three weeks or less after a breakout, an IBD rule is triggered.


The rule is to hold the stock for eight weeks from the breakout and then evaluate the stock.


Normally, an individual investor should take profits after a 20% gain. However, when the gain comes quickly, the stock is doing something that big winners often do.


**Holding For The Big One**


Of course, if the stock starts to fall apart during the eight weeks, the investor should sell. Letting a substantial gain turn into a loss can damage a trader's psychology. Yet the idea of the hold rule is to avoid selling those stocks that act right after the swift 20% gain and could deliver huge gains.


However, no stock operates in a vacuum. The condition of the stock market matters. And the kind of uptrend also matters.


In recent cycles, the market hasn't pulled back much. Advances also have been of the steady and modest variety.


In other words, this isn't the ideal environment for truly big gains.


**Every Year Is Different**


How has the hold rule fared under this year's conditions?


A search for stocks — those breaking out from January through May with a Composite Rating of 90 or better and then advancing 20% in three weeks or less — turned up eight candidates. (More recent cases, such as **Restoration Hardware** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)), weren't included because it's too early to determine the outcome.)


Here's what happened to the eight:


**Vipshop** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)), up 20% in 15 days, then fell to 3% above the entry, which would have tested a shareholder. After the dip, the expert in online flash sales in China advanced to 99% above the entry in two months.


**Trinity Industries** ([TRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TRN)), up 20% in 11 days, then pulled back to 10% above the ideal entry in a three-weeks-tight pattern. This was not a hard hold. The stock rose to 57% above the buy point in five months.


**Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), up 20% in 14 days, then fell to 12% above the entry. The stock rose to 32% above the entry in two months but selling on the 50-day line violation would've netted just a 17% gain.


**Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), up 20% in 11 days, peaked the next day at 42% above the entry. By the time the decline sent Tesla below its 50-day moving average, the gain in the all-electric vehicle maker was 14%.


**Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) stock, up 20% in four days, peaked the next day at 34% above the entry. The stock then slid hard, wiping out the entire gain in the next three weeks.


**Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)), up 20% in six days but peaked four sessions later at 35% above the entry. After the peak, it took 11 sessions to wipe out all of the gain.


**YY** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)), up 20% in nine days or 28% in 11 days, lost all of the gain by five sessions later. After two bounces off the 50-day line, the stock advanced to 60% above the original buy point in two months.


**RetailMeNot** ([SALE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SALE)), up 23% in 13 days, fell the next day, eventually dropping to a 58% loss in six months.


Aside from Trinity and Valeant, most quick gainers this year have been tough to play.

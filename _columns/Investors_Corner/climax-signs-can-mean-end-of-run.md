  Climax Action Can Signal Implosion Ahead

It's sad, but true. Good things don't last forever.


In the market, stocks can have monster runs that go on for months or more. But when these massive rallies come to an end, they typically do so in dramatic fashion.


Just look at past winners **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) and **MasterCard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)). After skyrocketing 431% in 59 weeks, shares of the shoemaker plunged 99%. MasterCard dived 65% after charging up 565% in 95 weeks.


If you caught a major winner through hard work or was just lucky, the worst thing that you can do is to give back those gains. So when things start to get crazy, you don't have to sell right away. But you should start to get cautious and start watching out for signs of climactic activity.


Not all stocks top this way. But when they do, investors should be prepared.


Climax tops sometimes occur after a stock has been rallying for many months, usually at least 18 weeks after breaking out from a sound base. After such a long advance, take notice if gains suddenly accelerate. A climax top may be on the horizon.


One sign of climax action may not be enough to end a stock's run, but watch out when several signs start to appear.


•Exhaustion gaps. After a long run, a stock opens above the prior day's high. Such exhaustion gaps are usually a sign of strength and they are welcomed at the start of a breakout, but not at the latter stages of the game. There may be a series of these before a stock finally caves in.


•Largest daily point increase. After an extended run, a stock that stages its biggest one-day point gain since the beginning of the move may be close to peaking.


•Heaviest-volume day. A stock's top can occur on the day that it trades the most shares since the start of the run.


•Consecutive up days. A stock goes straight up for seven or eight sessions in a row, following a long run-up. Or one that rallies for eight out of 10 days.


•Largest weekly price spread. The difference between the week's high and low price is the biggest since the start of the move.


•Price pierces an upper channel line. A stock that breaks above its upper channel line after a run-up. The channel line should connect at least three highs over the past four or five months.


•Distance above 200-day moving average. The stock is extended when the price gets to be 70% to 100% or more stretched above its 200-day moving average. Few stocks can maintain that kind of momentum.


In the late 1990s **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) nearly quadrupled after coming out of a rare ascending base in October 1999. From Dec. 13 to Dec. 21, the stock rallied for seven straight sessions **(1)**. On Dec. 29, the stock had its biggest one-day point gain since its initial breakout back in January 1999 **(2)**. At the high of that day, the stock soared 251% above its 200-day moving average.


In the week ended Dec. 31, the stock had its largest weekly price spread (see weekly chart).


Qualcomm also suffered from excessive stock splits. The company had a 2-for-1 split in May of 1999 and then had a 4-for-1 split just over seven months later. The stock topped Jan. 3, 2000, and was nearly cut in half by Jan. 28 **(3)**.

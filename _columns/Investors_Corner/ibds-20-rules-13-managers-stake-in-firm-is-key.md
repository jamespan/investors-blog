*Thirteenth In A Series*

  

"Owner-operated" is always a good sign, whether stenciled on a big-rig truck or a leading stock.

  

In either case, it means those at the controls have a higher-than-usual interest in piloting the vehicle safely and profitably. In stocks, there are a number of ways to track down the percentage of outstanding shares owned by management.

  

The company descriptions in the Weekly IBD 50 lists include percentage of management ownership. In the most recent list, management of both **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Arcos Dorados** ([ARCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARCO)) owned more than 30% of shares outstanding. **IPG Photonics** ([IPGP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPGP)) took the prize, however, with 42% of shares owned by company executives.

  

The Big Cap 20 list also shows management ownership. By nature, big-cap stocks are generally older and have been public longer with much larger numbers of shares. Management naturally owns smaller portions. The biggest share of management ownership on the most recent Big Cap 20 list was **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), with a 20% share in management's keeping.

  

You can also find management ownership data using the E-Tables tool at investors.com. Just click on the "View Expanded Stock Data" function in the red band just below the Index tabs. This tool also allows you to sort by management ownership to quickly find stocks with strong management holdings.

  

Management held a 31% piece of stun gun maker **Taser** ([TASR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TASR)) when it started its epic run in April 2003. The stock ran up more than 4,000% in 12 months. By the peak, management ownership had dropped to 15%. The stock has never come close to that high again. Today, management holds 8% of the company's shares.

  

This is not to say that companies with lesser management ownership don't do well. Stocks often excel with minuscule management-share figures. And you would not want to use the percentage of management ownership as a sole or even a leading metric in choosing a stock. But it can act as a reinforcing piece of data.

  

So as you line up your pluses and minuses in fundamental research, don't ignore this factor, which suggests management is thoroughly vested in seeing that share prices do well.

  

Another good example is **Garmin Industries** ([GRMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRMN)). The innovative developer of global positioning equipment came public in December of 2000. When it cleared its initial base two years later, management owned 47% of the company's shares.

  

The stock climbed more than 900% over the next five years. When it peaked in October 2007, management still owned 47%. Today management's share is still healthy, but a much more modest 23%.

Nineteenth In A Series

  

Opportunity favors a certain balance of hardheadedness and adaptability: Hold tight to your basic principles, but keep a close eye out for shifting demands.

  

One subtle example: determining which types of stocks — small, mid or large caps — are in favor during any given uptrend.

  

Through the past decade, experience has taught that bull markets favor small-cap stocks. Small caps, or generally those stocks with market capitalizations of less than \$2 billion, are typically more volatile, more agile than their larger cohorts. Therefore, the thinking goes, they are faster to make gains on the way up, and quicker to surrender those gains once the bull turns tail, right?

  

Not always.

  

"From time to time, the market will shift its emphasis from small caps to large caps and vice versa," IBD Chairman and founder William O'Neil wrote in his book, "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

In the bull markets of the 21st century, small-cap and midcap stocks (\$2 billion to \$10 billion) have generally run a fairly tight race, but small-cap stocks have always come out on top. Both groups have vastly outpaced the S&P 500, which is made up of mainly large-cap stocks (above \$10 billion).

  

But in the six-year bull market from December 1995 to March 2000, the big-cap S&P 500 ran up 233%. The midcap S&P 400 gained 194% in the same period. The small caps in the S&P 600 climbed 133%.

  

O'Neil attributes this big-cap blitz to a rush by investors into mutual funds. Fund managers suddenly found themselves dealing with a surplus of cash, and channeled the money into big caps.

  

So, despite all the venture capital and dot-com start ups flooding the field, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) cornered the market-leading gains.

  

So how do you keep tabs on which segments are running strongest? The S&P 600 and the Russell 2000 are your best bets for tracking small caps. You can keep an eye on the charts of the Russell 2000 and midcap S&P 400 in IBD's B section.

  

Near the bottom of the How's The Market page you can also find the Market Indexes table. This lists one-day, as well as three- and six-month changes for the 400, 600 and the Russell 2000.

  

MarketSmith subscribers can view daily, weekly and monthly charts of S&P indexes through the website's Indices function.

  

Last but not least, scan the market caps of the IBD 50 stocks. About 40 stocks on the current list are midcaps and large-caps. This may simply be a sign that investors are focusing on the least volatile bets in a correcting market. But if the market kicks into an uptrend and that balance does not change, it may suggest the market may stick with the bigger stocks for a while.

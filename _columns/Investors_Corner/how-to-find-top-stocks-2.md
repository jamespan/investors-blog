Earnings are the most important factor in determining winning stocks. After all, earnings drive both the C ([current earnings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/)) and A ([annual earnings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/annual-earnings/)) factors in the [CAN SLIM seven-point investment model](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/). But IBD readers should also study three more numbers that are vitally important in how to find top stocks and companies with solid fundamentals.

Sales, profit margins and [return on equity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-growth-stocks-earnings-2019/) provide vital signs much like blood pressure, red blood cell count, and cholesterol measure a person's health.

These three financial elements not only offer significant insight into a company's fundamental strength. IBD research shows companies that excel in the stock market tend to have big numbers in those areas. With that knowledge in hand, IBD developed the Sales + Margins + Return on Equity Rating, or SMR for short.

Tapping IBD's vast stock database, the rating works by comparing sales growth over the past three quarters, pretax and after-tax profit margins and return on equity.

The SMR Rating features an A to E scale where A represents the top 20% of companies in terms of SMR scores.

## How To Find Top Stocks: Check Sales, Margins, Return On Equity

IBD computes sales growth and after-tax margins using quarterly figures. Return on equity and pretax margins come from the most recent annual figures. Also, the SMR rating gets a boost when IBD spots an acceleration in the rate of growth in any of those gauges.

Sales, of course, are just as closely watched as earnings when evaluating company performance. Pretax and after-tax margins show basically what's left after deducting operating costs. The larger the margin, the better a company's financial standing. [Return on equity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-growth-stocks-earnings-2019/) generally measures the profit from equity invested into a company and is a popular gauge of financial execution.

In some cases — such as companies that are unprofitable — Investor's Business Daily may not succeed in gathering sufficient data to calculate a full SMR Rating. Those will be listed as "N/A" in IBD's research tools. For instance, you cannot compute an ROE when a company has negative shareholders' equity.

Keep in mind that a turnaround company will score poorly in its SMR Rating. But some can still go on to become successful stocks, so allow for deficiencies in those cases.

When you research stocks, an A or B SMR Rating is best. A C rating is neutral and can be acceptable if other fundamentals are strong.

You can use the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-splunk-inc-splk.aspx) at Investors.com to compare a company's rating to its peers. If a stock doesn't pass the grade, Stock Checkup could clue you to other, better-graded companies. Why do this? A true market winner tends to show the best profit margins within the industry.

Back in July of 2018, **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) was rising from a pullback to the 10-week moving average. **Ollie's Bargain Outlet** ([OLLI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLLI)) and **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) were [forming bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) that would soon result in productive breakouts.

All three showed an SMR Rating of A at the time.

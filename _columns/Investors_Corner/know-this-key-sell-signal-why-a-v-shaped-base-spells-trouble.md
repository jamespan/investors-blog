Your mom might have told you to never judge people by their looks. But it's OK to do that when it's time to decide [when to sell top stocks](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/).




Do you want to improve your chart-reading skills? If you do, you'll be able to improve your returns in the stock market by avoiding stocks that form the V-shaped base. And if you harbor a big gain in a stock that carves out this faulty pattern, then you know the market has presented you the gift of insight from IBD's research that the stock is very close to peaking, and thus must be sold.


Investors should be discriminating against bases that are V-shaped. Not only does a V-shaped cup pattern differ greatly from winning cup bases, but it also may bring about other sell signals.


Just because a stock with strong fundamentals shapes [a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) doesn't mean that it's an automatic buy.

When To Sell Top Stocks: A V-Shaped Base Does Not Spell 'Victory'
-----------------------------------------------------------------


A V-shaped base may initially look good; the stock stages a fast recovery after selling off. But sometimes this type of action is akin to being too fast, too furious. Not healthy.


V-shaped bases don't allow a stock to go through a [more natural price correction](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). After a sharp pullback, it's good to see a stock consolidate for two or three weeks to wear out the remaining weak holders. This creates [a better foundation and results in a U-shaped pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/).



While a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) or [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) can be as short as six or seven weeks, respectively, the bases of some of the biggest stock market winners have taken months or more to form. **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) cleared a five-month cup with handle in January 1999 and staged an astronomical run.


**SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) blasted out of a 10-month cup-with-handle pattern in 2006 and more than quadrupled before topping.


Sometimes in a V-shaped base, a stock will fall hard for a couple of weeks and then rally for a couple of weeks of gains into new-high ground. This fast recovery into new highs is a sell signal and means that a stock could be topping.


At times, the pullback will send the stock to its 10-week moving average, typically in heavy volume. This two weeks down and two weeks up sell signal generally occurs after a long uptrend. Keep watch for variations of this sell signal. Sometimes it can be one week down, followed by two or three weeks up to a new high.


The V Base In Intuitive Surgical
--------------------------------


In late October 2007, **Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) fell for three straight weeks **(1)**, but found support at its 10-week moving average.


![IC_isrg_100316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IC_isrg_100316.jpg)


At this point, the decline looked normal; it was a fine start to a potential new base. Volume during the latter two weeks cooled down, another good sign.


The leading maker of robotic surgical systems then rose for three weeks in a row. The result: a faulty V-shaped base that was five weeks long — one week short of the six-week minimum length for a [cup with no handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-202-why-some-great-cup-bases-dont-form-a-handle/).


The good times didn't last. Intuitive Surgical reversed lower after clearing the 359.69 [proper entry](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Shares slumped 37% over the next few weeks before getting support at its 40-week line **(2)**. What if you had bought the stock as it cleared the V-shaped cup?


By keeping losses small, you would have avoided serious pain in your portfolio.


By late November 2008, amid a crushing bear market, Intuitive plunged to 110.35, down 69% from its 52-week peak of 357.98.


So [always cut your losses at no more than 7% to 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/). If the stock action doesn't look right, by all means sell more quickly.

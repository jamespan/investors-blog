Becoming an excellent investor isn't so much about what you know as what you know to ask.


Savvy investors differ from amateurs on that score. The savvy investor knows what to ask, and knows the most important question takes just three words: Is it working?


Everything the savvy investor does proceeds from the answer to that question.


Questions from amateurs are far different. The questions often revolve around a bargain mentality: Is it cheap? Is it getting cheaper? Should I buy more now that the stock has dived?


Sometimes the questions reveal a disposition to argue with the market: Why is my stock going down? Why doesn't the Fed do something? Why don't they fire the CEO? Why doesn't the SEC investigate these crooks? What's that guy who works at the company and often posts on the stock message board think?


Online forums are filled with these kinds of desperate and inane questions from shareholders. It's as if there were a federal law that prevented anxiety-filled shareholders from selling a stock.


Now consider the beauty of the right question.


Is it working?


Those three unemotional words sweep aside all the noise. It doesn't matter if the stock is **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) or a recent new IPO like **Zulily** ([ZU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZU)).


Is it working?


If you want to put a sticker on your computer to remind yourself what investing is mostly about, those three words might be it. The answer to that question will guide the experienced investor to the right action. Either the stock is working or it is not.


If the stock isn't working, the choices are simple. If the movement is sideways, you might give it more time. If the movement is down, you might sell all or part of the investment.


An investor needn't wait for the stock to trigger the 8% sell rule. William J. O'Neil's "How to Make Money in Stocks" mentions one money manager who favors selling half of a position when the stock is down 5% from the buy point and the other half position if it falls 10%. This is a useful approach, especially for people who find it hard to take a loss in one gulp.


What if the stock is working?


Savvy investors and amateurs differ on this, too.


When a stock is working, the savvy investor will force-feed the stock, adding more shares to his or her position at appropriate junctures. Those junctures might include a three-weeks-tight pattern, a first or second trip and bounce off the 50-day moving average and a new early stage base.


Granted, the add-on buys are small compared to the original stake (the exception: a breakout from another early stage base ). However, if the investor is riding a monster stock, the additions on the way up can add significantly to the dollar gains, even as they trim the percentage gain.


Amateur emotions come into play on force-feeding, too.


The amateur doesn't like adding shares to a position that's working for two reasons.


First, he or she is convinced that it's dangerous to buy a rising stock. Second, the amateur likes to brag about how much he or she is up. While add-on buys might add profits, the percentage gain will be smaller.


And that's yet another difference. For wise investors, stocks are about making money. For amateurs, it's all about their ego.

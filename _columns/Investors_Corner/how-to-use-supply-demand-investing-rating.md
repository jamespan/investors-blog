  Supply/Demand Rating Can Be Useful In Right Situation

IBD's investing dashboard has many gauges, the most important being the price and volume charts of the major indexes.


Some gauges in this newspaper have more limited uses, or their usefulness emerges only at certain junctures.


An IBD screen that highlights stocks with high Supply/Demand Ratings, usually published under the B section's New High column, fits the limited-use category.


The Supply/Demand rating — included in the mini charts of the Sector Leaders, IBD 50, Your Weekly Review and Big Cap 20 features — measures trading relative to a stock's float.


The trading can reflect selling or buying, so a high rating isn't necessarily bullish.


The float is how many shares are available to trade in the open market.


An investor might regard the Supply/Demand Rating as an intensity gauge. If a stock with a high Supply/Demand Rating is rising, then it suggests that bulls are grabbing shares briskly.


If a stock with a high Supply/Demand Rating is falling, then investors are selling at every opportunity.


Naturally, the individual investor wants to be on the right side of the action.


Research from a March 27, 2008, Investor's Corner column found some evidence that the Supply/Demand Rating is tied to how smoothly a stock rises.


For example, a look at 26 top-rated stocks that broke out during [the August-to-October 2007 rally](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/444465-investors-corner-supplydemand-rating-gauges-trading.htm) shows that stocks with an exceptionally high Supply/Demand Rating were the stocks that rode — from buy point to peak — an invisible cushion above the 50-day line. However, the August-October run was a very strong uptrend.


How does the gauge fare in a more pedestrian uptrend? The short answer: a lukewarm uptrend can barely budge the gauge's needle.


Generally, it takes a Supply/Demand Rating of 94 to make the list. This year, only six stocks made the Supply/Demand screen at any point in the past eight months. Many appeared for only a single day. And for all but 11 days this year, no stock made the list.


This isn't too surprising, given that the move to new highs in the indexes this year has been more a casual stroll than a frantic run.


Sometimes a gauge says more about the market than it says about individual stocks. Silence from the Supply/Demand screen suggests that intensity is missing among both bulls and bears.


The run-up in 2007 featured many stocks with high Supply/Demand Ratings (see the chart of **Synaptics** ([SYNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SYNA)) above), but the run-up was a late-cycle move.


What about the early-cycle move in 2009?


In the days after the March 12, 2009, follow-through day, numerous stocks had ratings at 94 or higher, including **NetLogic Microsystems** ([NETL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NETL)) and **Aeropostale** ([ARO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARO)). Others, such as **Panera Bread** ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), were at 92 or 93.


Batch tests of three markets probably aren't enough to draw a set-in-stone conclusion. Yet it's reasonable to become suspicious when few stocks carry high Supply/Demand Ratings.


The scarcity of high Supply/Demand stocks could point to a market that lacks intense conviction. That's reason enough to check this gauge on a regular basis.

Research shows that earnings are a key driver in a stock's performance. Consider this finding in "How to Make Money in Stocks" by IBD founder William J. O'Neil:

  

"In our models of the 600 best-performing stocks from 1952 to 2001, three out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the latest publicly reported quarter before they began their major advances. Those that did not show solid current quarterly earnings increases did so in the very next quarter, with an average earnings increase of 90%."

  

Here are six things to keep in mind about earnings:

  

• **Don't invest in promises** : Sometimes a company will have lackluster earnings, but either management or stock analysts or both will talk about big gains that aren't far away. You might be tempted to get in early, but that's a mistake. Wait until the company delivers results.

  

• **Use the apt comparison**: Look at quarterly changes in earnings per share vs. the year-ago period. If an investor compares EPS to the previous quarter, seasonality can distort results.

  

• **Know what to ignore**: If a quarter involves a one-time gain from the sale of a building, for example, make sure that factor is not included in the results being studied. You want to consider the company's ongoing profitability.

  

• **Be aware of costs excluded**: Some companies don't count stock-based compensation as an expense. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), stock-based compensation is an expense. But CFOs like to point to non-GAAP figures that strip out stock-based compensation.

  

In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ruled that companies had to expense stock-based compensation.

  

Companies can meet this requirement by reporting GAAP and non-GAAP results.

  

• **Don't be misled**: Some investors will continue to hold a late-stage stock because the earnings still look good. But the earnings growth that helped identify a winner on the buy side are of little use on the sell side. A decision to sell should be based on the chart action. In most cases, the chart will signal "sell" before EPS will.

  

• **Be aware of buybacks**: The key expression is earnings per share. When a company buys back shares, the number of shares outstanding decreases. This can increase EPS. Also, if demand for the stock increases and there are fewer shares outstanding, this can increase a stock's price.

  

Earnings data can be found on Investors.com and in IBD (see B4 in Monday's paper). The weekly earnings calendar, which appears in Monday's IBD on B2, lists notable companies set to announce quarterly earnings results.

  

IBD's [EPS Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) measures EPS over the past three to five years and the stability of that growth. Four factors go into the calculation: EPS vs. the year-ago quarter; the prior quarter vs. the same quarter a year ago; the five-year earnings growth rate; and the earnings stability factor. The weighting is proprietary. Results are ranked on a 1-to-99 scale with 99 meaning the stock is in the top 1 percentile.

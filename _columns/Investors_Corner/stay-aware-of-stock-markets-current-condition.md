**How To Profit From MAKING MONEY:** [Sixth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/603354/201203061545/how-to-profit-from-ibds-making-money-.aspx)

Casual talk about the stock market along with 40 cents might get you a cup of mediocre coffee out of a vending machine.

It won't get you much more.

If you listen to such speculation, it usually revolves around one question. "Where do you think the market's going?"

Fortunetelling, however, is a loser's game.

Even reading too much about economic or political conditions can lead the investor astray. Is Greece headed for a contagious disaster? Is the U.S. about to run off a fiscal cliff? Will a war in Iran create oil-price chaos? Can the U.S. economy get out of first gear? Will the November election make things tougher or easier for traders?

If you thought too much about those concerns, you wouldn't have bought a single stock in the vigorous uptrend that was confirmed Dec. 20.

Fortunately, there is a way to invest without hyperventilating about the future.

The approach is best reflected by the name of the page on B6 in Monday's paper and B2 the rest of the week. The name of the page is "How's The Market?" — not "Where's The Market Going?"

The disciplined investor focuses on present conditions, not what might happen.

Point this out to amateur investors and they will say something like this: "Fool, I already know present conditions. My stocks went up today. Don't waste my time on the obvious. I want to know what the market's going to do tomorrow!"

Decency prevents a frank reply to those kinds of remarks in most social situations. But what if you could give such investors a 12-question pop quiz on the "present conditions" that they "already know"?

Here's the quiz:

**1.** What has the price and volume action been like on the major indexes in recent weeks?

**2.** What have the closes been like?

**3.** Are there any positive or negative reversals?

**4.** Are there any divergences between the indexes?

**5.** Are the indexes showing accumulation or distribution? How much?

**6.** What's the NYSE advance-decline line doing?

**7.** How is the IBD Mutual Fund Index performing?

**8.** What industry groups are performing best and which are underperforming?

**9.** Which groups have the highest percentage of stocks at new highs?

**10.** Which Fidelity industry funds are doing best year to date?

**11.** Which market indexes are doing best?

**12.** Where is the bulls vs. bears gauge at? What has been the trend?

Those 12 questions and more are answered every day on the How's The Market page (today on B2).

If you want to know present conditions, take a red pen and a green pen and mark up the page every day .

The effort will give you a better idea of market conditions than knowledge of what your stocks did yesterday will.

If you stay on top of the market's current conditions, you will make better decisions than the clowns who only know "what my stocks did yesterday" and who resist learning anything else.

Investing, like anything that is done well, requires awareness of what's going on around you — now.

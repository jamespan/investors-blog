The second quarter of [earnings season](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) in 2019 is still going strong. The time when the cream of growth stocks within the stock market crop rises to the top.




A strong earnings release can propel top stocks to previously unforeseen levels, while a disappointing announcement can send shares tumbling. Being able to buy a stock when it is strong and advancing is a key principle of [how to invest](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/) in top growth stocks.


Companies disclose their earnings reports four times a year. The quarterly results offer investors an opportunity to examine how the company is performing at a detailed level. From there, analysts and professional fund managers use that information to project the company's future earnings and sales growth and create price targets for the company's stock price.


The stock market's reaction to an earnings release can often tell you more than the earnings themselves. If the results seem strong, but the stock is selling off after hours, then investors may be concerned about the sustainability of growth, rising costs or myriad other potential fundamental negatives.

Breakaway Gaps Can Lead To Big Gains
------------------------------------



With the stock market back in a [confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), as a result of last Friday's Day 7 [follow-through day](http://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/), investors should now be honing their watch list of potential stock ideas.


Investors should be closely watching top stocks over the coming weeks as they report quarterly results. A positive result could trigger a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/). It occurs when buying demand heavily outstrips supply at current levels, sparking a big rise in share price.


The [MarketSmith Breakaway Gap report](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), a premium feature, highlights stocks surging above [potential buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/), using MarketSmith's Pattern Recognition feature.


When a stock gaps above a [potential buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), an alert will appear on the chart to notify you of the stock's bullish action. [MarketSmith daily and weekly charts](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) boast premarket and after-hours trading on the Nasdaq exchange.


After a company reports earnings (good or bad), the chart will update price changes in extended-hours trade.

Many people want to explore their roots, and the Web can make it easier to access birth, marriage and death records.

  

Put those two facts together, and you've got at least a partial explanation for **Ancestry.com**'s ([ACOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACOM)) strong growth — as well as its impressive performance in the stock market.

  

The family history website has been one of the market's big winners in the past year and a half.

  

By late April of this year, it had more than tripled from its price levels in November 2009, the month of its debut.

  

So how might you have spotted a buy opportunity? Well, Ancestry offered several entry points.

  

The stock cleared its first base in fast trade in early March 2010 **1**. The breakout came amid the Nasdaq's follow-through day on March 1, 2010, that signaled a new market rally.

  

The stock broke out of its second base in late September **2** , topping a 21.45 high handle buy point after the follow-through day on Sept. 1.

  

Still, even if you missed these breakouts from bases, Ancestry presented a couple of secondary buying opportunities.

  

The stock pulled back to support just above its 10-week moving average in mid-November. It didn't quite touch its 10-week line, but the move was close enough to qualify as a pullback. It then lifted off that area of support, providing a chance to buy **3**. Volume was strong, as you'd prefer to see **4**.

  

Before that pullback, Ancestry also formed a three-weeks-tight structure, a bullish follow-on pattern **5**. But it bided its time before clearing that pattern's buy point at 28.46. So it's probably best to view its action as a 10-week pullback.

  

Ancestry staged another rebound off its 10-week line in January of this year **6**, when the market was in a confirmed uptrend. The move also could have been interpreted as a breakout beyond a base with resistance around 30.

  

So when might you have sold this genealogy play? If you had bought off the January rebound, you might have sold sometime in February after scoring a 20% to 25% gain. Patient investors might have been able to hold through declines in March and April, perhaps noting that the stock found support at the prior area of resistance around 30 — an encouraging sign.

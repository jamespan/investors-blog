In your search for winning stocks, one of the first things you should look at is a company's current quarterly earnings growth.

This is the 'C' in IBD's CAN SLIM investment [methodology](http://education.investors.com/) .

Top-notch profit growth is one of the most important traits in stock market winners. As noted in "How To Make Money In Stocks" by William O'Neil, IBD chairman and founder, **Dell's** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) earnings jumped 74% and 108% in the two quarters before its run-up from November 1996. **America Online** ([AOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AOL)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) each put up triple-digit gains in their quarterly profits before starting their major moves.

More recently, **BitAuto** ([BITA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BITA)), a Chinese provider of automobile information, grew quarterly earnings 29% to 109% in the two quarters before it shot out of a seven-week consolidation in the week ended Oct. 4, 2013. And high-end furnishings retailer **Restoration Hardware's** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH))EPS climbed 30% to 357% in fiscal Q2 through fiscal Q4 of 2013. Restoration blasted out of a cup base in June in reaction to another solid earnings report.

Theoretically, robust profit growth is a key fundamental driver of a company's stock price. The stock of a company that is performing better in its operations should command a higher price. Over the long term, there's no reason for the stock to move up if the company is not delivering higher or strong earnings per share for its shareholders.

When looking at earnings of top companies, it's not the absolute figure that is important. So don't pass up Company ABC if its latest quarterly earnings was 50 cents a share vs. \$1 a share for Company XYZ. It's the percentage increase from the same period a year ago that's key.

While any increase is a good thing, insist on seeing bottom-line growth of at least 25%. The higher the increase, the better. Growth at some top companies will be in the triple digits, telling you that business is really booming.

Recent new issue **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) has delivered triple-digit profit growth in its latest two quarters. But one quarter benefited from an easy comparison of a penny a share from the year before.

The earnings figures that companies report should be from their core operations. The numbers shouldn't include the sale of assets or other extraordinary gains. If a software company sells a piece of land, that gain should not be included in its operating earnings.

Investors can find stocks with fast quarterly earnings growth in the IBD 50, Friday's Your Weekly Review, Sector Leaders and IBD Big Cap 20. You can also find screens for firms with strong growth in [Screen Center](http://research.investors.com/screen-center/?nav=ResearchSC) on Investors.com.

In Dec. 29's IBD 50 list, **Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), an **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) supplier, grew earnings 124% in the latest reported quarter. **AmTrust Financial Services'** ([AFSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AFSI)) latest quarterly profit jumped 105%. The stock recently hit the 20%-to-25% profit target from a 46.12 buy point in a double-bottom base.

While not quite in the triple digits, **Ambarella's** ([AMBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMBA)) earnings jumped 84% in its latest quarter. The chip designer is benefiting from strong demand for **GoPro** ([GPRO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GPRO)) camera, as well as video equipment used for security and surveillance purposes.

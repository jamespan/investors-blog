The stock market has been volatile this year, due to a healthy dose of China trade headlines and fears of a recession. But recession fears have moved to the back burner amid a big surge in the 10-year Treasury bond yield since early September.

As a result, institutional selling in the major stock indexes has been contained after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 [confirmed a new uptrend on Aug. 13](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bulls-get-third-major-buy-signal-this-year-why/). The next day, a big sell-off across the market resulted in a downgrade in the current outlook to "Uptrend under pressure." But positive market action returned. [The Sept. 5 Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/trade-war-news-lifts-stock-market/) delivered an improved outlook back to "Uptrend resumes."

In a nascent uptrend, monitoring signs of [institutional selling](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) in the indexes is a critical skill to learn for growth investors. Some say it's impossible to time the stock market. But IBD readers can in fact recognize when mutual funds and other big investors start selling stock en masse. This causes downward pressure in the stock indexes. It can be a precursor to more market downside.

A [distribution day count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) can be found in the Market Pulse graphic in each day's [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) column. Distribution days do not get counted when the stock market is in correction mode.

## Stock Market Health: Distribution Days

Simply put, a distribution day for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite is a significant decline in higher volume on the corresponding stock exchange. (For the S&P 500, IBD uses NYSE composite turnover.) Distribution days can be mild when an index falls, say, 0.2% or 0.3% in higher volume. Or they can be significant when an index slumps 2% or 3% in higher volume.

When an index shows [stalling action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/), you can count it as distribution. Stalling occurs when an index rises early, then fades and closes in the bottom half of its intraday range in higher volume. Wall Street is signaling waning buying demand.

When a distribution day is added to the count, it doesn't stay there forever. Higher-volume declines, or stalling sessions, are removed due to time (25 trading sessions) or if an index rallies 5% from the distribution day.

When distribution days start to cluster over a short period time, be on guard for a market pullback — especially if leading stocks are starting to show [sell signals](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/).

## The Key Stock Market Uptrend Signal In January

The S&P 500 kicked off 2019 with a [Day 7 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on Jan. 4. The large-cap index rallied more than 14% before five distribution days entered the fray between April 16 and May 9.

That was around the time savvy growth investors started to think about [locking in solid short-term gains](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) in some winners spawned by the [Jan. 4 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/).

Starting on April 16, the index flashed four higher-volume declines and a stalling session before pulling back another 4.9% to a low of 2728.81 in early June.

If you've read Investor's Corner for the past eight or nine days, you've placed into your hands a real map to find stock-market treasure.


That's because you are now acquainted with seven major base patterns that great stocks form before taking off.


Use today's column as a reference guide to these important patterns, which appear time over time in bull markets going back to 1900. History indeed repeats itself.


**The Cup With Handle**


Make sure this common winning pattern meets the following criteria.


1. Does the base last from seven weeks to 65 weeks?


2. Is the bottom of the cup no more than 12% to 33% below the cup's high point?


3. Does the handle begin in the upper half of the base and form in below-average volume? Does the handle correct less than 12%?


4. Does the stock hit the buy point — 10 cents above the handle's high — in 40% above-normal volume?


**The Double Bottom**


The basics: It looks like the letter W and has a depth and length similar to that of the cup-with-handle base. Also confirm:


1. Does the second bottom undercut or at least match the first bottom?


2. Is the middle peak in the upper half of the base? The buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak.


**The Flat Base**


It has a rectangular shape and the buy point is typically 10 cents above the base's high. It often forms after a cup or double bottom.


1. Is the base at least five weeks long?


2. Does it correct less than 15%?


**High, Tight Flag**


One of the rarest bases, so the rules below should be followed carefully.


1. Does the base start with a near-vertical ascent of at least 100% in four to eight weeks?


2. Does the base form a flag, or a low-volume pullback of 10% to around 25%, in three to five weeks?


3. The buy point is 10 cents above the highest point in the flag.


**Saucer Base**


This pattern, like cup-type bases, must stretch for seven weeks or more. But the shape is a distinguishing factor.


1. Does the pattern appear shallower than a cup with handle?


2. Does the correction in the base range from 12% to 20% in a market uptrend? In a correction, the decline can sometimes exceed 30%.


3. The buy point is 10 cents above the base's high.


**Square Box**


This pattern forms quickly and can sometimes be seen as a flat base. But it's different.


1. Does it range in length from at least four weeks to at most seven weeks? Does it also have a square-like, boxy look?


2. Is the decline no more than 15% from top to bottom?


3. The buy point is a dime above the top of the box.


**Ascending Base**


This one is easy to miss because it's usually characterized by three pullbacks and three advances, each making a higher high and a higher low. They typically form in a volatile market. Here's what to look for:


1. Do the three pullbacks range from 10% to 20% and does the entire pattern take nine to 16 weeks to develop?


2. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the third wave.

Few glasses will be raised New Year's Eve toasting 2014 as a great year for stock investing.

  

It was choppy and yielded only small gains. Many promising trades ended in profitless round trips. But investors could have made a bundle in **Skyworks Solutions** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)). Its breakout and advance were classic as it rose 161% from a January breakout.

  

It took more than a year for the base to develop. Then Skyworks broke out Jan. 13 with volume 95% above average. The stock gapped up as it moved past a buy point near 28.66, but finished in the lower half of its daily range and below the buy point.

  

That's discouraging, but it didn't trigger any sell rules. So the lesson is, don't give up on it just because the breakout wasn't everything you hoped for. A few days later, it leaped nearly 7% on volume 397% above average.

  

At the time, the Composite Rating was 95, the EPS Rating was 94, the Relative Price Strength Rating was 88, the SMR Rating was A and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating was B+. Earnings the past five quarters rose 8% 14%, 20%, 21% and 22%. Earnings growth acceleration is a plus.

  

The company makes chips used in a variety of industries, but its growth engines are chips that enable connectivity in smartphones made by Apple and Samsung.

  

By April, the stock was having its first correction of note. It pulled back almost exactly to its 10-week moving average, then exploded off of it in the week ending April 25 **(1)**.

  

Skyworks did not advance 20% from the proper buy point in three weeks or less, so an investor could be forgiven if it was sold on the way up for a 20% or 25% gain. But the investor with renewed conviction in the company could have bought back shares as it moved off the line.

  

The critical day was April 23, right after it had posted earnings 29% greater than the year before. The earnings acceleration continued, and the stock gapped higher.

  

From there, it made a three-weeks-tight pattern **(2)**. After noodling around just below a 44.27 buy point from the top of the pattern, it finally broke above it.

  

In mid-July, the stock bounced off its 10-week line for a second time **(3)**; volume soared. The catalyst: another earnings report showing a 54% rise vs. the prior year. Acceleration continued. An investor can add to an already successful position on the first two pullbacks to the 10-week line. But a third or fourth pullback poses more danger.

  Rare Stock Chart Characteristic Looks Bullish, But Is Actually A Red Flag

Some stock chart formations are so rare, when they happen it's something investors cannot ignore. One such case is when a stock soars to new highs straight from the lows of its base.


In most [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/best-stocks-to-buy-form-bullish-bases-before-big-price-gains/), the stock price makes a gradual recovery to new highs. Usually, it takes several weeks or more for the stock to go from its lows to new highs.


A stock that goes from the base's lows to new highs may look bullish. But this type of ultrarapid recovery — in one or two weeks — is a bad sign.




[IBD founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/william-oneil-legendary-investor-ibd-founder-canslim-creator/) called this rare move "straight up from the bottom." He considered it risky because the stock has had no late pullback, such as what you might see in the [handle of a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/). Instead of investors making steady share purchases or having a final shakeout, the buying happens in a flurry.


Once that occurs, you have to wonder how many more buyers are left to keep the stock climbing. And a sudden burst can tempt some investors to take profits.


A key point: If the surge from the lows falls short of new highs, that's not necessarily bad. Only when the stock hits new highs past a buy point, you have to question the breakout.


MSCI Stock Chart And Its Too-Fast Breakout
------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IC2c040422-300x161.jpg)You can spot this flaw using weekly charts at Investors.com.


In one of the rare cases, a powerful-looking breakout for **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) occurred the first week of November 2020. The financial data and index manager had formed a 14-week base **(1)**.


MSCI shares rallied more than 20% as they topped the 398.49 buy point in heavy volume **(2)**. In just five days the stock jumped more than 18%. Volume was heavy, too.


But the very next week, MSCI stock gave back about half the gain and was back below the buy point **(3)**. While there was no sell signal (the drop from the entry was [less than 7% or 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/)), the stock needed more time. The move straight up from the bottom was the key to reading this breakout.


It formed a lopsided [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-101-in-a-flat-base-dull-trade-can-be-positive-action/) for five weeks **(4)**. That breakout also flopped. MSCI finally got it right with its next base. A 12-week [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) saw tight trading in the handle area and a solid breakout in June **(5)**.

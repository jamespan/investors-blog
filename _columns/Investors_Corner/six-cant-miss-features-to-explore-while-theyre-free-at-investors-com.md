For one more week through Oct. 8, all of the IBD features that normally require a subscription are open for everyone to use. Our stock screens, expert analysis and other content are freely available, thanks to this hall pass.


If this is your first unrestricted browse through Investors.com, here's how to use these tools.


**The Big Picture:** This daily market analysis separates itself from the rest of the financial press because it applies the objective investment principles IBD has developed over decades of market research. Based on a careful and historically proven analysis of the day-to-day price and volume action of the Nasdaq and S&P 500, as well as leading stocks and other key market indicators, the [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) column unpacks each day's action and puts investors on the road map to truly understanding what the market is doing right now.


No one can foretell the future, especially on Wall Street. The current action is the starting point for serious growth investors; let the market direction guide all stock decisions, then shift your plan when the market does so.


This is the M in the [CAN SLIM seven-letter investment system](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) created by IBD founder William O'Neil. The market's current outlook is updated each day in The Big Picture's Market Pulse table. If the outlook is a confirmed uptrend, conditions are best for buying and holding stocks. A market under pressure requires you to cut exposure and be picky about buying.


A market in correction means it's time to sell shares and avoid buying altogether.


Also read The Big Picture for clues on leading stocks, sector rotation and other signals that guide portfolio management.


**Stock Lists:** If the market is in a confirmed uptrend, actively look for stock ideas. IBD produces nearly a dozen lists, but the most useful are [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Stock Spotlight](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/), [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/), [IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) and [New Highs](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/). Find all of them under "[Stock Lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/)" at Investors.com.


Computer screens generate each list, but senior IBD writers pick the stocks discussed in these columns and focus on those near buy points. What computers cannot spot, IBD's writers and editors can. Key fundamental or technical weaknesses in a stock, or the rise of an industry trend that impacts a company, spark a thoughtful perspective and an action plan that only human stock analysis can provide.


In [IBD Weekly](http://epaper.investors.com/Olive/ODN/IBD/Default.aspx), the once-a-week print newspaper, features include one-year weekly mini charts. At the bottom of each chart see a brief analysis that helps you determine the correct buy point, decide when to hold shares, and determine the right time to sell.


**IBD Stock Checkup:** This is number-crunching at its finest. Using IBD's stock database, [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) measures a stock by its financials, price-volume action and other factors. Tables on fundamentals and technicals display the key numbers.


But where Stock Checkup really shines is the way it weighs each stock against others and how it uses a Checklist that assigns a green-yellow-red color code, depending on good, mediocre or bad grades. Instantly, you see how a stock compares against its peers in terms of IBD Ratings and how it fares on the most important factors that historically separate the winners.


Use the Stock Checkup to select stocks for a watchlist and filter out the ones that are lacking in multiple areas. Use IBD Stock Lists to save your watchlist.


**Stocks On The Move:** Once you have a watchlist and the buy points picked out, the wait begins. Buy stocks only when they climb above buy points in heavy volume.


A great tool to spot those moves is [Stocks On The Move](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx). It finds those that are moving in the highest trading compared to normal patterns. Sudden burst of volume tell you that institutional investors are piling into a stock â€” or out of one, on the decliners list.


If you see a stock of interest on the list of stocks rising, this could be your chance to buy. Make sure shares are above the buy point (and no higher than 5% from the entry) and volume is at least 40% above average.


**Top-Rated Stocks Under \$10:** Historically, winning stocks are priced well above \$10 a share. But from time to time, investors can find success with lower-priced stocks. The [Top-Rated Stocks Under \$10](http://research.investors.com/topratedunder10/?nav=ResearchUnder10) tool lists and ranks the small fry by IBD Ratings, accelerating sales growth and other marks of emerging leadership.


**IBD eTables:** What if IBD's stock tables were in an electronic format and you could sort them by two dozen different factors? That's the beauty of [eTables](http://research.investors.com/etables/?nav=ResearcheTables). Want a specific list such as the IBD 50 or your own IBD Stock Lists? ETables has that too, with charts and Stock Checkups to boot.


Unfettered access to Investors.com ends Oct. 8. It does not include [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx), [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) or [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012GE5).

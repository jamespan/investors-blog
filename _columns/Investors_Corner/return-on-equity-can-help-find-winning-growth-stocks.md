Return on equity is one of the most important criteria for finding growth stocks with superior fundamentals. And top-notch fundamentals are one of the key components within the [Investor's Business Daily investing system.](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/getting-started/)




Luckily, investors can use [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith) to seek out stocks that excel in this fundamental measure of profitability.


Return On Equity: A Key Criteria For Top Growth Stocks
------------------------------------------------------


What makes return on equity, or ROE, so important is that it serves as a unique measure of profitability. Essentially, return on equity is a reflection of how well a company's management is handling the business. Think of return on equity as a measure of the dollars in profit vs. equity invested into a company. It is a useful measure to gauge financial execution and select the stocks with a higher potential of long-term success.


To calculate ROE, it's simply a company's annual net income divided by shareholders' equity. Multiply the ratio by 100 to arrive at a percentage figure.


IBD's method of investing advocates focusing on growth stocks with an ROE of at least 17% or higher. Additionally, IBD uses average shareholder equity over the past two years, not just the most recent year.


You could sift through a company's earnings to discover its ROE. Or you can use IBD's proprietary [SMR Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-stock-market-rally-use-smr-rating-growth-stocks/), found in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). SMR stands for sales, margins and return on equity.


In a single letter grade, the rating immediately tells investors how a given growth stock stacks up in those important factors. Investors want to ideally focus on those with an SMR grade of A or B.


Using MarketSmith To Find Stocks With High ROE
----------------------------------------------


Other than earnings and sales, ROE is among the most important criteria for investors to look at before investing in growth stocks. MarketSmith chart analysis is a useful tool for identifying stocks with strong ROE.


Upon screening for stocks with an ROE of 17% or higher in the most recent fiscal year, a stock price of 25 or higher, a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 85 or higher and average daily volume of 500,000 shares or more, [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) returns quite a large list of stocks.


Boosting ROE to 30% or higher shrinks the results and narrows the list down to stocks with stronger [EPS Ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investors-corner-eps-rating/).


Investors using the screen must also go beyond simply seeking out stocks with a high ROE number. Be sure to pay attention to the other fundamental aspects including pretax margin, real sales and strong sales growth, as well as a [product or service that leads the marketplace.](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/new-product/)

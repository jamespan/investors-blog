The [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-etf-etn-hiding-places-going-on/) gave way to a potent market uptrend that still generates winning stocks. Many stocks surged in just a few weeks, and a select few used those fast rallies to form an unusual but powerful chart pattern.


The 2020 stock market was one of the best ever for the Nasdaq composite. Some growth stocks doubled in a matter of weeks. A pause after those strong gains resulted in new buy points, albeit in only a few cases.


Breakout Stocks: The Power Of A High Tight Flag Base
----------------------------------------------------


When looking for quality setups, a great place to start is with the charts. A chart pattern recognition tool like [MarketSmith chart analysis](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) can help investors spot key patterns conducive to successful breakout stocks. These ideal trading patterns are commonly known as [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/).


[A base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) is like a launchpad. It offers the stock a strong level of support as it's breaking out from a given price area. Additionally, bases give the investor objective points of reference in the form of [buy zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/), [profit-taking zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) and [loss zones](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) so you're well prepared ahead of the breakout.


Among IBD's [eight very important chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), the high, tight flag might be the rarest and most powerful. The base's most striking characteristic is the way it begins with a price run of 100% to 120% in a four to eight week time frame.


After such a move, most investors would walk away thinking they missed the breakout. But in the case of the high, tight flag, such an intense price run is just the beginning.


Following its initial price run, the stock then typically corrects 10% to 25% over the next three to five weeks. Should the sell-off occur in light volume, the stock will likely attempt to break out again above the base's most recent high.


Light volume during the correction means the sell-off has no real momentum. It simply served as a shakeout of weaker investors. After the shakeout, the uptrend momentum will resume again.


In 2020, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) and **Zoom Video** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) formed high, tight flags.


The high, tight flag is perhaps the strongest of all the chart patterns. But it's also the hardest to interpret correctly.


Let's take a look at an example of one such base in Tesla, one found well before 2020.


Tesla Stock: Example Of A High Tight Flag Winner
------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ICtesla041320-182x300.jpg)Tesla stock formed a high, tight flag after its initial breakout from a first-stage base in April 2013. To begin the base, Tesla stock notched gains of nearly 150% over an eight-week period. Shares then peaked at 114.90 during the week ended May 31. Adding 10 cents to the peak gives you the base's [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 115.


Next, Tesla stock had a four-week shakeout, falling 23% from its high as it formed the flag portion of the base. Volume lightened up amid the relatively mild correction. Tesla took out the base's high during the week ended July 5 with a 12% gain.


Also impressive? Trading volume increased vs. the prior week, even in spite of the fact that Independence Day made it a four-day trading week.


After a multi-month price run to as high as 194.50, Tesla stock finally cooled off with a close below its 10-week line during the week ended Oct. 25. The stock ended around 169.66 — 47% above the original 115 buy point.


Tesla entered [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) back in 2013 during its breakout.

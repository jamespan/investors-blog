In June, Investor's Corner covered the [basics of a bottoming base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/).


In that story, IBD presented **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) as a stock that hit bottom in March 2009, rallied, took another brief spill, then formed a sound flat base *more than a year and a half after the March 2009 lows*.


A savvy investor needed patience for the Baltimore-based sports apparel innovator to find its footing and then hit its stride by breaking out and rushing to 52-week highs. Yet in other cases, the bottoming base may take less time. So be nimble. You might not need to wait many months, let alone years, to find a golden apple.


William O'Neil, who founded IBD in 1984, presented **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) during a two-day CAN SLIM Masters Certification seminar in Santa Monica in June 2010. Apple broke out more quickly from its bottoming base. It also revealed a subtle clue of how a future leader acts when the market is in free-fall.


The S&P 500 slid nearly nine weeks in a row from early January to March 2009. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008 and the near collapse of insurer **American International Group** ([AIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AIG)) symbolized the mortgage debt crisis. New business orders, lending and jobs came to a halt.

It also undercut a 52-week low of 741 marked in November 2008 **(1)**. During the week ended Nov. 21, Apple also reached new lows; at 79.14, the iPhone maker dropped 61% below its then all-time peak of 202.96. Nine weeks later, Apple tested that low.


But in the week ended March 6, 2009, even as the S&P 500 careened lower, undercutting the 741 low **(2)**,Apple held above its recent lows **(3)** and reversed higher. That was a truly subtle clue of strength.


On March 12, 2009, the S&P followed through, rising 4.1% in heavier volume on Day 5 of a fledgling new advance. A [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/) signals that the market may be ready to turn.


Turn it did. Just four months later, Apple roared out of a five-week flat base buy point at 146.50 on July 15 in light trade. Turnover accelerated over the next few weeks. By October 2011, Apple hit a high of 426, up 191%.

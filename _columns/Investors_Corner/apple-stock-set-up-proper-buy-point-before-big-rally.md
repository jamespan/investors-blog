So, you're ready to buy **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock or another leader you've been eyeing for months. Should you go for it? Better wait until it reaches a proper buy point.




It's tempting to jump in blindly after hearing or reading about a promising stock. And there's always a chance you'll make money on it. But IBD readers know that it pays to get in at the right time.


That's where the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) comes in. Finding the right stock is, of course, a key first step. But buying the right stock at the right time is just as important. Learning how to read a stock chart can help you identify the right time.


Investor's Corner regularly covers topics including [base patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Most stocks spend weeks, if not months, consolidating in bases. As a stock completes a base, it will set up an optimal buy point — the price at which it clears resistance and the stock could rise quickly.

Don't Forget About Volume
-------------------------


When leading stocks break out past the buy point, volume usually is at least 40% higher than usual. That signals big investors are buying as well. Common base patterns include the [cup with handle,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) and the [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/).


For these and other bases, the buy point is 10 cents above the most important resistance level on the pattern. For a cup base, it's the stock's prior high, when the correction begins. For a cup with handle, it's the highest price in the handle area. For a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-charts-difference-between-double-bottom-flat-base/), it's the middle peak of the W-shaped formation. For a flat base, it's the highest level in the entire base.


Apple Takes Two Bites
---------------------


Let's take a look at [Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/). In the summer of 2019, the stock was still recovering from a steep decline. A breakout from a cup-with-handle base on July 31 failed. Apple went right to work on a new base.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IC_pypl122120-300x161.jpg)A decline of 13% from the July 31 peak made this a flat base **(1)** and gave the pattern a 221.47 buy point **(2)**. That's 10 cents above the July 31 high. Volume was a healthy 68% above average. Apple stock dipped below the buy point for a while but never enough to trigger a sell signal **(3)**.


The stock went on to rally nearly 50% over the next four months, before pausing to build a new base. Apple, an [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) stock, is trading near all-time highs today.


What if a stock gaps above the buy point? In such a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) from a base, you can use the high of the first five minutes of trading as an alternative buy point.

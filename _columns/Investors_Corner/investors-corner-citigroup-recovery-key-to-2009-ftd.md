**IBD Special Series:** [Major Follow-Throughs](/NewsAndAnalysis/SpecialReport/572707/201105231515/Major-Follow-Throughs.aspx)

The milepost at the start of the queasy slide that set the stage for the market's March 12, 2009 comeback was an analyst's report.

  

The Oppenheimer & Co. report, dated Oct. 31, 2007, warned that **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C))would need to slash its dividend, or worse, due to its bellyful of subprime real estate loan holdings.

  

The bank's shares crumbled 8% the next day. The NYSE fell 2.8%. The effects of bundled poor-quality mortgages, later called toxic assets, metastasized. Bear Stearns imploded in March; Lehman Bros., six months later. The bear's teeth were in the bull's throat.

  

The market didn't show real signs of life until October 2008. Then, about a third of IBD's 197 industry groups bottomed and began trending higher on news of a federal rescue plan for Citibank and an \$800 billion stimulus program. E-commerce firms, chipmakers and clothing retailers were among the rebounding groups.

  

The major indexes also bounced, but in light trade. Two follow-through days, in December and January, stirred only tentative rallies. By late February, indexes were retesting multiyear lows.

  

"Trying to guess the bottom of this market is a dangerous proposition," advised the Feb. 24, 2009, Big Picture. "Let events unfold, and don't try to anticipate a comeback before there's evidence of a new uptrend."

  

In the first week of March, the NYSE composite fell another 7% after **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) said the \$13.4 billion it got in federal bailout funds weren't enough to keep it afloat. Shares slid below 1.50 each.

  

On March 6, the NYSE nicked a new low, then finished higher **1**. It ended just above the session's midpoint. The Nasdaq reversed from a 2.1% dive to end with a fractional loss. These were encouraging signs.

  

But on Monday, stocks reverted to their bearish pattern of early gains collapsing into losses. "With the correction in full swing and most leading stocks now trading below key support levels the market would need a series of strong up days in healthy volume to help turn things around," The Big Picture said after the March 9 session.

  

On March 10, Citigroup reported its first profitable month since late 2007. Shares soared 38%. The NYSE and the Nasdaq punched out 7% gains in heavy trade.

  

Two days later, solid economic data and merger deals sent the S&P 500 up 4.1%, the NYSE and Nasdaq up 4% **2**. The NYSE exchanges saw a firm increase in trading. That follow-through, five days after the indexes hit bottom, was the sendoff for a rally led initially by chipmakers, energy companies, chemical makers and retailers.

  

The bull run lifted the S&P 500 73% over the next 10 months.

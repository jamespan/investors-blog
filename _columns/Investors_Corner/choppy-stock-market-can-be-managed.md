**Handling A Choppy Uptrend:** *[Sixth In A Series](http://news.investors.com/specialreport/621258/201208071356/handling-a-choppy-uptrend.aspx)*

  

For three years, a choppy market has been part of each year's action. Yet, if you follow sound rules, the choppiness won't turn into a chain-saw massacre for your portfolio.

  

In 2010, the choppiness began in May and didn't truly end until the Sept. 1 follow-through day.

  

Last year, the choppiness began in early June, got vicious in August and then ended with the Dec. 20 follow-through day.

  

This year, the choppiness began in May, and the end isn't yet clear.

  

The end of the choppiness came early and late. The September 2010 rally was confirmed on Day 4. The December 2011 uptrend was confirmed on Day 17.

  

A successful follow-through as late as Day 17 isn't unheard of, but it is unusual. Most good follow-throughs occur on Day 4 to 7.

  

A choppy market will create more false signals, and many occur on Day 4 to 7. Also, the Market Pulse will often switch just as the indexes are about to reverse. While frustrating to both IBD writers and readers, this happens because choppy markets don't sustain a direction for long.

  

Let's take a look at the last three choppy periods.

  

In June and July 2010, there were three follow-through days with gains of 2.6% to 3.1% on the confirmation. None led to a truly profitable rally. Two didn't advance more than 1% or 2% after the confirmation. The best of the three was the July 7 confirmation that led to an additional 6% to 7% gain in the market over a month.

  

The Sept. 1, 2010, follow-through day was a winner. The Nasdaq rose as much as 19% in 51 trading days.

  

In 2011, the frustration returned. Three follow-throughs during a choppy market from May 31 through August yielded little. The gains in May and June were trivial. The August move delivered 8% over a month.

  

On Dec. 20, a true uptrend was confirmed. The Nasdaq advanced 20% in 67 sessions.

  

This year, the choppy market served up follow-through days on June 15 and June 29. Both went nowhere.

  

As The Big Picture noted at the time, there has not been a strong uptrend that began in June or July from 2000 through 2011.

  

Now for two frequently asked questions:

  

*Why does IBD even call follow-through days in June and July if the record is so weak?*

  

The answer is history. Go back further and you'll find successful June and July follow-through days in 1987 and 1994.

  

While a measure of caution is always wise, a hard-and-fast rule needs much stronger evidence.

  

*Why not raise the hurdle for a follow-through to avoid losses?*

  

No one knows which follow-through will lead to a big advance. An investor who misses a successful rally will lose more money by not playing the uptrend, or being late, than an investor will lose by nibbling at failure.

  

Consider the correct way to play an uptrend. You begin with a half position in one stock. In a \$100,000 portfolio of five stocks, the first half position is \$10,000. If the rally fails quickly, the 8% sell rule brings an \$800 loss, or a 0.8% dent in your total portfolio.

  

So, several failures in a row could put you down 2% or 3%.

  

If, however, you are late or miss a strong uptrend, you will miss out on a lot more than 2% or 3%.

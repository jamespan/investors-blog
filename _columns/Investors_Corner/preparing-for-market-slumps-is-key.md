Contrary to what many commentators say, recognizing major market tops and bottoms is possible if you closely study the major indexes' price-and-volume action. Today's column in the [current series](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) on how to analyze the stock market focuses on bear market declines. A surge in [distribution days](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/751793-distribution-days-signal-market-top-near.htm) — or significant declines in higher volume vs. the prior session — always precedes steep market falls.

  

Distribution is often preceded by increased volume without further upward price progress in the major indexes and rising volatility. Also, top stocks start to act erratically. They plunge after breaking out of late-stage bases.

  

"If the original market leaders begin to falter, and lower-priced, lower-quality, more-speculative stocks begin to move up, watch out!" William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

  

Bear markets can last three, six or nine months or as long as two or, in rare cases, three years.

  

Investors stand to lose a lot of money unless they quickly recognize the symptoms of an emerging bear market. That's because growth stocks fall 1.5 to 2.5 times faster than the overall market.

  

A 20% drop in the major averages can cause leading growth stocks to lose up to half their value. That's why you want to start moving to the sidelines as the market starts to correct.

  

The 1998 bear market began in early July, when distribution days piled up in quick succession. The S&P 500 daily chart accompanying this story shows distribution days on July 7, July 9, July 15, July 21 and July 23. The drops ranged from 0.2% to 2.1%.

  

On each occasion, the index finished in the lower half of its intraday range and in some cases just off the intraday low.

  

Five distribution days within just three weeks would have been enough to spook CAN SLIM investors into selling stocks and raising cash. Those who decided to hold would have seen the S&P 500 pierce its 50-day line in above-average volume July 31 **(1)**, another sign of weakness.

  

Those following IBD's sell rules would have been out well before Aug. 14, when the Russian debt default and subsequent failure of the highly levered hedge fund LTCM sparked a sharp leg down.

  

"If you learn to read the market and apply IBD's general market rules, there's no excuse for finding yourself down 30%, 40% or 50% or more in any bear market," O'Neil wrote.

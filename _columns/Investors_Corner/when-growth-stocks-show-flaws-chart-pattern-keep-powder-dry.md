When you wish to select the best growth stocks, do this: Be choosy.




The right way to be choosy? Focus on companies with [rip-roaring growth in earnings and sales](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/quarterly-earnings/). Prefer firms with the industry's best profit margins and [return on equity](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-analyze-growth-stocks-earnings-2019/). Now cull stocks trading near highs, no more than 5%-15% below their 52-week peaks.


You've likely encountered some exotic names for [winning chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/). They simply function to help spot the [right buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). [Cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). [Flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/), [saucer](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-bank-stocks-base-was-valid-but-formed-at-a-geological-pace/). [High tight flag](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-high-tight-flag-can-deliver-skyscraper-sized-gains/), [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/). [Ascending base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-202-how-3-retreats-may-yield-an-ascending-base/) and [IPO base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/ipo-bases-rich-gains/). The more you practice viewing, the more deftly you'll see these patterns form.



True market leaders rocket out of a [well-formed base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) to new highs. Volume booms. IBD's research has shown for decades that the biggest stock market winners — from **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)) (Costco's predecessor, Price Club, was one of [Bill O'Neil's big winners](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/sol-price-pioneered-big-box-retailing/) before founding IBD in 1984) and **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) in the 1980s to **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)) and **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) in the 1990s — form a [good base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/) before breakout day occurs.


Yet not all bases are created equal.


To reduce the risk of buying a dud, it pays to study the recent case in retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)).


Growth Stocks Can Show These Problems On A Stock Chart
------------------------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ICrh040819-300x161.jpg)This writer likes a lot of items in RH's luxury galleries, even the billiards table made of stone on the rooftop of many RH stores. Individual tastes hardly matter. What does? Full grasp of the price-and-volume action describing the level of demand (a strong will to buy) vs. supply (the eagerness to sell).


The six-month cup with handle featured just three down weeks in heavy volume. The handle showed a mild drop; volume dried up. Great! So what went wrong?


RH swung too wildly in price. In the middle of the base, RH careened more than 10% from weekly low to weekly high at least 10 times through late December **(1)**. Buyers and sellers sparred heavily. What's better is weeks of tight, dull price moves that suggest the sellers are disappearing and buyers are quietly scooping shares.


Look For These Bullish Chart Elements
-------------------------------------


A good cup should display smooth action as the left and right sides of the cup silhouette form. RH's flaw? It showed jagged edges. The cup looks like a quadruple bottom. No good. Plus its base cast a 36% drop from head to toe, too deep.



RH showed big gains in earnings per share, but sales rose 2.5% on average in each of the past four quarters. The best growth stocks tend to deliver amazing growth in both the top and bottom lines.

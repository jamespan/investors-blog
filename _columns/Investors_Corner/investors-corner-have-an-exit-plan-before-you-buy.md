*Fifth In A Series*

  

When buying stocks, most investors have one thing on their minds: "I'm going to sell for much higher than I paid for it." But guess what? Stocks don't always go up.

  

So before you hit the buy button, you need to plan everything in advance. You need to know what to do when things go wrong, too, not just when things go right.

  

No one likes losing trades, but accept them, as they are a part of investing. Following the simple yet critical rule of cutting losses at 8% will save your account from catastrophe and keep you in the game.

  

At times, you may want to exit before you have an 8% loss. For example, look for an early exit if volume is less than 40% above average on the breakout and doesn't kick in within the next few sessions. Use the capital to buy better stocks that are moving in heavy volume.

  

Consider selling out early if the market uptrend comes under pressure. Instead of waiting for an 8% loss, you might want to sell once a stock falls 3% to 5% below your purchase point.

  

When a stock works in your favor, take profits once you have gains of 20% to 25%. Write down the target price in a notebook and keep it handy. If you follow the golden sell rule and lock in gains at 20% to 25%, you can ensure a win-loss ratio of around 3-to-1.

  

If your stock breaks out and surges 20% or more within three weeks, don't just take the money and run. A stock that shows that kind of strength has the potential to go over to even bigger moves. Investors need to hold on for at least eight weeks. That'll give it ample time to move.

  

**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) cleared a 42.74 buy point from a base-on-base pattern March 28 **1** (the stock had a 2-for-1 split recently). Volume surged 184% to more than 12 million shares that day **2**, leaving no doubt a breakout occurred.

  

Days before the breakout, the yoga apparel retailer trounced estimates with a 60% jump in Q4 earnings and a 53% gain in sales.

  

Lululemon climbed just over 20% by April 21. After gaining 20% to 25%, some leaders will consolidate into new bases. That's exactly what Lululemon did **3**.

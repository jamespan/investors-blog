Dull. Boring. Do-nothing. They are not great adjectives to call someone. But if you see those traits in a stock chart, it might actually be a good thing. That lackluster action may turn into a flat base, which can be the launching pad to big stock market winners.

Like its name suggests, the flat base has a flat appearance. It should look like a rectangular box with a correction from high to low of no more than 15%. The stock looks like it's just going sideways, not doing much. This is fine, especially if a stock has had a strong prior run. It gives the stock time to catch its breath and not overheat.

The flat base is one of CAN SLIM's [shorter base patterns](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786). It only needs five weeks to take shape vs. seven weeks for the cup with handle or double bottom. To count the number of weeks, typically start counting from the first down week after a high.

The flat-base pattern shows that a stock is moving within a defined trading range. There's a certain area where the price will rise to and then back off. That's the ceiling or resistance level. There's also a level where price will fall to and then rise from — a floor or support level.

To make it easier to see the pattern, investors can draw separate horizontal lines connecting the highs and lows. [MarketSmith](https://get.investors.com/marketsmith), which requires a separate subscription, will identify a flat base and other chart patterns for you, which can be great for beginners or even seasoned investors.

The buy point in a flat base is 10 cents above the left-side high.

Sometimes, the bottom part of the pattern will be more rounded, making it look like a cup base instead. This is fine; whether it's a flat base or cup formation, the buy point will be the same.

Just like other bases, you want to see volume bulge at least 40%-50% above average when a stock breaks out of the flat base.

The flat base is usually not a first-stage structure. It tends to form after a stock breaks out from a prior pattern such as a cup, cup with handle or double-bottom. This makes sense: The sideways action marks a digestion period for the stock.

During market corrections, stocks that vacillate and form flat bases are actually showing you strength. They are not going down like most other issues under tough market conditions.

**Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) shaped a flat base in September to October 2010 **(1)**. The five-week pattern corrected by just 7% and formed after the stock broke out from a cup with handle in July.

The stock cleared the 48.06 buy point from the flat base in the week ended Oct. 15, rising 6% that week. Shares of the maker of the widely popular Monster energy drinks rose 14% before pulling back and settling into what became another flat base **(2)**.

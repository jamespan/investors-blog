Legend has it that spotting a four-leaf clover brings good luck. There is a bit more data supporting the argument that the same holds true for those who discover ascending bases.

  

An ascending base is unusual, yet tends to produce outsize winners. The base also tends to take shape during market uptrends, often in periods when the key indexes are consolidating gains.

  

The base forms after a stock breaks out of an initial base and is set on moving to higher ground. It advances, then yields in a brief consolidation as the market itself pauses.

  

It generally takes a very healthy stock to repeat that action three times, the basic requirement for an ascending base.

  

Ascending bases take on a number of different appearances, so they can be difficult to recognize.

  

The basic anatomy will include three advances, followed by pullbacks of between 10% and 20%, sometimes a little deeper. The total base generally forms over nine to 16 weeks. The length and degree of the ascending portions of the base can vary. The one clear requirement is that the low of each subsequent pullback must remain above the low of the prior plateau.

  

**Taro Pharmaceuticals** ([TARO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TARO)) built an unusual ascending base beginning in late December 2000. It was unusual because the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had topped nine months earlier, which was the beginning of the dot-com crash. Taro staged an initial breakout in July as the Nasdaq tumbled. The stock cleared another base in October **(1)**, as the Nasdaq rebounded mildly amid the unfolding bear market.

  

Taro sprinted up 76% from its October buy point to the left edge of the ascending base's first consolidation with a high of 34.94. The base's first pullback was a sharp 33% — an unusually big divot for an ascending base.

  

A solid rally set up the second pullback. That was a more tame 14% backstep. The stock charged out of that consolidation, rising 23% in a single week.

  

A 16% pullback pause over two weeks set the stage for the breakout. To chart the buy point, just add a dime to the left-side high of that last pullback. In this case, that was 44.48. The stock briefly cleared that buy point in strong trade on March 27 — a day when the Nasdaq gained 2.8%.

  

It then eased before retaking the buy point in a more decisive breakout on April 2, 2001: a 9% gain in huge trade. Taro raced 123% in fewer than four months, finally surrendering to bear-market pressures in July.

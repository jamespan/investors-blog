  Volume Should Swell Above Average On The Breakout

Some things should always go together: lock and key, nuts and bolts, Simon and Garfunkel. In investing, breakouts should always be accompanied by big volume.


There are no guarantees in investing. But you can stack the odds in your favor by lining up as many positives as possible.


So insist on seeing solid volume on a breakout. This can make the difference between a successful stock and a losing one.


Just as a car needs gas to move, a stock isn't likely to go anywhere if there isn't any power behind it. Volume tells you the level of demand or conviction behind a stock move. Simply put, the higher the level of turnover at key junctures, the better.


A large part of CAN SLIM investing involves identifying leading stocks being bought by professionals such as mutual funds and hedge funds. Armed with millions of dollars under management, it's their buying that can drive a stock substantially higher.


At a critical event such as a breakout, there should be a surge in volume. A jump in trade tells you there's solid demand for shares. A small increase generally won't cut it.


Turnover should generally be at least 40% above average on the breakout day. That's the minimum you want to see. Sometimes, volume will end up being 100%, 200% or more above average. Big spikes in volume tell you that professionals are buying with gusto.


One won't know the final volume tally until after the close, but investors can punch in a quote on Investors.com and then look at the volume % change figure to get an idea.


**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) blew past a 27.10 buy point in a double-bottom base Oct. 19, 1990 in volume that exploded 328% above average. It went on to more than double by April 1991.


**SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) broke out of a long, deep base in volume that swelled 154% above average Jan. 10, 2007. It more than doubled by August.


More recently, turnover vaulted 188% above average **1** when deep-discount carrier **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) broke out from a cup base.


Spirit had traded in huge turnover days ahead of the breakout. On Jan. 20, the company priced a secondary offering of 11 million shares at 14.50 each, a small discount to the prior session's close.

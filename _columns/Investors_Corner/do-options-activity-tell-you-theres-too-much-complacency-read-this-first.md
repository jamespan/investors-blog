They say pride cometh before the fall. So can excessive optimism or widespread complacency.


So, what about too much pessimism or a refusal to be flexible in the stock market? Such emotion or thinking can prevent even a sharp investor from entering back into the stock market at the right time.




There's also harm in relying on just one psychological indicator to decide whether we are near or at a major turning point in stocks — either on the way up or down.This is one reason why IBD furnishes a set of investor sentiment indicators. At Investors.com, [Psychological Market Indicators](http://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) is designed to help prevent you from seeing changes in investor emotion in a vacuum.


The put-call volume ratio gets discussed often in [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). At the bottom of [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), you'll see a link to a page that shows a line graph of the put-call ratio right below a large daily chart of the Nasdaq composite.

Fundamentals are extremely important in the stock market. The push and pull between equities and other financial assets is critical too. But never forget that greed, fear, hope and despair will always hold great force on the movement of stock and market index prices, particularly at market extremes.


Options Sentiment Indicators Can Help Stock Investors
-----------------------------------------------------


To figure out the [put-call ratio](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall), IBD adds up all of the put trades from the major U.S. options exchanges and divides that sum by the total volume in calls traded each day. Since puts are a contract giving the buyer the right to sell a security at a given price, they usually carry a bearish streak. Calls are generally bullish, since they give the buyer the option to buy the underlying stock at a fixed price.


Since total puts make up the numerator and total calls make up the denominator, most of the time you will see the ratio below 1.00. The natural bias of equities is up. You would expect the crowd to be generally more bullish than bearish.


So when puts are heavily traded relative to calls, you'll see the put-call volume ratio spike. As noted frequently in [IBD's The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/), a ratio hitting 1.15 or higher has proved bullish for equities in recent years. Yet a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) still gives a more reliable signal that a significant correction in stock prices has ended.


A jump in bearish sentiment is good information for investors who want to know when to buy stocks. Heavy bearishness means that more folks have bet against the market, thinking stocks will go down. When stocks keep moving up, these speculators are forced to reverse their bets and become buyers. Or they must cover short positions.


When To Buy Stocks: A Key Turning Point In Late 2016
----------------------------------------------------


The put-call ratio made some big spikes in 2016, including 1.20 on Oct. 28, just two weeks before the U.S. elections. For every 100 calls traded, investors bought 120 puts. Bears crowded the options market.


Yet soon after, the major indexes flexed strength, and the current outlook in The Big Picture switched to "uptrend resumes" from "uptrend under pressure." From its Nov. 4 low of 5034, the Nasdaq composite catapulted more than 65% through July 2019.


That Oct. 28 spike in puts vs. calls was not isolated; the put-call rose again to 1.22 on Nov. 1 and 1.21 on Nov. 4.

How low, then, is abnormally low?


A Scary Put-Call Ratio
----------------------


The Nasdaq's March 2000 top offered a historical clue.


After an Oct. 28, 1999, follow-through, the Nasdaq sprinted more than 45% higher in less than 10 weeks. By Jan. 14, 2000, the put-call shrank to 0.38 **(1)**. Nearly two months later on March 10, the ratio hit a low of 0.36 **(2)**. In other words,  optimism was running so high that for every bearish put traded, nearly three bullish calls exchanged hands.


The Nasdaq peaked on March 10, 2000, at 5132, as institutional selling sharpened and multiple days of heavy distribution days popped up over a short time frame. The tech-rich index fell 78% over the next two years and seven months.


The Market In 2018 And 2019
---------------------------



In September 2018, the put-call ratio fell nowhere near the 0.36-0.38 level seen 18 years ago. But a ratio of 0.69 marked the lowest level since January the same year. That's still a sharp drop from a 1.27 peak seen in February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq had chalked up seven distribution days by September. The stock eventually buckled. IBD's current outlook for stocks went to "Uptrend under pressure" on Oct. 4 and "Market in correction" on Oct. 10.


The Nasdaq fell nearly 24% from its then all-time peak of 8133 by Christmas Eve.


This year, the [put-call made a low of 0.60 on June 20](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=putcall).

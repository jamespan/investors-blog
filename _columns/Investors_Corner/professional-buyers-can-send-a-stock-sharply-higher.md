If you need to tear up a giant slab of concrete, a small chisel and elbow grease simply aren't going to cut it. You're going to need something bigger.

In the stock market, it's not a buy order for 500 shares from Aunt Suzy or Uncle Bob that'll drive a stock sharply higher. It's going to take a lot more demand to get something really going.

It's going to take buying from professional investors such as mutual funds, hedge funds and pensions to really move a stock. This is the idea behind the "I" in CAN SLIM, which stands for institutional sponsorship.

Besides scouting a stock's fundamentals or looking at its chart, investors also need to see whether there's support from the big guns. With millions of dollars or more put to work, it's the institutions that have to firepower to substantially move a stock higher for weeks or months at a time.

When professionals buy in serious amounts, it's not a flash-in-the pan move for a day or two. It may take weeks or longer for banks, mutual funds and insurers to build up to a full position. They are so big that they can not buy too many shares at a time without driving prices up too much.

On the flip side, the pros can send a certain issue cratering when they decide that it's time to exit. Institutions focus on higher-priced, more liquid names. Individual investors should do the same. Buy stocks that are priced at least 10 or 20 a share and have average daily trading volumes of at least 400,000 shares.

You want to see two keys when evaluating sponsorship: more of it and high-quality sponsors. There's no magic number when it comes to sponsorship. But demand a trend of increasing sponsorship. The Stock Checkup tool on Investors.com will tell you the percentage change in the number of mutual funds owning shares, as well as the number of quarters of increasing fund ownership.

While increasing ownership is nice, also check out the quality of the sponsors. The funds should be top performers, preferably with A or B Ratings.

**Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) had solid institutional backing. Mutual fund ownership grew to 415 funds in Q3 of 2013 from 295 three quarters before that. The stock initially cleared a 35.26 handle buy point in the week ended Oct 4. But it didn't take off until the following week **(1)**. Before that big move up, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating scored a solid A-.

A decent base is nice, but it's not a 100% guarantee of hefty profits in the future.

You might come across a stock that fashions the best-looking pattern you've seen in months. The base might show tight price action, low volume during the down weeks, and evidence of heavy buying from the institutional crowd.

That's all great, but in some cases it's still not enough.

If the market is on the verge of crossing into bear territory, or the stock has already made a huge run, keep your powder dry and your eyes peeled on the chart action.

Before buying any stock, first make sure the market is rising in a sound manner. This gives stocks on your watch list a tail wind. But if the market uptrend is under severe pressure and the stock is not acting right, stand ready to cut your loss or lock in your gain.

**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) offers a prime example of why it pays to stay flexible. The fast-growing Latin American e-commerce firm formed a five-week flat base that showed many positive attributes. The 11% decline was mild.

In the week ended May 6, MercadoLibre fell 3% in heavy trade. But it closed that week well within the upper half of the range **1**. That's a sign of funds accumulating shares. Two other down weeks saw light volume, another good sign **2**.

The stock also bounced off its 10-week moving average as the base formed. Despite all these positives, MercadoLibre never broke out. The market was in a correction, as The Big Picture's Market Pulse noted at the time. That alone is good reason not to buy.

Another worry: MercadoLibre had already built a long advance since reaching an all-time low of 7.91 in November 2008. The stock built several bases along the way. The rallies that followed each breakout were far from smooth, particularly during the middle of 2010. Nevertheless, the latest base was late-stage.

Another subtle sell signal came in the form of slowing profit growth.

In Q2 2010, earnings per share leapt 125%, then grew 76%, 38%, 45% and 26% over the next four quarters. Before earnings growth slowed to 26% in Q2 2011, MercadoLibre plunged 12% and pierced its 10-week line in heavy volume **3**.

As of Monday, analysts see earnings off 1% vs. year-ago levels at 43 cents a share despite a 41% revenue increase.

What do **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) have in common with the fertilizer giant **Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT))?


The short answer: At various points in history, all three met the N in IBD's [CAN SLIM investment method](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749).


Of these seven characteristics of winning stocks, laid out by [IBD founder William J. O’Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), the N can be one of the more difficult to nail down. It stands for "new" and encompasses a lot of different aspects of a company. It's more than simply checking to see if a company can surpass purely quantitative thresholds.


The N can stand for new products and services, such as Apple's launch of the iPod in Apple’s 2002 fiscal year. Sales of iPods accounted for 2.5% of revenue that year compared to the 79% of sales coming from Apple's Macintosh products. By 2006, Macintosh products shrank to 38.2% of revenue. The iPod? It shot up to 39.7%.


That shift in revenue prompted then-CEO Steve Jobs to drop “computer” from the Apple Computer name in 2007, coinciding with the announcement of the new Apple TV and iPhone. The earnings growth fueled by these new products contributed to a move of over 7,000% from 2004 to 2015.


When Alphabet made its debut as Google on August 19, 2004, it exhibited another aspect of the N: It was a new issue.


Initial public offerings within the past eight to 15 years tend to be a hot spot of growth for stock market leaders. When Google went public, it already had an incredible record of profit and sales growth. They not only had a winning search engine, but also knew how to monetize it.


**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) had its IPO on April 21, 1965, launching a phenomenal run. But with over 36,000 locations in 100 countries in 2015, what could McDonalds offer now that is new?


McDonald's has new top management, which is often a catalyst for stock moves. Steve Easterbrook became CEO in March 2015, and since taking over, he has been instituting changes. All-day breakfast, more customization with burgers and healthier choices all led to a 20% move for the company since Easterbrook took over. Earnings have turned around from four consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year declines (-28%, -19%, -17% and -10%) to two consecutive quarters of double-digit gains.


Which finally brings us to fertilizer companies like Potash. What could they offer that was new?


In 2006, fertilizers saw a new condition in their industry. The huge populations of China, India and other emerging market economies were seeing a rising middle class and a change to a higher-protein diet rather than one dominated by starch. Significantly more crop production is required to feed the animals that are part of a higher animal protein-based diet. At the same time, rising oil prices were fueling greater demand for biofuels like ethanol, which in turn, also required more crops.


By 2007, corn plantings surged to their highest level in 60 years, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Corn, wheat and soy were selling at all-time highs, spurring farmers to try to increase production. But with only half the farm land available compared to the 1950s, production increases became heavily reliant on -- you guessed it, fertilizers. With limited supplies of potash, nitrogen and phosphate and high barriers to entry for mining costs, Potash cashed in on the limited supply and rising demand. The Canadian firm enjoyed a nearly 600% increase in its stock price from 2006 through 2008.


The final aspect of N has to do with technical action. Look for stocks that are trading at or near new highs. This ensures you are looking at stocks that are truly in favor by large institutional investors. Leading stocks tend to trend, so the ones making new highs tend to go higher. IBD's New High list (today on page B1) will keep you on top of the major sectors of stocks producing new highs.

As an earlier [Investor's Corner column](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) explained, the [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) carries a sort of Swiss watch-like intricacy.

The shape, dimensions, depth of decline, slope of the incline, price-and-volume interplay and other details help determine the quality of a stock that etches this important chart pattern.

Not all [cup-with-handle bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) pan gold. So an investor should train his or her eyes for flaws that may result in a market malfunction.

Put another way, if you learn to sidestep the poorly formed ones, then you reduce the likelihood of taking a loss in your future buys. Fewer losses on individual stocks boost your overall return.

As seen in the accompanying daily chart of **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) back during its base-building phase in 2016, the stock's breakout from a seven-week shallow [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) didn't work.

![icpayc010917](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ICpayc010917.png)

The Oct. 24, 2016, breakout past a 51.56 entry point lasted barely longer than a day. Eight days into the move, Paycom plunged more than 15% despite good Q3 results (EPS up 88%, revenue up 40%).

Why didn't this cup with handle work out?

A major reason was how Paycom formed the base. The handle showed a proper light decline of 6.5%, less than the 12% drop within the cup portion.

Yet the overall shape of this cup with handle was distorted. Paycom spent less than three weeks building the left side of the cup, then took just five trading sessions to form the cup's right side. In contrast, the handle portion took nearly four weeks to form. Such action rarely has shown up among decades of IBD's model studies on the biggest stock market winners.

The opposite should occur. A stock should take plenty of time to form the cup, and much less time to finish up the handle.

Paycom gained a lot of attention in IBD's screens and coverage since its April 2014 debut. In the week ended Nov. 7, 2014, the payroll and human resources management firm glided past a 19.34 buy point in a six-week cup base. That base formed next to a longer initial base. Just 12 months later, Paycom hit a new high of 46.35, up 140%.

Over the same time frame, the NYSE composite fell 3.3%.

A large correction from late 2015 to early 2016 sent the stock plunging 52% from a 46.35 peak to as low as 22.42. That's a big enough drop to [reset the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/this-medical-hot-rod-peaked-in-2008-after-5-bases-can-it-lead-stocks-again/). However, Paycom had created a long series of [bases-on-top-of-bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) throughout 2015, and its long-term uptrend since hitting all-time highs in September 2014 was still largely intact. One could conclude that the most recent breakout came quite late in the stock's long-term run.

Fast-forward to today, and Paycom has now rallied out of a new bullish chart pattern, the [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/). The buy point is 259.81, a dime above the cup's left-side lip.

So long as the stock market remains in a solid confirmed uptrend, then, [buying breakouts as close as possible to the proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) is the essence of CAN SLIM investing. Paycom's [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) goes up to 272.80, 5% above the 259.81 entry.

America is known as the land of second chances. The country's stock market is known for giving them too. If you miss a breakout in heavy volume, don't worry about it. Stocks often pull back to or near their proper buy points, giving another sound opportunity to buy.

  

Even when a top-quality stock is extended in price — specifically, more than 5% past a proper entry — sometimes it will pull back into a buy range. And when the market is in a confirmed uptrend, it's OK to buy.

  

**The 2nd Or 3rd Chance**

  

A pullback in light volume is preferable to a pullback in heavy volume. The former indicates the stock's foundation of institutional investor support is still strong. Few holders are willing to dump their positions. The latter can be indicative of an unhealthy market — one where institutional selling is causing strong headwinds.

  

Other times, a stock will pull back and fall below a buy point. It doesn't mean the breakout is doomed, particularly when the 8%-loss [sell rule](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/756865-cutting-losses-stock-market-insurance-policy.htm) is not triggered.

  

In fact, strong stocks can quickly recover and regain the buy point, presenting another buying opportunity. Demand heavy volume when a stock reclaims a buy point. If volume is light, it's a more risky buy.

  

Some breakouts are easy to hold. Others are more volatile and can shake you out.

  

The ones that are easier to hold often occur in the early stages of a new market uptrend. After a meaningful bear market in the major averages that wiped the slate clean of sellers, institutional investors are eager to put money to work. The buying provides a good foundation in stocks. In this case, stocks generally won't have a hard time holding above buy points. Some will come back to buy points, but plenty of others will show strength, refusing to give up much ground.

  

But breakouts that occur in the later stages of bull markets tend not to work as well because institutional buying isn't as pronounced. In such a case, it's more common to see stocks pull back to buy points. They'll dither around the buy point, or fall below it, but a new wave of buying will help the stock reclaim the buy point, providing a second chance to get in.

  

Make sure you are always focused on the best stocks in terms of fundamentals.

  

The past two years have been challenging for growth investors. Breakouts have had a mixed record at best. But it's not all that surprising when you consider the bull market that started in March 2009 has been running for a while.

  

Even the biggest stock market winners come back to buy points. IBD research shows that 40% of them do.

  

In January 2010, **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 92.10. It rallied 8% past the buy point. It notched three straight weekly price declines after that but only gave up 4%. It was an orderly decline, and the pullback allowed new buyers who missed the initial breakout to enter the stock because Chipotle was back in a buy range, within 5% of the buy point.

  

The next week, shares surged 10% in double its average weekly trade **(1)**. Chipotle rallied 199% in just 13 months.

When evaluating a stock's fundamentals, it's good to ask the question: What have you done for me for lately? If a consistent track record of strong earnings-per-share growth is in place, it's also good to ask the question: What are you going to do for me going forward?

  

In this case, it's good to know what kind of EPS growth is expected in the current quarter and full year.

  

Fundamentals drive a stock's price performance. Big quarterly EPS and sales growth, high return on equity and peak [profit margins](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/754075-look-for-high-and-rising-profit-margins.htm) are all important, but positive growth prospects also matter.

  

The minimum annual EPS estimate to look for is +15%, although many aggressive growth names will show year-over-year gains stronger than that.

  

It's good to see strong growth for the current year as well as the following the year.

  

If it's 20%+ for both years, you're fishing in the right pond.

  

Be careful not to look at quarterly and annual estimates in a vacuum. Just because a stock is expected to boost quarterly earnings by 50% and annual earnings by 30% doesn't mean it's a buy. Growth like this doesn't mean much if institutional investors are heavily selling the stock.

  

Estimates data can be found throughout the pages of IBD as well as Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Quarterly earnings estimates show up in the Sector Leader mini charts each day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, they're also in [IPO Leaders](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm).

  

Quarterly and annual estimates are available for every IBD 50 stock. The screen is published every Monday and Wednesday in IBD

  

In a recent IBD 50, nearly half the names on the list were expected to increase annual earnings by at least 25% in their current fiscal year.

  

But be careful. Big estimates don't always go hand in hand with a strong stock.

  

According to Thomson Reuters, second-quarter profit at **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) is seen as rising 59% from a year ago. Full-year earnings are expected to jump 75% from 2014. Strong growth, indeed, but with Southwest shares under distribution and now below the 200-day moving average, the market might be concerned about a sharp deceleration in annual earnings growth in 2016. Southwest's annual profit is seen as rising only 3%.

  

The IBD Big Cap 20 is published every Tuesday in IBD. In a recent list, 15 out of 20 names were expected to boost annual earnings by at least 10%. That's pretty respectable for a large-cap stock. Keep in mind that as companies get bigger, it's tough to maintain strong growth rates.

  

An exception is **Valeant Pharmaceuticals** ([VRX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRX)), with a market capitalization of north of \$80 billion. Second-quarter earnings are seen rising 29% from a year ago. Even more impressive, full-year profit at the ethical drug giant is expected to jump 34% this year and 39% in 2016.

  

**Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) are other large-cap names with top fundamentals that are expected to show healthy growth this year and next.

  

Wall Street analysts see Salesforce's earnings jumping 37% to 71 cents a share in fiscal 2016 (ending in January) and Illumina's EPS up 25% this year to \$3.43.

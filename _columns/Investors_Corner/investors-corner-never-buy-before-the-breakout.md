  Investor's Corner: Never Buy Before The Breakout

Sometimes, it just doesn't pay to jump the gun.

  

Crossing an intersection before the light turns green, or biting into an orange before it's ripe may lead to an unpleasant experience.

  

Likewise, avoid buying a stock before it breaks out of a base.

  

While it's nice to say that you bought a good stock "way down there," it's not about buying low. It's about buying right.

  

That means buying when there's solid demand.

  

The correct time to buy is when a stock breaks out of a sound base in volume that is at least 40% above its 50-day average. The strong volume shows that institutional investors are buying the stock at this critical juncture. They are the ones with the firepower to send shares significantly higher.

  

Sure, it can be tempting to buy before the breakout, but resist the urge.

  

Let's say you've found a stock with excellent fundamentals that is set up in a picture-perfect cup-with-handle base. The current quote is still several points below the proper buy point.

  

But everything looks so good, you think of buying before the professionals start buying. That's wrong.

  

Some stocks never finish the right side of their bases and never stage breakouts.

  

They may vacillate, or just keep declining until a new buying area emerges. That's why it's important to let the stock show you there's strong demand before you jump in. The breakout acts as a confirmation that institutional investors want to buy shares, a good sign that the stock has sufficient demand to sustain an advance into new highs.

  

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) never broke out from a deep cup-with-handle base it formed from January to May 2008.

  

The stock corrected 43% **1** as recession fears sent the market into a tailspin.

  

Shares seemed to form a handle over several weeks **2**, but rather than make new highs, Apple kept drifting and never reached the potential buy point at 192.34. Investors who tried to buy on the cheap would just watch the "handle" get deeper and deeper.

  

By late November 2008, the stock tumbled nearly 60% from the would-be buy point. The market's correction worsened, and it wasn't until July 2009 that Apple was able to make its next solid breakout.

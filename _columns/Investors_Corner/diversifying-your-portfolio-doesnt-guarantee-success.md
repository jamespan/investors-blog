  Diversifying Your Portfolio Doesn't Guarantee Success

"Don't put all your eggs in one basket." In stock investing, this conventional wisdom just isn't right. Diversification is highly touted as a way to reduce risk. In the world of stocks, this means buying many companies across a broad spectrum of industry groups.


The idea is that if one or two take a tumble, investors won't get badly hurt. While this can be true, understand that diversification has some serious drawbacks.


One, diversification can dilute your returns. Academia states that a portfolio starts to reap the benefits of diversification at about 20 stocks. But at this point, your returns will be watered down.


If you have one or two big winners that surge 50% or 100% in an equally weighted portfolio of 20 stocks, you will hardly feel a thing. The performance of the big winners will be drowned out by the rest of the holdings.


In a major bear market, even diversification won't save you. As 2008 showed, nearly every stock will go down. There is really is no place to turn to, but cash.


Two, it's tough to really understand the intricacies of that many companies and keep up with them. Sure, institutional investors often own hundreds of stocks in a single fund. But they have entire research and trading departments to track them week in, week out.


Diversification can also involve branching out into other asset classes, such as bonds or commodities. But there is no guarantee to what they'll do. Even commodities took a broad hit during the financial meltdown in 2008.


"Broad diversification is plainly and simply often a hedge for ignorance," wrote IBD chairman and founder William O'Neil in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


Instead of casting a wide net, concentrate in only a few leading stocks. Invest only in companies with the fastest earnings and sales growth rates. They should have cutting-edge products or services and belong in top-rated industry groups. This is especially important in a strong bull market.


In a market downturn, sell and protect your hard-earned profits. Sell your stock if it falls 8% or more from where you bought it. Don't let any gain turn into a loss. Why? The rally may be permanently finished.

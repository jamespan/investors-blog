IBD Leaderboard can help you make money — no matter how you use it.


You can focus your portfolio on the Leaders list and save yourself a mountain of time-intensive work. Or you can check with Leaderboard as a way of comparing your own research.


Leaderboard, IBD's new premium product that is available only [online via Investors.com](https://www.investors.com/products/default.aspx?id=ldb-n&src=APA1BQ8), appears in three main segments: Leaders, Top 10 and the Cut List.


To make the Leaders List, a stock must pass a blistering vetting process. Virtually every facet of the company and its stock is examined by IBD's team of markets writers and editors with the sort of scrutiny you'd expect from the police at a crime scene. Every piece of evidence is analyzed in the relentless pursuit of uncovering the market's very best stocks.


This is nothing new to you. CAN SLIM investors have long been doing the very same thing. Now you can count among your assets — IBD, investors.com, MarketSmith — one more partner: IBD's markets team, a crew of seasoned CAN SLIM analysts. We live and breathe this stuff.


So you could drop all your work and trust us. Well, what would be the fun in that?


IBD has always strived to make readers savvy independent traders. But, you might prefer to match your results with ours. Just continue with your own efforts and see what you come up with. Remember, you only need to watch two small items: technicals and fundamentals.


In fact, that's a lot. The former includes the chart. Ask: Is the stock trading tightly? What sort of base is it forming? How are the price-volume action and the up-down volume ratio? Can you find signs that the big funds are accumulating positions? Is there too much high-volume selling?


Now watch the fundamentals: What is the company's earnings and sales growth like? Single-digits gains won't do you much good. How are its margins and return on equity? Is its long-term-debt load too big?


Take your bottom-line list of very best stocks and match them against the Leaderboard Leaders list. Now it gets interesting.


Why do you have 10 stocks that don't appear on Leaderboard? Maybe we missed something. But you too must consider that you missed something. And why did Leaderboard come up with a stock or two that you hadn't caught? Find out what you missed, and you will have learned a valuable lesson.

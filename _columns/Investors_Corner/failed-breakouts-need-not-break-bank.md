Today's Investor's Corner kicks off a short series of articles detailing why some breakouts fail and how to handle them when they do.

Failures are not at all unusual. They are generally simple to handle so long as you cut losses and keep a careful eye on your quarry.

Teen retail chain **Rue 21** ([RUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RUE)) staged what looked like a very solid breakout on July 7 last year **1** (weekly chart is shown). The five-month cup with handle was just 23% deep. The base was a first-stage pattern, and the stock had been public for less than two years, also a plus.

But some red flags were waving.

Institutional activity over the course of the base was skewed toward distribution. This activity rippled into the handle. **2** The volume, rather than drying up along the length of the handle, was jerky, with heavier weekly volume on the downside. This isn't the kind of orderly shakeout you like to see ahead of a breakout.

The handle also dipped nearly 15%, beyond the 12% limit that defines a well-behaved stock.

The breakout, a powerful 8% spike in better than double its average trade, past a 34.93 buy point did not erase these elements of risk.

Rue rose for two days, then began a rapid pullback in generally light trade. It dropped to a test of 50-week support, violating the 8% sell rule July 27. **3** Technically, this marked a failed breakout.

In real terms, the breakout still had a fighting chance. A great many breakouts — particularly in the challenging market of late — have pulled back below the 8% loss level, then reversed to retake the buy point and move on to new highs.

Recent examples include **Hi Tech Pharmacal** ([HITK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HITK)) and **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) in September and October. More recently, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Nuskin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) and **W.W. Grainger** ([GWW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GWW)) have recovered after triggering the golden sell rule to retake new highs.

The lesson: Keep your eye on the ball, even if it has failed.

Rue's death knell came in the first two sessions of August. **4** The stock cut its 50-day moving average with a big loss in mildly above-average trade Aug. 1 (please see a daily chart). On Aug. 2, it sliced its 200-day line with an even larger drop in heavier volume.

The stock has since failed to regain its 50-day moving average. It's 42% below the July buy point.

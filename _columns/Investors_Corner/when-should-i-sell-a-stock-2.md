  Change In Stock's Character Says It's Time To Sell

The specialty steel industry group enjoyed a great run from 2003 to 2007, posting a 1900% increase.


Makers of specialty alloys inhabit a different world from steel producers. Alloys involve high-tech materials, sometimes protected by patents. Much of the business is tied to the aerospace cycle.


Within the group, few stocks had a more dramatic price advance than Pittsburgh-based **Allegheny Technologies** ([ATI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATI)). The stock bottomed at 2.10 in March 2003. In April 2007, Allegheny peaked at 119.70, a 5,600% increase.


When amateur investors see a historical gain like that, they wonder how to duplicate it. Then they are off rummaging among the \$2 stocks.


Savvy investors don't think like that, and the way you think is everything in investing. Realistic investors don't expect a Van Gogh painting to show up at a yard sale, and neither do they expect to find the next big winner among the \$2 stocks.


Yes, turnaround stocks sometimes hit lows of 2, as Allegheny shows. But many more are like **Radio Shack** ([RSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RSH)), which hit 2 in January this year and now trades under 1.


Odds are more favorable when a stock satisfies several conditions. A prior uptrend of at least 30%, a strong breakout from a solid base, a stock price of 12 or higher, a new factor and strong fundamentals are necessary.


During a long price run, the goal is to get in the stock and hold on as long as possible, even holding through some base building.


Some IBD-style investors prefer not to sit through a consolidation. They prefer to take profits regularly and re-enter the stock as it breaks out of a new base. That's an acceptable strategy as well.


Yet a long run challenges investors in another way: How does an investor know when to exit the stock for good?


A change in the stock's character is the decisive factor.


As a stock rises, sketching bases along the way, certain characteristics repeat. In Allegheny's case, the bases were mostly minimal in length — often cups without handles. Blue weeks in volume within the base generally outnumbered the red weeks.


The first breakout — after a prior uptrend of at least 30% and after the stock price rose above 12 — came in June 2004 (please see a historical chart) as Allegheny cleared a 13.05 buy point in a cup without handle.


Additional breakouts occurred in 2004-05. Whether the individual sat tight through the bases or traded around the breakouts, the stock was a moneymaker.


The easy money came after the stock reset the base count in mid-October 2005. A November 2005 breakout from a cup led to a 24-week advance with neither a pause to build a base nor a decline that touched the 10-week line. The gain was 178% from the 31.48 ideal buy point.


The stock consolidated and broke out again past 83.25 in late November 2006. A 44% run-up to April 2007 followed, though there were some shallow consolidations that an investor would've had to hold through.


Allegheny's character changed in the next consolidation. The pattern was dominated by down weeks in heavy volume **(1)** and some very wide price swings. The stock began to roll over in October 2007 **(2)** and by January 2008 was 51% off its high.

  How You Can Win In A Choppy Stock Market Uptrend

In a bear market, no bullish strategy will work consistently. Most stocks will go down, and the wisest choice is to sit out as much of the down cycle as possible. In a strong bull market, buying fares much better. And in a choppy or sideways market, stocks can be bought, but excellent portfolio management skills are needed.


How can an investor use IBD to make money in a choppy uptrend?


Look for quality institutional support. Insist on a solid [EPS Stability Factor](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-income-investor.htm) (numerous stocks covered in The Income Investor feature it). And look for action or inaction that drives out weak holders.


In May 2012, **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) had a long base, quality institutional support and a five-year EPS Stability Factor of 9 on a scale that runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild). Here's how it could've been played:


• **Buy**: On May 4, 2012, an IBD article on Disney noted that a 14-month-long base offered a potential buy point at 44.60. The base was long, and as the article said, "such bases have fewer weak holders." (Time wears them out.)


The stock broke out May 9 in fast trade. After the breakout, the stock eased 2.4% below the entry but never triggered a sell rule. A buyer was able to sit tight.


• **Sell**: On Sept. 28, 2012 **(1)**, IBD noted that Disney had risen as much as 19.7% above its 44.60 buy point and individual investors "could consider taking profits."


• **Buy**: On Jan. 24, 2013 **(2)**, an IBD story noted, "After three sessions of trying to clear a 52.43 buy point, Walt Disney got the job done." Clearing the buy point provided an opportunity to re-enter the stock.


• **Sell**: The stock rose 29% in four months, making a sale at the usual 20% to 25% profit-taking zone possible in May **(3)**.


• **Buy**: On July 15, 2013, an IBD article pegged a new entry point at 67.99. The entry point required a watch list and patience. The stock didn't break out in volume until Nov. 8, 2013.


• **Sell**: The stock rose 23% in four months, reaching the profit-taking zone in the same time period.


• **Pass**: IBD didn't mention the next potential entry because it was in a later-stage base. The stock broke out in June 2014. It didn't rise much before consolidating.


• **Pass**: A three-weeks-tight pattern in early January this year would've been tough to play. Trade on the breakout at 96.03 was below the 40% minimum volume spike. The stock fell 6% below the entry before rising to good gains. Technically, an investor could've held through the 6% retreat, but realistically, many IBD-style investors will dump a stock before it triggers the 8% sell rule. The 8% rule is designed to make 8% the worst loss, not the typical loss.


Even if he'd missed that last move, the investor who played the three buy and sell signals could've had three 20% or more gains.


Three more points: One, Disney might have seemed too conservative to fit the aggressive trader's preference. Yet in a choppy market, steady stocks are easier to hold.


Two, an investor can do well without getting all of the move. Restraint is prudent in a choppy market.


Three, using the rule to take profits at 20%-25% makes sense in a choppy market. Sitting through a correction is risky when market gains are hard to come by.

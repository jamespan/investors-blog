When it comes to investing, it starts with choosing [which stocks to buy](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener/). Equally important is knowing when to buy them. The same applies to selling. Knowing when to sell is critical to [managing risk](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-investing-ibd-methodology/) while maximizing gains.

The good news is that stocks offer timely buy and sell clues through [chart patterns and indicators](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-read-stock-charts-understanding-technical-analysis/), as we'll discuss using **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock.

A basic chart indicator is the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The line is a simple average of the stock's closing price over the past 50 sessions. The 10-week moving average is its cousin on weekly charts. Traders see them as important levels of support, where stocks often bounce into greater heights.

## 50-Day Moving Average As Sell Signal

But it is also smart to flip that strategy and use the 50-day (or 10-week line) as a sell signal. When a stock that has been trending higher for months breaks below its 50-day moving average, that suggests institutional selling is occurring, especially if the break happens in [heavy volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/).

That's a more-decisive break of support than if a stock just trickles down in lighter volume. When the former happens, watch for further weakening to happen quickly. But a minor slip below the 50-day line in lighter volume could mean the stock will recover.

Also, when the weakening action is confirmed by other indicators such as the [up/down volume ratio](https://education.investors.com/financialdictionary.aspx?mode=1&term=Up%2fDown+Volume+Ratio&termid=1) or the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20the%20relative%20strength,with%20the%20Relative%20Strength%20Rating.), you have greater confidence in taking profits.

Subtler signs of weakening action can be seen when the 50-day moving average starts sloping downward or crosses below the 200-day moving average.

On IBD Charts and [MarketSurge,](https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?artProdLink=MarketSurge) the 50-day and 10-week moving averages are plotted with a red line.

## Apple Stock Dives Below Key Level

![apple](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IC090224-300x167.jpg)In the first half 2023, Apple went on a tear, rising more than 50% through mid-July. Throughout the entire run, Apple stock held above its 10-week moving average **(1)**.

But on Aug. 4, 2023, Apple gapped below the 50-day and 10-week moving averages in heavy volume, which was a clear sell signal **(2)**. The company's fiscal third-quarter [sales declined](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-drops-as-iphone-maker-sales-decline-again/) for a third consecutive quarter while earnings grew only 5%. The iPhone maker also gave a weak outlook.

The 10-week line started sloping downward and also became a level of resistance **(3)** as shares failed to rally past it twice in September and October.

If investors sold the stock at the 181.99 closing price on Aug. 4, they would have saved themselves a 9% decline to the Oct. 26 low at 165.67. More importantly, investors who sold avoided a tough trek for Apple stock in which shares spent months consolidating and didn't make new highs until June of this year.

Investors didn't think much about Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" comment in 1996. It came right in the middle of a roaring bull market where tech stocks were making multiyear stratospheric gains.


While Greenspan, who would stay on as chairman of the Federal Reserve an additional 10 years, was early with his warning, excessive euphoria was what ultimately caused the tech bubble to burst in 2000. This wasn't the first time it happened, and it won't be the last.


Excessive media coverage and hype can come when a stock is at or near a top. Use this knowledge to your advantage and treat it as a time to look for important sell signals on a chart.


It happened to **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) in the summer of 2011 when it topped after a lengthy run-up. By the end of the year, the stock had lost three-quarters of its value. CEO Reed Hastings was featured on the cover of Fortune in December 2010.


When the media latch on to a big winner, it's often too late. The coverage often comes after a big price run. By then, everyone is already familiar with the company's growth story.


In May 2014, Michael Kors appeared on the cover of London's Sunday Times Magazine. The headline read: "The \$3 Billion Bag Man." He's currently honorary chairman and chief creative officer at **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)).


The "affordable luxury" brand was a big winner after its IPO in December 2011. It went public at 20 a share and more than quintupled in price in just 27 months.


The price move was warranted, as the company consistently produced robust earnings and sales increases, taking solid market share away from **Coach** ([COH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COH)).


Kors' cover appearance came just ahead of a precipitous stock decline. Shares slumped fast on May 29 right after Wall Street digested Kors' quarterly earnings report **(1)**. Big earnings and sales growth was there again, but concerns about profit margins brought sellers into the stock.


Kors is still in growth mode, but the company hasn't been able to shake off margin concerns. Since late May, the stock is down 22%.


On June 16 it joined the Cut List on [IBD Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/).


Today its RS Rating is 19 out of a maximum 99.


Keep in mind that Kors is still a relatively new company with plenty of growth opportunities ahead. But for now, the stock has relinquished leadership status in the market.

In an uptrending market like this one, the chief worries are twofold.

  

For a stock that investors already own, the worry in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/stock-market-today) is how long they should stay with the stock. For a stock that investors are considering buying, the worry is buying a winner just before it corrects.

  

One tool that can help investors is the relative strength line. The RS line shows how the stock price is behaving in relation to the S&P 500. A rising RS line means the stock is outperforming the index — either by losing less than the index or gaining more than the index.

  

The Big Cap 20 has several stocks that sport rising RS lines.

  

**Priceline.com**'s ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) relative strength line has been rising since late April. The line is near a 52-week high.

  

Two concerns surround the online travel arranger. First, earnings growth has slowed. From 2003 through 2011, annual EPS growth never dropped below 43%.

  

However, last year earnings grew 33%. The Street expects earnings to expand 25% this year and 20% in 2014.

  

Second, the recent breakout came from a fourth-stage base, according to MarketSmith's pattern-recognition technology.

  

As a stock advances over many months, it takes time to pause or form a new base. Breakouts from a first- or second-stage pattern have a better chance of succeeding than those from later-stage bases.

  

Priceline is extended from its most recent buy point, which means it should not be bought. For investors who own shares, the rising RS line is a reason to hold. But the fourth-stage pattern and declining earnings growth suggest expectations should be kept modest.

  

Internet content provider **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) also features a rising RS line. The RS line has been advancing since early May and is near a 52-week high.

  

Google's earnings growth slowed in the past two years — from 28% EPS growth in 2010 to 22% in 2011 and 11% last year.

  

However, the Street expects earnings to grow 15% this year and 16% in 2014.

  

Google is extended about 8% from an 844.10 buy point. Once again, a stock more than 5% beyond a buy point should not be bought. The small rebound in earnings growth combined with a rising RS line give shareholders a rationale to keep holding.

  

The RS line of **Moody's** ([MCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCO)) has been rising since mid-February.

  

This stock broke out April 29 in big volume, the same day that IBD declared that the uptrend had resumed. Moody's is 22% past a 55.68 buy point.

  

In Moody's case, the RS line merely confirms a more important factor. The stock needed only 13 sessions to climb 20% above the buy point. A stock that rises 20% above the entry in three weeks or less should be held for eights weeks, then re-evaluated. Only a clear sell signal can override that hold rule.

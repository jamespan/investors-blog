  Why The Dow In 2014 Isn't 1929 In Charts

A frightening chart currently showing up on some financial websites and publications compares the Dow Jones industrial average in the 1920s to the current Dow. The implication is clear: A 1929-style crash is around the corner.


Beware. The chart is deceptive.


Based on comparisons of the Dow over a two-year period, some market observers argue the current Dow seems to be mimicking every twist, turn and hiccup of the 85-year-old pattern.


But the price scale of the current chart has been magnified. When the two charts are put in the proper perspective with comparable percentage changes, the eerie comparison fades away.


Now consider the Dow for an even longer period of time, from 1924-29 and 2008-2014. This comparison includes an even greater ascent in both eras. Yet as IBD's indexed chart shows, the Dow made a much bigger climb during the "Roaring 20s."


This is why it's important to not get sucked into media hype. Read The Big Picture column and focus on the day-to-day action of the market and leading stocks to know what the forward-moving trend will truly be.


A similar chart made the rounds in the aftermath of the 1987 crash. It showed the run-ups in 1929 and 1987, the crashes and the weak recoveries in both, then the horrible slide to a 1932 low. The implication was that 1988 and 1989 would be like 1930-32. Instead, stocks worked their way higher in 1988, setting the stage for a fine rally in 1989.


History repeats itself, and comparisons with similar epochs can be useful. Take the 1920s and 1930s Dow compared to the 1990s and 2000s Nasdaq. The comparison is close. The two periods have important parallels. In the 1920s, American life was being remade with the proliferation of electrified homes, automobiles, motion pictures, radios and phonographs.


The 1920s Dow was made up of the innovative companies that were leading the way, such as **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)), RCA and **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)).


It was the same in the 1990s and 2000s. The rise of personal computers, the Internet and smartphones transformed lives.


Today, the market is in a confirmed uptrend. It's very possible a correction could occur in the intermediate future. There's considerable optimism among investors, which is a contrarian indicator. The Nasdaq hasn't had a 20% correction since 2011. But the current Dow doesn't resemble 1929.

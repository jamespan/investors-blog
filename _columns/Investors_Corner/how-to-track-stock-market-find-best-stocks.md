Just seven trading days after the Nasdaq composite fell as much as 24% off its 52-week high on Dec. 24, at least one major stock index triggered a [bullish market shift](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/). And the [new stock market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) continues to show power.

A [Jan. 4 follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-stock-market-gains/) on the S&P 500 gave investors the green light to begin buying top stocks breaking out past a [proper entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Given the severity of the latest bear market, investors could be forgiven for being tentative.

Yet prepared investors who regularly read IBD Weekly and made smart buys based on the investing content found on Investors.com have been rewarded with solid returns over a relatively short time period.

Remain disciplined in the wake of a new trend change.

Right after a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/), investors don't necessarily have to go all in; [follow-through days can fail](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). If the market uptrend is real, there will be plenty of time to make money, as more and more stock leaders break out above a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

Even as a new uptrend gains more steam, [tracking the general stock market trend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) and following the top stocks are key in learning when to get into the stock market and when to get back on defense. At some point, every rally takes a rest.

## Top Stocks In The Stock Market Uptrend

Top chip stock **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) was one of the first stocks to kick off [earnings season](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-invest-when-to-buy-growth-stocks-earnings/) with a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) on Jan. 24. It  has now risen as much as 43% from a 95.28 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/).

Xilinx joined IBD's [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) premium service as a leading stock on the breakout day, Jan. 24.

A little over two months later, on Feb. 27, cybersecurity leader **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) staged a bullish move above a [potential buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) at 239.60.

[The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) extends up to 251.58. Therefore, shares remain in buy range.

While gains have been limited, the security software play has also built a new base on top of its large cup. This chart pattern, known as the [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), often leads to [strong breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and big gains when [stock market conditions](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) grow bullish.

How can you determine the stock market's condition right now? Read the [IBD Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). It highlights the daily market action. It tracks the number of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/) on the major stock indexes.

Distribution days show up when the stock index falls at least 0.2% or more on volume that is heavier than the previous trading day. These days — along with [stalling days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-a-stalling-day-provides-a-sign-of-distribution-on-up-day/) — represent extreme institutional selling.

Institutions are the primary drivers behind the stock market's trend. That never changes.

The Big Picture also highlights the leading stocks that are moving up and down in heavy volume.

## How To Find Top Growth Stocks To Watch

To quickly generate top stock ideas, check out the [Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/), [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/), [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).

[Stocks Near A Buy Zone](https://www.investors.com/category/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/) highlights a number of stocks each week that are in or near potential buy zones.

The stocks in Sector Leaders, IBD's most stringent and powerful stock screen, show powerful earnings growth along with strong relative price strength.

Consider **SS&C Technologies** ([SSNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSNC)). The financial software stock has recently surpassed [the 5% buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) after a breakout above a 61.07 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on Feb. 25.

The [Big Cap 20 stock list](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) focuses on large-cap growth stocks acting as strong as Dow Jones Industrial Average component and longtime market leader **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). Lately, the blue chip stock has sold off hard, giving back all the gains from a [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base with a 373.80 entry.

The surprise drop reinforces the validity of a [key IBD sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/): exit at least part of a position in a stock once the breakout produces a gain of 20%, 25% or more.

## Don't Ignore New IPO Stocks, Too

IPO Leaders highlights the stock market's up-and-coming stocks with special screening criteria for IPO stocks. For weeks, [recently-featured stock](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-analysis/ipo-stocks-to-watch-quantenna-communications-earnings-growth/) **Quantenna Communications** ([QTNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QTNA)) had been working on a new cup base that at first showed a 19.51 buy point. Then a two-week perfect handle developed.

The handle created a slightly lower entry point at 19.34, 10 cents above the handle's highest intraday price. On March 12, shares soared 9% in a strong breakout in five times average turnover. [The 5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/) in Quantenna went up to 20.31. Just weeks later, Quantenna gushed more than 17% higher on a plan to be acquired by **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) for \$24.50 a share.

For [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/) investors, the home page offers a slew of information, including stocks showing sharp moves up or down in big volume. The MarketSmith Growth 250 premium report offers stocks that are [breaking out today](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and stocks that are approaching buy points.

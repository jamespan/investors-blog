[The IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) has an enviable track record, up 18.4% so far in 2019 — going into Monday's session — compared with an 11.4% gain (excluding dividends) for the S&P 500.

To take advantage of that, it's not a matter of buying every stock on the list. Investors are best served when they choose the few best stocks in it. Besides, a portfolio of 50 stocks is too much for an individual investor to track simultaneously.

So here's a field guide, so to speak, to [the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) — some helpful ways to use its charts and analysis.

The screen basically looks for stocks with superior earnings and price performance. The exact details are not publicly disclosed, but suffice it to say they are among the best in the market.

## How To Use The IBD 50: Start With Chart Analysis

Don't assume that the components at the top of the list are necessarily better than the ones at the bottom. The best choices can be anywhere in the list.

As you scan each of the 50 stocks, start by reading the brief analysis at the bottom of each of the mini-charts (usually seen in pages B1, B3 and B4 in Monday's paper). IBD market writers strive to provide the most succinct yet cogent description of a stock's current state.

Is the stock [in buy range](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/nvidia-buy-range/)? Is it in trouble? Or, is the stock [forming a base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/)? Those few words will go a long way toward helping you decide whether to study the stock further.

Focus on leaders that are in buy range or still forming bases. The ones in buy range require immediate attention, because they quickly could become out of reach.

After you've gone through those, study the [IBD 50 members](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) that are still in base patterns. Be sure to note where the buy point is so you will know exactly when to make a purchase.

## When Market's Weak, The Field Can Be Weak

Because the IBD 50 scans for companies with superior fundamentals, there's less work for investors to do as far as researching all the financials. Still, checking the sales, margins and expected earnings can help you whittle down your choices. Keep in mind, when the market is weak, some lower-quality stocks can start showing up on the IBD 50.

You can use the [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) at Investors.com plus recent articles to better understand a company's situation.

Chart analysis is important, and you can view daily and weekly charts on Investors.com to get a better handle on that part of your research.

Don't forget to read Inside the IBD 50 (on Page B2 in Monday's paper) to get an overview of the current list. There are valuable insights on the top stocks.

## Key Terms To Know

Some key terms to know in the IBD 50 chart analyses:

**Extended:** The stock is above its buy range, and too far up to be considered for purchase. Investors who didn't buy shares while they were in range should wait until a new buy area emerges.

**Buy point:** The optimal price at which a stock should be bought. Investors can place a stop order at that price to avoid missing it. It's OK to buy shares as long as they are within 5% of the buy point, giving investors a period of at least a few days to make their investment.

**Sell signal:** Deterioration in the stock that no longer justifies owning it. Any stock that triggers such a signal should be sold, especially if it has fallen more than 8% from the buy point.

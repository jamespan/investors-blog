Let's say you buy a stock when it breaks out of its [base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) and clears its [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), but then it starts to pull back. What to do?

One option: Sell all or most of the position and protect gains.

Another strategy? Hang on to see if the stock can rebound quickly or form a [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/).

Like the name suggests, this pattern is simply a base that forms on top of a base. It usually occurs during a period of market turmoil, when even strong stocks come under pressure and consolidate rather than march higher.

For a [base-on-base pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/) to be viable, the new base must form before the stock has risen 20% above its [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from the initial base. It's OK for the upper structure to fall back to or below the lower pattern's buy point.

## When To Buy Growth Stocks: Watch For This Unique Chart Action

But if the upper part falls 7% to 8% below the first base's buy point, [sell shares to cut losses](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) if you bought at the first breakout. That's simply following the [golden rule of investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).

It's easy to view the stock as a failure because it consolidates so quickly after its breakout. But the structure often produces powerful breakouts once a new market uptrend begins.

"It's like a spring that is being held down by the pressure of a heavy object," [William J. O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), IBD founder and longtime former chair, wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "When the bearish phase in the overall market ends, as it always does, this stock is more apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain."

Treat the pattern as a single structure, not two separate bases. The second part of the pattern is critical. It should be a properly formed base with a well-defined buy point.

## When To Buy Growth Stocks: How The Base On Base Forms

![ICch-061416](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ICch-061416-300x167.jpg)

Ancestry.com cleared a 21.45 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) from a base on base on Sept. 20, 2010, in triple its average daily trade **(1)**.At the time, its Accumulation-Distribution Rating was a best-possible A+. Sales growth had accelerated for four straight quarters.

The second half of the base began forming in mid-August, when the market was in a correction. Notice how volume was light in the down weeks.

The stock began picking up in early September as a new market uptrend began. Ancestry.com more than doubled over the next seven months, hitting a peak of 45.79 on April 29, 2011.

## More Examples

In the past, **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) has made IBD's top stock lists including [Sector Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). Shares slowly rose out of a [long saucer with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-patience-is-required-to-play-the-saucer/) and a 84.50 buy point during the week ended April 7, 2017. By June, the cloud-based business software giant got only as high as 91.99, up less than 9%. Then it crawled sideways for seven weeks.

That action formed a tight, shallow, [flat base](http://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/). A clear breakout past a 92.09 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) ensured during the week ended Sept. 1, 2017. Since then, Salesforce has gained 58%.

**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) formed a base on base from March to September 2017.

In the second base, the stock dove deep into the belly of the first base. That's unusual but not surprising, given that in this case Micron's first base was nearly wafer-thin in its decline (from 29.87 to 26.37, a mere 12% correction).

Micron formed a [short handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) on its second base, an [11-week double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/), and ran past a 33.12 entry during the week ended Sept. 15, 2017. In March this year, the data-storage play hit as high as 63.42, up more than 90%.

Within the IBD 50, new base-on-base patterns are developing in **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) (currently a half-size position in [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard)), **Comcast** ([CMCSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMCSA)) (one of the largest companies trading on the Nasdaq), highflying REIT **Store Capital** ([STOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STOR)) and [new Leaderboard member](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)).

In June, Tempur Sealy cleared a [first-stage bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/) with a 68.52 [breakout point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). The gain of 19.5% to a recent new multiyear high of 81.85 came just shy of a 20% gain. So the recent sideways action constitutes the second part of an emerging base on base.

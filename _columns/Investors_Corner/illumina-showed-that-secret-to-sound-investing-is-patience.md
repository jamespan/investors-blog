Bad investing usually comes down to one word: impatience.

  

If a cash position during a market correction makes you so anxious you just have to jump back in to stocks, you might win here and there. But over time, you will lose because the trend has the odds on its side.

  

If waiting for an IPO to form a base seems like time wasted, you will learn the cost of short cuts.

  

If you rush into a stock when the company has yet to earn a dime because "it has a great story," then you should skip stocks and read novels. Fiction's unhappy endings are less painful.

  

Patience wins because it lets the market do the tough work of separating the dogs who can hunt from the dogs who can't hunt.

  

Patience waits for a market uptrend, a base and a breakout.

  

**Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) launched its initial public offering in July 2000. This wasn't the best time to debut. A bear market was under way.

  

The San Diego-based maker of genetic analysis tools beat the odds for a while. By late September 2000, the stock hit 51.63, up 32% from its IPO close.

  

The bear market, however, eventually proved too much. By March 2003, the stock had fallen to 1.71.

  

Smart money wouldn't have gotten caught in that buzz saw for two reasons. First, the 8% sell rule would've identified the exit long before the stock lost 97% of its value.

  

Second, Illumina had never turned an annual profit in the five years after incorporation. Smart money knew this puppy had yet to prove it could hunt.

  

The story changed in 2006. Illumina delivered an annual profit of 56 cents a share, the first of many.

  

Flash forward to 2010. With the market in correction, Illumina cleared back-to-back sloppy consolidations **1**. Then the Nasdaq delivered a follow-through day Sept. 1, confirming that an uptrend was under way.

  

Illumina had stayed profitable but struggled during the recession. EPS grew 50% in 2008 vs. the year-ago period but fell 14% in 2009.

  

In September 2010, however, earnings were on a turnaround path for a 32% annual gain.

  

On Sept. 16, 2010, Illumina cleared a 47.54 buy point in almost triple its daily volume **2**. The base was smoother than the previous consolidations. It rose 56% in less than five months **3**.

Imagine you buy a quality stock and it never gets much past the 5% buy zone. Day after day, the stock dances either near or within the buy zone.

At the same time, the stock doesn't trigger a sell rule, such as the 7% to 8% loss-cutting stop.

How much time should you give the stock? And which is the more likely next step — an advance toward a double-digit percentage gain, or a descent to the 7% loss?

So far this year, 20 quality stocks have cleared buy points in strong volume only to stall in or near the 5% buy zone. What happened next?

The results can be sorted into four tiers of varying success and failure.

**First tier**: Four of the 20 stocks eventually went on to rise 15% or more from the ideal buy point.

Driver-assistance software maker **Mobileye** ([MBLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MBLY)) spent about four weeks loitering in the buy zone after a February breakout past a 45.03 buy point. Even an earnings report that came in 10% above expectations didn't help Mobileye much. Finally, the stock gapped up in mid-March on news that **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) would buy Mobileye. The stock rose 37% from the original entry.

Ad tech firm **Criteo** ([CRTO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRTO)) spent almost seven weeks in the buy zone after a breakout past a 44.24 entry on Jan. 11. The breakout came in low volume, but heavy volume kicked in about 12 days after the initial clearing of the entry. (The stock price remained little changed during the 12 sessions, keeping a potential buy alive.)
Criteo fell about 3% on Feb. 22 despite trouncing the consensus on earnings. The next day it popped 5% and cleared the buy zone. The stock's gain eventually reached about 21%.

Mortgage insurance provider **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)) cleared a 34.04 flat-base buy point on Jan. 25. The stock seesawed above and below the buy zone. The gain eventually reached 16%.

After clearing a 53.03 entry in a lopsided base, midcap stock **Paycom Software** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) bobbed within and just above the buy zone for five weeks, then rose to a gain of 15%.

**Second tier**: Six stocks ended the post-breakout sideways action with moderate gains of 10% to 13%.

The six are **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), **CommScope** ([COMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COMM)), **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), **Dave & Buster's Entertainment** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), **Qorvo** ([QRVO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QRVO)) and **Tarena International** ([TEDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEDU)).

So the totals for stuck stocks that resolved the inaction with positive outcomes is 10 of 20.

**Third tier**: Three stocks neither rose much above the 5% buy zone nor triggered a sell rule: **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) and **Monolithic Power Systems** ([MPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPWR)). Their stories are still being sketched.

**Fourth tier**: The bottom tier is comprised of seven stocks — initially stuck in the buy zone — that eventually triggered the 7% to 8% sell rule. However, five of the seven showed gains of 7% to 9% before starting the slide to the sell rule. A disciplined investor could've sold the stocks for a small gain before they cycled into a loss.

Overall, the sideways action after the breakout has been worth enduring. Either the outcome was positive or savvy portfolio management could have helped the individual investor dodge the worst outcomes.

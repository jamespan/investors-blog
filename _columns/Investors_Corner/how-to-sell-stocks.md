When a stock hits a new high, it's human to respond to such news with joy.


Yet it's a different story when that same stock does not finish the trading session at or near that new high.


In fact, when a good stock makes a bad habit of reversing off its peak — as seen on a daily chart or a weekly one — it's time to calmly take action.


You may have spotted the right time to sell and bag your gains.


It's perfectly natural to first feel disappointed by the way that stock finished the day.


But then you might get hopeful.


You might think, "Well, OK, it got a little ahead of itself during the morning. I guess tomorrow morning it will go back and rally to another new high and make more money."


Be careful of letting other emotions — such as greed, disappointment and complacency — get in the way of a great sell. This is hard to do. After all, the stock has been a treat, like a gourmet-style ice cream and brownie sundae. So why not get the cherry on top?


Be conscious of your emotions and wary of your mind. If the stock refuses to go any higher and starts making bigger declines than normal, you have to act fast to lock in those precious profits.


**IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) was one of the Nifty Fifty stocks that blazed to huge gains during the go-go market years of the 1950s and 1960s.


Both decades shone of social and technological progress. America sent a man to the moon. The civil rights era bloomed. So did large-scale computing.


IBM seemed to move on a course to the moon as well. In the 1960s, the leader in large-scale computing gear made some big runs, including a breakout in November 1966 that sparked a 108% gain in just 19 months. That move followed a gigantic rally from 1952 to late 1961, when the stock rose 1,440%.


From August 1972 to early 1973, the stock molded another mild saucer base. It broke out past a 341.50 buy point (adjusted for a 5-for-4 split) on Jan. 15. IBM rose 7%, then sputtered.


Meanwhile, the stock market had topped soon after President Nixon's Nov. 7 re-election.


In the week ended Feb. 16, 1973, IBM reversed from a high of 365.20 to finish 1.1% lower in heavier weekly trade **(1)**.


The stock never saw that high again for decades. By September 1974, the stock had slid to 150.50, 59% off its peak.

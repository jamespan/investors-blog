  How To Trade: Deciphering The Cup With Handle

With a name like "cup with handle," you might think one of the best base patterns for high-growth stocks came from a housewares catalog.


But the chart pattern — which gives investors a strong buy point and has preceded many of the biggest stock runs in history — got its name from a simple shape, namely, the silhouette of a tea cup.


It consists of a U-shaped path — the cup — the stock price traces over its chart over several weeks. The stock's decline during the U-portion should be no more than 30% or 35%.


Before reaching new highs, the stock makes a secondary decline, usually no more than 8% to 12%. This serves as a final shakeout in the base that helps clear away the bears. The handle should slope lower across the price lows.


That's the basic outline of the base, but here are some key details investors should look for:


• The whole length of the base should be at least seven weeks. Some cup-with-handle bases can last a year or longer, though.


• The buy point is located by taking the highest price in the handle and adding 10 cents.


• Volume should be light as the handle forms. On the breakout, it should be at least 40% to 50% above average when shares rise past the proper buy point.


• Within the base, the price behavior should be calm, not having many wide price swings in the weekly or daily price bars.


Consider the cup with handle that formed in the chart of **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) in the summer of 2010. The stock had already made a substantial gain from an earlier breakout and consolidated gains from June through August of that year. (A strong prior uptrend also is an important element of a sound base.)


The 10-week pattern had the classic elements of a cup with handle: a moderate correction of 20% **1** and a handle that declined just 9% **2**.


Volume should be quiet at the base's low. In Chipotle's case it was heavy, but a shakeout that week served its purpose in firming up the pattern.


Other elements of the base were bullish. There wasn't a single down week in above-average volume, while two up weeks came in above-normal trade. That's evidence that institutional investors are accumulating shares. Many weeks, the stock closed high in the price range.


Chipotle broke out in strong volume 3. Shares soared 70% from its buy point until it began a new base in December.

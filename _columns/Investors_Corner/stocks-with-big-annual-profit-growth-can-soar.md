The biggest stock market winners of the past century typically showed strong profit growth for at least three years before beginning their big advances, according to IBD research.


Annual earnings growth is so important that it has its own letter -- "A" -- in IBD's [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) investing system acronym.


To find the stocks with the potential for the greatest price gains, look for companies with annual profit growth of at least 25% over three to five years. Such companies typically boast new products or services that take market share or create new markets, as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) did with its iPhones, Mac computers and iPads.

“It’s the combination of strong earnings in the last several quarters plus a record of solid growth in the recent years that creates a superb stock, or at least one with a higher probability of success during an uptrending general market,” IBD founder William O’Neil wrote in “How to Make Money in Stocks.”


Annual earnings-per-share figures can be found in minicharts throughout IBD, including the IBD 50 and Stock Spotlight. The data can also be found in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) at Investors.com.


Lately, few companies have been able to post robust EPS growth because of the sluggish economy. As a result, many slower-growing defensive stocks had replaced growth stocks in the IBD 50 earlier this year. They include real estate investment trusts such as **CoreSite Realty** ([COR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COR)) and big cap stocks like **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), which tend to perform better in slow-growth environments.


But pockets of strong growth remain. A select number of IBD 50 stocks with strong annual earnings growth are listed in the accompanying table. They include **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), which enjoys three- and five-year earnings and sales growth rates of more than 50%.


Of course, not all stocks that meet the A in CAN SLIM will turn into winners. It's also important to consider criteria such as sales growth, return on equity, and profit margins before buying a stock. And in all cases, investors should wait for each stock to form a proper base and clear its buy point in strong volume before buying.


Strong profit growth that's accompanied by weak sales growth could be a sign that a company is cutting costs to boost profits. Or, if sales growth exceeds profit growth and margins are shrinking, it may mean the company’s costs are too high or its products are facing tough competition.

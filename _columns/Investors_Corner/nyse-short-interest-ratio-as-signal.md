  Extreme Readings In Stock Indicators Raise Flags

In the stock market, extreme readings on a secondary indicator are worthy of attention.


Whether they're good or bad, abnormal readings often provide more useful information than normal readings do.


On most days, an investor can glance at the NYSE short interest ratio (today on Page B12) and then turn the page.


The NYSE short interest ratio measures the total number of shares sold short, divided by the NYSE's average daily volume. A ratio of 5 means it would take five days of average volume to cover all the short positions within that exchange. Nasdaq stocks are not included.


So a big number means there is more bearish sentiment. Contrarians believe that a high level of bearishness is bullish for stocks and a low level is bearish for stocks.


However, it doesn't always work out that way, which is why it's called a secondary indicator.


The most recent extreme reading, though, appears to be working as a contrarian indicator. In the Sept. 17 issue of IBD, the ratio hit a five-year high of 4.77. This should've led to bullish action and it did. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 have risen as much as 10% and 7%, respectively, since the Sept. 16 close. The ratio has since dropped to as low as 4.11 in mid-November and was at 4.45 as of the Dec. 17 IBD.


Yet simple as this sounds, using it as a timing indicator can get complicated. A five-year high or low often leads to additional five-year readings as the gauge moves to the extreme. Only in hindsight do we know the peak or low.


So what good is the indicator? Think of it this way: Glancing at the sky doesn't make anybody a weatherman, but if you see a large, growing funnel cloud, you don't need a degree in meteorology to draw a conclusion.


Sometimes a low in short interest can signal trouble ahead. When bears are scarce and bulls are common, where will new money to drive stocks higher come from?


In March 2000, the NYSE short interest ratio fell to an eight-year low of 3.40. This occurred near the peak of the bull market. The Nasdaq eventually dropped 78% off its March 2000 high, while the S&P 500 began a 50% decline.


The number in 2000 should not be compared to current numbers. In late May this year, IBD switched from a short interest ratio calculated from volume traded only on the NYSE exchange on Wall Street to NYSE trades made on all exchanges.

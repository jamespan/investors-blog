For some investors, investing is a one-and-out game.

Win or lose, they are always moving on to a new thing. The idea that a stock can be bought back after it fails — often at a higher price — is never considered. The idea that a stock can be bought back — at a higher price — after the investor reaped profits from a breakout is also off the table.

But pulling buckets of profits from the same well is possible.

In November 2005, **Cbeyond** ([CBEY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CBEY)) debuted on the Nasdaq. The provider of IT and communications services formed a four-week IPO base and broke out **1**. But the stock had a lowly Composite Rating of 37. Five sessions later, the stock triggered the 8% sell rule **2**.

By March 2006, Cbeyond formed a cup-without-handle base **3**. The Composite Rating was 71. Some investors will ease their standards for an IPO. For many investors, a 71 rating probably wouldn't have been good enough.

Still, Cbeyond broke out **4** in mid-March. By month's end, the Composite Rating was 90 — a thumbs-up level for many investors. The stock, however, was extended.

The first opportunity to buy shares was when the stock returned to and found support at the 10-week line **5**. The stock rose as much as 35% from that entry area but then corrected. An investor could've sold on a weak rebound or a negative reversal and locked in a gain of 10% to 25%, depending on how quickly he or she reacted.

Anyone who missed the sell signals would've been chased out by the 8% sell rule when Cbeyond formed a second-stage base **6**.

The new base was oddly shaped. But the gap-up within the base (not visible on the weekly chart) was bullish. Cbeyond broke out Sept. 12, 2006, in triple its usual volume, clearing the 24.62 buy point **7**.

From there, the stock could've been played several ways. An investor could've locked in a 20% to 25% gain in four to six weeks. Or the investor could've held the position and added shares on the first bounce off the 10-week line **8**.

Holders would likely have been chased out of the position when the stock formed the bearish railroad tracks pattern **9**. An investor who played Cbeyond more than once could've had a cumulative gain of more than 50%.

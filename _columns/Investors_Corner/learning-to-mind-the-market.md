Early in this 2016 presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has proved he's not too shy to argue with those who buy their ink by the barrel.

  

But arguing with the market — particularly for those who don't have Trump's billions in financial assets — is a different ball of wax.

  

This column sounds the cautionary notes that accompany the M in [CAN SLIM trading rules](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749&nav=IBDUCourse2).

  

The M stands for Market. It means paying close attention to the general direction of the overall market, to how institutional investors are behaving, and to the economic climate influencing stocks.

  

The most simple and straightforward way to mind the market is to read IBD's daily [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) and monitor the Market Pulse feature. The Big Picture strips away hype and the tendency in the broader news media to cover stories that are exciting but not really moving the market. The column instead strives for objective analysis on the day's trading. It also highlights signals of strength and weakness that the market has sent.

  

Market Pulse, a table published alongside the Big Picture, gives quick vital signs on the day's action. It also provides an invaluable one-line take on the market status: Confirmed Uptrend, Uptrend Under Pressure, or Correction.

  

Why is such a simplistic tool important? A sense of equilibrium is often hard to come by for investors. Every big drop on the market feels like the beginning of a bear market; every energetic rally feels like the bull is roaring out of the gate.

  

But factors such as volume, key price areas of support and resistance for the major indexes (namely the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500), institutional behavior and seasonal influences are a few pieces of market science that even seasoned investors sometimes fail to take into account.

  

The Big Picture considers a broad array of supplemental gauges of market behavior: the Bulls vs. Bears Survey (today on page B11), the puts vs. calls volume ratio (B2), and the CBOE Volatility Index (B11). IBD gathers all of these factors into a carefully considered read on what the market says to investors each day.

  

The idea is not to attempt to project long-term market behavior, but to answer this question: "What is the best course of action for me, as an individual investor, when the market opens tomorrow morning?"

  

Keep a special eye out for market factors affecting investors in the best growth stocks. This means reading the charts of stocks found in the [IBD 50](http://leaderboard.investors.com/ibd50/fulllist/), [Big Cap 20](http://news.investors.com/investing/inside-big-cap-20.htm) and [Your Weekly Review](http://news.investors.com/investing/your-weekly-review.htm) lists to determine whether the market is moving with or against that class of stocks. The columns that accompany these features offer guidance on tending portfolios, a crucial aspect of how investors respond to a shifting or uncertain market in order to remain in the game, while maintaining a specific level of exposure to risk.

  

The ultimate goal is to replace emotional, seat-of-the-pants investing with an educated, informed approach to day-to-day investing and portfolio management. The result, if managed persistently over time, is less risk, smaller losses during bad times, and bigger gains as more capital gets concentrated in winning stocks in good times.

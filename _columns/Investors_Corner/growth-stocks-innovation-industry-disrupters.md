In the stock market, big profits can be made if you know how to identify an industry disrupter in the early stages of its business. An industry disrupter is a company that comes to market with a new product or service that "disrupts" an existing market.

In a 1995 essay titled "Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave," Harvard professors Clayton M. Christensen, regarded as one of the world's top experts on innovation and growth, and Joseph L. Bower wrote about how **IBM** ([IBM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBM)) dominated the mainframe computer market in its early years but got left in the dust when Digital Equipment Corp. unveiled its minicomputers.

DEC, in turn, mostly missed out on the personal computer market where **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and other firms became dominant.

Industry disrupters aren't exactly a dime a dozen, but examples aren't hard to find.

It didn't take long for **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) to disrupt the retailing industry. For years, Amazon spent heavily to build out its infrastructure. The investment is finally making its way to the bottom line as booming online sales continue to pose a big problem for large brick-and-mortar retailers.

**Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) arguably is an industry disrupter but not because of its cars. Carmakers aren't suffering because of Tesla's luxury electric vehicles. Many have lower-priced offerings of their own. The potential disruption lies in the battery business: With its \$5 billion car battery gigafactory plant in Nevada, Tesla's goal is to reduce cell costs faster and produce more lithium-ion batteries by 2020 than were produced worldwide in 2013.

And let's not forget about **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), whose online streaming service is causing more and more consumers to "cut the cord" with cable TV operators.

A lot of money has already been made in all three names, but the good news is that more will hit the market in coming months and years.

The IPO market is always a hotbed for industry disrupters. Read the [IPO Analysis](http://news.investors.com/investing/ipo-analysis.htm) column in Tuesday and Thursday's IBD to find potential stock ideas.

While industry disrupters are always innovators, innovators aren't always industry disrupters. It's an important distinction. When automobiles were first introduced in America, they were expensive luxury items that did not immediately disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles.

But when the lower-priced Ford Model T came to market in the early 1900s, the car turned into a disrupter.

Many top-rated companies in IBD's database are innovating with new products or services, but most fall short of "industry disrupter" status. That's not a bad thing, though, because many stocks with high Composite, Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength ratings have new products or services that are fueling big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Those are catalysts for big price gains.

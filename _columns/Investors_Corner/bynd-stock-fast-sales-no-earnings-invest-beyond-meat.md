Individual investors sometimes get excited about a new thing that isn't truly new. The thing would be immediately recognized as old, if only the investor had 40 or 50 years of trading to draw on.




**Beyond Meat** ([BYND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BYND)) debuted on the stock market in May with no shortage of attention. The stock priced its initial public offering on the Nasdaq at \$25 a share. It soared as much as 207% past its 65.75 May 2 opening-day close. The stunning run only needed 33 days.


What's not to like? How about almost everything?


If IBD investing were purely momentum investing, there would be no reason to pass on stocks such as Beyond Meat. Price performance has been dazzling. But there are problems that the skeptical investor must acknowledge.

CLOSE




Beyond Meat's quarterly report after the July 29 close points to some difficulties. The company's adjusted loss of 16 cents a share missed views by 100%.


Beyond Meat also announced a secondary offering of 3.25 million shares. Beyond Meat plans to use the net proceeds to increase production, marketing and working capital.


The stock dropped 9% Tuesday in vigorous afternoon trade. Earlier in the day, it slumped as much as 17%.


Other problems loom.


BYND Stock: More Problems To Face
---------------------------------



First, Beyond Meat offers plant-based patties, which for a concept stock isn't new. Others that can make a similar claim are Gardenburger (now owned by **Kellogg** ([K](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=K))), Boca Burgers (part of **Kraft Heinz** ([KHC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KHC))) and Morningstar Farms (Kellogg). A more recent competitor is privately held Impossible Foods.


Second, Beyond Meat lost money each year in 2016-18 and the Street expects another loss in 2019. Currently, analysts see the company swinging to a net profit of 8 cents a share in 2020.


Revenue growth has been brisk, up 101% and 170% in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Can a company rely on fast sales growth without the imprimatur of strong earnings?


For a while, perhaps.


Zoe's Kitchen, for example, grew revenue 46% to 59% in 2009-2013. But the stock never found a consistent profit groove, and eventually was bought by Cava Group in August 2018. Cava picked up Zoe's for \$12.75 a share, almost 50% below its opening day IPO close of 24.72.


IBD Founder On New IPO Stocks: The Key Word Is 'Sustainable'
------------------------------------------------------------


"There's absolutely no good reason for a stock to go anywhere in a big, sustainable way if its current earnings are poor," William J. O'Neil observed in "How to Make Money in Stocks."


The keyword in that quote is "sustainable."


Beyond Meat has provided a wild ride for investors. The stock suffered negative reversals in 13 of its first 33 sessions.


Competition in the plant-based, meatlike space is fierce. Although the veggie burger has found a niche market, growing beyond that is a challenge for three reasons.


BYND Stock And 3 Reasons For Caution
------------------------------------


First, many vegetarians don't need or want the look of meat. (That's what they're trying to escape.) Second, many restaurants have their own original recipes for meatless patties, and the taste is often superior to the frozen patties. Beyond Meat supplies both fresh and frozen patties made from peas and mung beans.


Third, stock market history has been hard on the meatless patties. That's why most have been bought and tucked into a bigger company. Many were too small budget to pay for the choice shelf placement in a major supermarket chain.


Consider Gardenburger, a stock that debuted in June 1992. The stock climbed 84% in nine sessions and then began a long slide. More trouble followed.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wIC070119-300x226.jpg)As the accompanying chart shows, the stock tried to make a big run in 1998 and hit new highs. But Gardenburger staged a nasty reversal, falling hard for the week in huge turnover **(1)**. Classic sell signal for those who invest in growth stocks.


Eventually, the Nasdaq delisted the company in March 2001.


The company filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, and Kellogg bought the company in November 2007.


Outside the veggie niche, other initial public offerings in the past two years have dished the same recipe: strong revenue, no profit. How have they done?


Choppy Action
-------------


Among companies that launched their IPO within the past two years or so, 19 featured fast revenue growth and no earnings. Most have suffered choppy action, some after a strong start, others not even that.


China-based **Pinduoduo** ([PDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PDD)) has been choppy despite revenue growth of 266% in 2017 and 631% in 2018. The company lost money both years. The stock is currently forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), but trades more than 30% below a 52-week peak of 31.99.


Ride sharing firm **Lyft** ([LYFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYFT)) was a one-day wonder, rising from an IPO price of 72 to 88.60 on Day 1, a level it has not seen since. Lyft grew revenue 209% and 103% in 2017-18 but failed to turn a profit.


Others, such as marijuana-tied stock **Cronos Group** ([CRON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRON)), have a more disciplined look on the chart. Cronos built two consolidations, then ran up 63%. The stock has dropped and is now trading 44% off its high.


Beyond BYND Stock: The ETF Alternative
--------------------------------------


A better way to play these wild stocks might be an exchange traded fund. Renaissance IPO ETF ([IPO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPO)) is up 41% year to date. Last year, though, the ETF lost 17.5%.

The most important rule a successful investor must follow is to cut losses. Only in that way can you prevent one loss from becoming a disaster from which it is difficult to recover.

It's a rule many beginning investors have trouble following because they just can't bring themselves to lock in a loss. They hope the stock will come back, but often that's not how it works. The stock's slide continues. So you must cut your losses. Never mind how much conviction you have in the company.

No investor is going to make winning trades 100% of the time, just as no basketball player is going to make every shot. Be selective, play the percentages and get out quickly when the trade doesn't work.

IBD Chairman William O'Neil teaches that losses should be cut at a maximum 7% to 8%. His studies showed that when a stock falls 7%-8% after rising past the proper buy point, it usually fails to recover.

The power of cutting losses can be seen in the percentages. An investor can lose 7% twice, make a 20% profit once and still be ahead of the game.

Treat each stock loss as a bite to your total portfolio's health. The smaller the bites, the better off you'll be. Generally speaking, if the loss on a stock does not take more than 1% of your portfolio's total equity, you're cutting losses properly.

Let's see how this can work in practice. Imagine you have a \$500,000 portfolio and you plan to divide it among 10 stocks. Each holding will be worth \$50,000.

So, there's a follow-through day, and you buy one stock that day. Over the next few weeks, the rally continues, and you find more good growth stocks breaking out and add positions until you are fully invested.

Let's say you chose poorly on four stocks and sold each of them for a 7% loss. You sold each holding for \$46,500, a \$3,500 loss on each stock for a total loss of \$14,000. Each loss represented less than 1% of your total starting equity.

On four of your other positions, you held for a number of weeks, selling them on the way up. You sold two for a 20% gain and two others for 30% profits. The 20% gainers were sold for \$60,000 each, netting \$20,000. You cashed in the two 30% gainers for a total gain of \$30,000. You've booked a total of \$50,000 in profits, which pretty much salves the wound from the \$14,000 loss. Total profit: \$36,000.

But wait â€” You have two more long positions. Turns out those two stocks rocketed out of proper bases and gained more than 20% in their first three weeks.

You elect to hold them because they are likely big winners. Months later, you sold one for a 70% gain, up \$35,000. The other went into a climax run, and you sold it for a 100% gain (\$50,000 profit). The gain on your six profitable positions reached \$135,000. Subtract out \$14,000 in losses for a total profit of \$121,000, up 24.2%.

This simulated trading routine doesn't pick up one other advantage of cutting your losses: When a breakout fails, it usually does so within the first two or three weeks of a breakout.

That gives you cash that you can put to work, either in another stock that could be a winner or to add at strategic points on those two winners on the way up.

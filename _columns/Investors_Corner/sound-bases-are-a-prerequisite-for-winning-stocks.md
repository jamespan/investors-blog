Cup bases on a stock chart should not only form over at least six weeks and look like a cup. They should also be smooth in shape, rounded and symmetrical.


The left side of the pattern should show only limited selling, and any high-volume declines should end with the stock closing in the upper 60% of its trading range, a sign of support.


It's all in the charts. IBD research on market winners — going back as far as the 1880s — shows that stocks forming correctly shaped bases have the best chance of success. Few of the big market winners broke out of a lopsided base, an overly deep base or a V-shaped pattern.


Charts also help you spot the proper buy point for stocks meeting CAN SLIM criteria, as IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil explained in "How to Make Money in Stocks": "You want a stock to prove its strength to you before you invest in it."


**Ascend Communications** ([ASND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASND)) shaped a six-week cup starting in October 1994. Normally, counting begins at the first down week from the left-side high of the base. In Ascend's case, the buy point was 17.85, or 10 cents above the base's left-side high.


The left side of Ascend's base shows two straight down weeks in which the stock closed near its lows. Also, the stock swung more than 10% from high to low during those weeks. Too many weeks like that in the base are a flaw. You'd prefer to see tight trading, which indicates that the institutions aren't eager to sell.


Volume was tame and volatility eased at the bottom of the base as the stock got support at around 28 and began climbing. And the daily chart, which is normally more volatile, in this case shows much tighter trading.


Furthermore, the modem manufacturer's base was only 21% deep from high to low, well within the 30%-to-33% limit for a cup base.


Overall, the number of up weeks in the base outnumbered down weeks. The cup pattern itself looked smooth and symmetrical because the stock's descent and climb were orderly.


In the week ended Dec. 16, the stock shot past the 35.60 buy point, soaring 21% for the week. Volume was 54% above its 10-week average; a heavy spike is good to see on a breakout.


In addition to a base's shape, other technical as well as fundamental characteristics are important. At the time of its breakout, Ascend's Relative Strength line was bolting to new highs, a sign of strength. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was an A, indicating strong demand for the shares.


Also, the stock had an EPS Rating of 78, a little below what you'd like to see but not a deal-breaker.


Ascend ran up its sharply rising 10-week line to a high of 71.25 (adjusted for three 2-for-1 splits) on May 20, 1996, good for a gain of 1,500%. Lucent Technologies bought the firm in 1999, which later merged with Alcatel to become French telecom gear giant **Alcatel-Lucent** ([ALU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALU)).

  Are Women Better At Investing Than Men? Seriously? What Matters More Than Sex

In January 2005, Larry Summers made a comment about women during a speech that was a gross generalization. It was also grossly erroneous.

Now, we are talking about a highly accomplished individual. Summers served as U.S. Treasury Secretary during the Bill Clinton presidential years. He became an economics professor at age 28 and has written 150 scholarly papers. He advised President Obama on what to do about the biggest banks and the auto industry during the Wall Street subprime debt meltdown of 2008.

However, Summers' comment at a National Bureau of Economic Research luncheon -- that innate differences between men and women may explain the relatively low number of women scholars in the physical sciences -- raised a lot of hoopla in academic circles and at Harvard University, where at the time Summers was serving as president. The [Harvard Crimson](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/1/14/summers-comments-on-women-and-science/) reported that MIT biologist Nancy Hopkins "felt physically ill" after hearing Summers' remarks.

Some believe the controversy ultimately cost Summers his job.

What does this anecdote have to do with the art and science of stock investing?

If you want to be a great stock picker and an equally great stock seller, then it matters practically zilch whether you are a man or woman. The market is blind to your sex.

What factors matter far more? They include your knowledge about the market and the companies in which you invest; your level of discipline in following sound rules; your strength of conviction when it matters most; and your ability to control your emotions. Being male or female does not give you an advantage or disadvantage in any of these factors.

Such a statement may seem a minority view.

Go on your computer, iPad or smartphone and type in, "Are women investors better than men?" Google will list a stream of stories that argue such a case. In December last year, AARP's website began one article in this way: "Overall, women are better investors than men."

The reason? The writer cited research from professors at the University of California-Berkeley who concluded, after a study of stock trading patterns between the sexes, that men trade 45% more than women. The scholars argued that since frequent trading eats away at returns, women thus performed a full percentage point better than men.

Excuse me?

No one will perfectly pick the next **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) (up 1,835% from its Oct. 20, 1981, breakout to a peak in September 1983), **Wal-Mart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) (giant market winner from the late 1970s to 1990s), **L Brands** ([LB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LB)) (formerly The Limited, one of the biggest stock market winners in the women's apparel industry), **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) or **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) in every single trade.

In a field of 10,000 stocks trading each day, the mathematical odds are simply too low.

Good trading is certainly an act of research and preparation before you buy any security. But the search for great stocks also carries a big element of trial and error.

Speaking of errors, do you think the founder and chairman of Investor's Business Daily, William O'Neil, ever made bum stock trades? Of course. Not every stock O'Neil touched turned into gold. But O'Neil's greatness in the stock market came not only in the ability to find and clarify the elements of great stocks at the start of their huge price runs (what [CAN SLIM](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) is all about). As associates who have worked closely with O'Neil will tell you, he also succeeded by quickly recognizing his errors of market judgment and keeping losses in many stocks very small.

Over the years, women have made strides in the field of equity research and portfolio management. You can read about their adventures on Wall Street via books such as "Tiger Woman on Wall Street" by Junheng Li. Meredith Whitney became famous for making a bearish call on **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) in late 2007, saying the big bank will be forced to suspend its dividend (she was right). Whitney later left Oppenheimer as a research analyst and started a hedge fund. But in 2015, she was forced to close Kenbelle Capital LP due to poor results and an exit by its largest investor, according to a June 11, 2015, Wall Street Journal article.

To be fair, innumerable men have had far more spectacular failures as fund managers. John Meriwether's Long-Term Capital Management, which included two Nobel Prize winners, blew up big time in the fall of 1998. The point: Being a woman doesn't provide you immunity from a stock market that is going the opposite direction of what you think or feel. Everyone must respect the market.

"I will never give myself the luxury of thinking: I've made it," Zaha Hadid, the designer of the aquatics center at the 2012 London Olympics and other grand projects who died in March in Miami, once said. Although the star Iraqi-American architect wasn't likely talking about stock investing, such an attitude is valuable in the market.

The stock market doesn't know who you are. It cannot know whether you're male or female. Nor will it ever care.

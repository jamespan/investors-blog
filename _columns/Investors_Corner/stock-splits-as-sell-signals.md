You've racked up a 30% to 40% gain or more in a promising stock. It looks as though it has the potential to run higher, but you don't want to overstay your welcome. And other leaders near buy points are calling your name.


One caution sign that could affect your decision: too many stock splits.


Companies with high share prices often conduct splits to lure more investors. In a 2-for-1 split, for example, an investor who owns one share of a stock at \$100 gets two shares worth \$50 each. Stock splits can be done in virtually any ratio: 2-to-1 to 10-to-1 or more.


Technically, more investors can now afford shares of the stock. This gives the company a wider audience and the potential to raise more money.


Sell into such excessive optimism.


While single stock splits aren't necessarily a problem, too many stock splits create a flood of supply. If the company has in fact overestimated demand, the oversupply can eventually weigh on share prices. This is especially true for stocks that turn in long, sharp advances near the tail end of a bull market or early in a bear market.


IBD research has found stocks often reach a price top around a company's second or third stock split within the span of just a year and a half. For CAN SLIM-style investors, an announced stock split is sufficient cause to give your stock a good, hard look and review your exit strategy.


IBD research has also found that 82% of the stock market's biggest winners generally did not split shares in the year preceding their most significant price advances.


Titanium Metals cleared a cup base in the week ended July 30, 2004. The stock pulled back soon after, but popped again to new highs in late August after the company announced a 5-for-1 stock split. Shares more than tripled by early September 2005.


Over the next eight months, Titanium rose another 440%. It also announced three 2-for-1 splits â€” the last being its fourth split in less than two years. The stock topped soon after the stock's fourth split. It fell 51% in less than two months.


Here's another example: **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)) in February of 2000.


Investors who had bought the star Web search engine as it cleared a cup-with-handle base in June 1997 saw gains of nearly 8,000% by January 2000.


They also saw the company announce three 2-for-1 stock splits in the 18 months from August 1998 to February 2000. The third split came during a pullback.


The stock broke out in November 1999, spiking another 159% by January. Shares pulled back and began building a base.


The final 2-for-1 stock split hit in February 2000. By the end of March, a wide-and-loose base failed to finish **(1)**. The stock, following the general market sell-off, shed 97% by late 2001.

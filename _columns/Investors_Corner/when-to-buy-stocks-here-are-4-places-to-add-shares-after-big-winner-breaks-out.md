When you buy a [CAN SLIM-grade stock](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/) on the breakout, clearing a [well-researched buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/), then watch it rise fast and sharp, it just feels the best. So, what could be the next best feeling?




Try this: Put a little extra money in the same stock when it rallies from a post-breakout [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). IBD calls this a follow-on entry.


Decades of IBD research in the biggest market winners show there are at least four separate opportunities to add more shares as a great stock's big run unfolds.


The first follow-on buy may emerge when a stock pulls back and surrenders some of those gains. It falls to or just below the 10-week moving average on a [weekly chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY), or to the 50-day moving average on a [daily chart](https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nasdaq-nasdaq-composite-0ndqc.htm?cht=pvc&type=DAILY). If the stock falls to the 10-week line or mildly below it, wait for the stock to rise back above the line. That can give you a new buy area.

CLOSE




Demand heavy volume as the stock rebounds. Or, check to see if turnover increases during the week of that new rally vs. the prior week. This follow-on buy point should exceed the price of a breakout from a key pattern including the [base on base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/charts-101-how-the-base-on-base-etches-superb-stock-gains/), [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/), [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/) and [double bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/).


When To Buy Stocks: Follow-On Buy Point No. 1
---------------------------------------------


In the week ended July 26, **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) busted out of a four-month [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 195.10 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). Volume surged 61% that week vs. the prior week and well above its 10-week moving average.

Spot that bulge in activity by comparing the volume bar with the 10-week moving average line drawn on all IBD weekly charts.


Strong breakout by Edwards? Absolutely. In four weeks, the expert in devices to repair damaged heart valves rallied 13% from the breakout price of 195.10. At the July 24 breakout, IBD's [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) noted the market in a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/). But the market got rocky in August as the U.S.-China tariff spat grew ugly.


Edwards fell 3% during the week ended Sept. 13. Volume increased that week, hinting at a real shakeout taking place **(1)**. But the 10-week line provided support.


One could have bought a small bunch of shares near 213, or when the stock rebounded off the line near 219.73 just a few weeks later **(2)**.


One suggestion: Don't buy more than a quarter of the amount you invested at the [initial breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


Here's Another Follow-On Chance
-------------------------------


Two additional follow-on buy points can emerge when a stock builds a [three-weeks-tight or four-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-3-weeks-tight-pattern-gives-you-an-extra-buy-point/). In this pattern, eye consecutive weekly price changes of no more than 1.5% from the prior week. Ideally, the price range of each week proves narrow. Volume should dry up. Add 10 cents to the pattern's highest price to find the breakout point.


Edwards etched the three-weeks-tight twice, first in September and again in early October **(3)**. It marked ultra tight weekly closes on Oct. 4 (at 229.4), Oct. 11 (227.11) and Oct. 18 (227.46). They hinted that institutions did not want to give up their shares. EW sparked a new buy point of 230.39, a dime above the highest price in those three weeks.


Consider buying no more than one-tenth or one-eighth of your initial position.


2 More Add-On Opportunities
---------------------------



After a significant run-up, expect a stock to take a rest. The ensuing price correction may establish a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). If the market uptrend remains healthy, then you can buy more shares on the fresh breakout. The [short stroke](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) — when a stock trades in a super-tight range one week after a gargantuan breakout week — offers a rare fourth follow-on buy. The short-stroke week should be like a tiny pen stroke on paper or the screen. Expect to see thin volume. Also, that week's price high should not exceed the prior week's peak.


The action in **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) lately appears like a short stroke.

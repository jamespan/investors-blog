Recently, this column has been devoted to explaining the ins and outs of follow-through days.


Indeed, they have a great track record of flagging new uptrends — whether the follow-through occurred on Sept. 1, 1990, Oct. 15, 1998, or March 17, 2003.


Not all follow-through signals are foolproof, but they're always important to recognize. They put the odds in your favor for making money.


But some follow-through days aren't as straightforward as others. The ones that occur after a 15% to 20% pullback in the market generally tend to work better than those that occur after a short-term pullback in a bull market.


That's because a 15% to 20% pullback gets a lot of sellers out of the market. The fewer sellers there are, the easier it is for a follow-through to gain traction.


Some follow-through days that occur in the later stages of a bull market can be choppy, hesitant and begrudging.


These three adjectives aren't friendly terms for growth investors trying to make money in stocks. Choppy action means choppy returns at best. Erratic market action after a follow-through day means that sellers are still abundant.


Growth investors with a successful track record always take cues from the general market when deciding whether to be aggressive with new buys or not.


They know that the chances for profitable trades are better when a follow-through is seen after a good shakeout for the market. A 5% to 10% pullback for the market sometimes isn't enough to wipe the slate clean of sellers.


As noted in an [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/707021-follow-through-signals-can-go-bad.htm) column last week, a new rally is more likely to fail if a distribution day occurs in the first few days of a follow-through. Even if it doesn't fail, trading is likely to be erratic, to the point where taking modest gains and cutting losses sooner than normal is good strategy.


Follow these simple rules when major averages are showing wishy-washy action after a follow-through:


• If your new buys aren't making progress after a follow-through, don't look for additional buys. Throwing good money after bad is a common pitfall for many investors.


• Take profits at 10% to 15% instead of waiting for the typical 20% profit target. A profit can evaporate quickly when distribution days start to increase in frequency.


• Cut losses at 3% to 5% instead of waiting for the usual 7% to 8% sell rule to trigger.


• Avoid buying stocks breaking out of late-stage bases. If a follow-through day occurs after a short-term pullback inside a bull market, it's unlikely that the selling was intense enough to reset base counts. Late-stage bases form after a stock has already made a big move after a few successful breakouts.


The market's latest follow-through day occurred on May 27, when the Nasdaq rose 1.2% in higher volume. It came several weeks into the rally attempt — on the late side — but it resulted in a good advance.


No one knows how the long the current rally will last, but keep in mind that the follow-through came after a 10% pullback for the Nasdaq. The follow-through also occurred more than five years into a bull market that started in March 2009. Some would argue that the current bull market is getting long in the tooth.

When a stock breaks out of a [proper base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/), big volume signals serious institutional buying.

What if a stock crosses the [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/), but in only average or below-average trade volume? Does that still count as a [valid breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/)? It depends. In a general market uptrend, a [breakout in heavy volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) increases the chance of a bigger advance, while one in light volume may lack the power to follow through.

Ideally, turnover will run at least 40% higher than usual [at the breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). Small and midcap leaders may break out in volume that's double or triple its 50-day average turnover or more.

"During major breakouts, it's not uncommon for new market leaders to show volume spikes 200%, 500% or 1,000% greater than the average daily volume," IBD founder and longtime Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks." "In almost all cases, it's professional institutional buying that causes the big, above-average volume increases in the better-priced, better-quality growth-oriented stocks at pivot breakouts," he said.

Yet keep an open mind toward the rare instances where a leading stock will stage a low-volume breakout; then a flood of buyers will pile in a day or even a week later. In some cases, the breakout starts late in the trading session. Or, the market is awaiting important news in the coming days or weeks.

## How To Trade Growth Stocks: A Top Case Study From China

**Alibaba Group** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) cleared an 85.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) base on Aug. 9, 2016, in volume that grew only 4% higher than normal **(1)**. Investors who shrugged at the lack of enthusiasm that day likely took notice the next session, when shares gapped up and rose 2.5%; volume kicked in at more than twice usual trade **(2)**.

![IC_baba_100716](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IC_baba_100716-1024x577.png)The Chinese online retail giant followed that up with a 5% gap up on Aug. 11; volume swelled 301% above average **(3)**. At this point, shares were already extended, running more than 5% past the proper entry.

Alibaba then went for four in a row with a 7% jump in even heavier trade, 413% higher than usual. All told, the stock rallied 15% in the three sessions following the initial, light-volume breakout.

Shares soared as much as 29% from the breakout to its Sept. 28 intraday high, triggering the [20%-25% profit-taking rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-handle-stock-market-expectations/) along the way.

Most stocks will pause to digest their gains after advancing that much.

## A New Medical Software Leader Among Growth Stocks

Alibaba isn't the only one that initially cleared a sound base in light trade.

On May 18, 2016, **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) cleared a 28.05 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in turnover 26% below average. Volume stepped up a few days later, but it wasn't until seven sessions following [the breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) that a big spike occurred. The stock vaulted 8% in volume that was more than 700% higher than normal.

The impetus? A solid fiscal Q1 earnings beat. The cloud-based software firm serves the global life sciences industry in critical business functions, including regulatory compliance.

By Aug. 31, less than four months after the [solid breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/), the stock soared 52%. Today, shares trade near 144, up more than 400% past the original [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 28.05.

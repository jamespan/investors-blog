A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?



The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.


Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.


If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.


Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.


In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.


Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.


The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.


Some people sneer at "fad stocks." They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.


Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.


For example, egg producer and distributor **Cal-Maine Foods** ([CALM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CALM)) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.


In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.


For instance, **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.


From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.


How might the 85-85 be used?


Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.


An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)), **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)) and **Skyworks** ([SWKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWKS)). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.


Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: **Landstar System** ([LSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSTR)), **Old Dominion Freight Line** ([ODFL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ODFL)), **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) and **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.


Turnarounds and fads were scarce.


The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

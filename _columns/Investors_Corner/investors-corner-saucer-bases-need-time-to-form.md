Patience is a virtue.

  

This can be particularly true when tracking a long-term subtle pattern like a saucer base.

  

A saucer base typically features a 12% to 20% correction: essentially a shallow cup. The major difference is that, while the pattern can form in as few as seven weeks, it commonly takes several months or more than a year to bear fruit.

  

When it does, particularly when a bullish saucer forms during a strong market, it can presage a powerful advance.

  

Because saucers often appear as only slight depressions in stock value, they can sneak up on you. Be sure to use weekly and monthly charts to spot this pattern as it forms. A daily chart often won't give you a full view.

  

A good example was medical software systems maker **Cerner** ([CERN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CERN)) when it tried, then failed, to clear a cup-with-high-handle base in early March 2004 **1**. Those who bought at the breakout faced a quick loss and should have sold to cut losses at 7% to 8% **2**.

  

But investors who kept an eye on the issue over the next several weeks noticed how it corrected 19%, then found support at its 40-week moving average **3**.

  

By July, the 10- and 40-week averages had converged, cradling the stock in a holding pattern straight through November **4**.

  

To some investors, the result may have looked like a doddering chart pattern: no gain for eight months.

  

But those who looked closely would have suspected Cerner was building a saucer base.

  

While deeper corrections shake investors out, saucer bases wear them down. Those who hold on are the stalwarts who understand and have faith in the company's fundamental strengths.

  

The long consolidation can also depress certain technical gauges, such as the Relative Price Strength Rating. RS ratings often sag lower during long saucer bases. Cerner's RS was a soft 59 at the time of its breakout.

  

Saucers require most of the same characteristics as cup-type bases. Accumulation weeks should outnumber distribution weeks. If the stock also shapes a handle, it should drift lower in soft trade. Breakouts should occur in volume that is 40% or more above the 50-day average. Cerner cleared its 48.80 buy point on a 128% surge in volume on Nov. 15, 2004 **5**. Shares climbed more than 100% over the next 12 months.

In the stock market, focusing on high-quality names going up in price is generally better strategy than targeting the weak price performers, which in many cases are being sold because of deteriorating fundamentals.


So what's the best way to identify the market's strongest price performers?


IBD's [Relative Price Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) (RS Rating) is your ticket. It ranks stocks on a scale of 1 to 99, with 99 being the best. A stock with an RS Rating of 99 means it has outperformed 99% of the stocks in IBD's database based on 12-month price performance.


The general rule of thumb is to target stocks with RS Ratings of 80 or higher. It's not a steadfast rule, but it's generally a good pond to fish in when looking for strong-performing growth stocks.


Stock screens like the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/ibd-50-performance/), [Sector Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders), [Stock Spotlight](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/stock-spotlight/) and [IPO Leaders](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) are loaded with strong price performers with several other compelling traits as well.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IC100317.png)When it comes to slower-moving, large-cap stocks, it's OK to be a little more lenient with the RS Rating. Dow component **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), for example, has been moving sideways since late January, hurting its recent RS Rating of 66. But big buyers have been in the stock lately, though, as the chip giant is in the early stages of breaking out of a flat base with a 38.55 entry.


Homebuilders have been showing high relative strength for some time now. Just recently, the group was up about 63% year-to-date, compared to a 13% gain for the S&P 500. No surprise, then, to see multiple names in the group with high RS Ratings. Leaders in the group like **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) and **Pulte Group** ([PHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PHM)) recently boasted RS Ratings of 88 and 86, respectively.


Meanwhile, airline stocks have been lagging the market. Year-to-date, the group is down 12% year-to-date. Bright spots in the group include Brazil-based **Gol Intelligent** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) and **SkyWest** ([SKYW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKYW)). Both have high RS Ratings but are extended past proper buy points. More widely known names in the group, such as **Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) and **JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)), have been showing middling price performance at best, with recent RS Ratings of 20 and 19, respectively.


**Barracuda Networks** ([CUDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CUDA))  offers another example of how sideways and lagging price action can hurt the RS Rating, which is now at 57. Barracuda has doesn't much since hitting a high of 26.69 about a year ago. Shares were recently trading around 24.39.


But using the RS Rating isn't as easy as buying all the 99-rated stocks, thinking they're slam dunks for outperformance in coming months. Sometimes, that is the case, especially when a high RS stock is building a base and poised for a breakout.



But stocks with high RS Ratings can also be well extended past proper buy points and too late to buy. In the accompanying table, **YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) continues to show outstanding price strength, but it's extended from an 83.10 buy point. **Fiat Chrysler** ([FCAU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCAU)) also owns an outstanding RS Rating. The carmaker is trading tightly near highs after a breakout over an 11.75 buy point. [Tight weekly closes](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/additional-buy-points/) after a breakout often yield additional entry points.


Buying an extended stock is an easy way to lose money quickly in the stock market. The trick is to find stocks with high RS Ratings that haven taking a breather and moving sideways after a nice run. Those that correct the least tend to hang on to strong RS Ratings.

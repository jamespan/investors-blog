If fund managers are getting out of the stock market and a correction is imminent, how can individual investors spot this ominous trend?


The answer, in a word, is distribution.


That's the name on Wall Street for heavier-than-usual selling of stocks. When distribution is expanding at a fast pace, it's a solid sign that the biggest investors are shifting out of stocks into other types of investments, or cash.


Fund managers are usually silent about those big decisions, and in public they may even be talking up stocks. But any investor can detect distribution by studying a price-and-volume chart of the major indexes.


Specifically, distribution occurs when the Nasdaq or S&P 500 falls significantly in higher volume than the prior session.


Yes, it's that simple.


Of course, an occasional decline in higher volume can happen even during the strongest markets.


The tricky part is knowing how many distribution days represent a real danger to the market.


From studying market cycles over many decades, we can conclude that usually five to six clear-cut distribution days over a five-week period is the critical level. If that happens, usually a market top is in the works.


Distribution days can occur even as the major indexes are still climbing to new highs.


Also, there's an insidious form of distribution known as stalling. That's when a main index makes little price progress in higher volume. Often, the index closes low in its daily price range as buyers walk away from the market in the final hours.


The precise characteristics of stalling-type distribution are too complex to discuss here. IBD's Market School full-day [workshop](https://www.investors.com/products/how-to-make-money-in-stocks-workshop-series/market-school/?src=ibdevnt/) explains all of the finer points that define stalling.


IBD's [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) explains when distribution of any form has occurred, and when instances of distribution have reached the level when it's smart to take profits and avoid stocks.


IBD tracks distribution days methodically in Market Pulse, which runs with The Big Picture each day (today on Page B2).


In some cases, heavy distribution does not result in a market peak. Usually, that's when the leading stocks hold up well amid broad selling, which can be taken as a sign that savvy institutions haven't totally bailed out on stocks.

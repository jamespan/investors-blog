You know how to pick a good stock, but you can't understand why you're not racking up the big gains. What gives? If you've ruled out other factors such as a correction in the [overall market](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) or simply buying the stock at the wrong time, the answer could come down to a character trait: impatience.

  

Impatience can lead an investor to miss out on big potential gains by selling a stock prematurely or hopping to others with less desirable fundamentals.

  

Not every stock is going to be a double, triple or home run — especially in short order. So while it may test your nerves to hold a stock for a few weeks or months, it can pay off over the long run if you've got a true market leader.

  

IBD recommends taking at least some profits in stocks that have appreciated 20% to 25%. That way, you can be sure to lock in some gains to help offset losses in others.

  

And while a 20% or 30% gain might sound like small potatoes to some investors, profits can add up if you have several outperformers in succession.

  

What about a stock that runs up far and fast, and you think it might have more legs? That's where the eight-week hold rule kicks in. During a sound market uptrend, if a leader rallies 20% or more in the first two to three weeks of a breakout, you should hold it for eight weeks, then re-evaluate it when the term expires. This plan helps keep investors from making a hasty decision and exiting a stock prematurely.

  

**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) broke out past a 56 cup-with-handle buy point in the week ending March 22, 2013. It advanced 18% over the next two months before pausing to form a short cup with handle **(1)**.

  

Though the stock didn't reach the 20% to 25% profit-taking level, some traders may have found it too slow and sold it. But in early August, Nike cleared the new 64.76 buy point and ran up 24% in four months **(2)**.

  

A third new base formed in early 2014 but failed to produce a strong run. Then in late August, Nike smashed through upside resistance near 80 and rose 24% to new highs — again, over a period of just four months.

  

Investors who hung in from the 56 initial buy point enjoyed a 78% gain over 21 months **(3)**.

  

Big-cap stocks tend to move slower than their smaller counterparts, so they can take longer to generate gains. Even so, Nike proved much swifter than the Dow Jones industrial average. From March 22, 2013 to the end of December 2014, the Dow advanced 25%.

Are you a savvy equities portfolio manager?

That is, do you practice sound techniques and follow good rules to boost wealth and outperform the market itself?

Investor's Business Daily presents readers with a set of [proven buy rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/) and [smart sell rules](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/) that allow readers to act in a timely fashion amid the 24/7 flow of financial news. Follow [the rules of CAN SLIM](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/can-slim/), IBD's seven-point paradigm for finding top stocks, and you'll learn to [buy stocks at a proper breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).

Good rules also help you capture gains on the upside and minimize drawdowns. How? By [selling losers quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) and [taking gains on the way up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) before the market shows a major top.

Buy and sell rules, however, are just two facets of the practice of smart portfolio management.

One of the biggest investing debates is how much, or how little, should one invest in any one particular stock.

Financial planners, market pundits and the media often advise to diversify their stock portfolios to minimize risk. But IBD research shows that it's actually less risky and more rewarding to own just several carefully chosen stocks and to monitor them carefully.

## How Many Growth Stocks To Own: Focus, Focus, Focus

"The best results are achieved through concentration, by putting your eggs in a few baskets that you know well and watching them very carefully," IBD founder William J. O'Neil wrote in "How To Make Money In Stocks."

"The winning investor's objective should be to have one or two big winners rather than dozens of very small profits," O'Neil added. Diversification is "plainly and simply often a hedge for ignorance."

Diversification may temporarily lower risk by reducing exposure to any one stock. But a portfolio of 20 or 40 names can be unwieldy. It can lead to confusion and weak returns. And what if you enter a full blown bear market, which begins after a flurry of [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-do-you-spot-a-major-market-top-easy-look-for-heavy-distribution/), and just sit, thinking that some of your stocks will be fine?

That strategy proved disastrous during the 2008-09 Wall Street debacle. No industry group within the market was spared. Even the Dow Jones utility average fell more than 48%. The correlation risk among all sectors in the equity market was too high to ignore.

## A \$20,000 — \$200,000 Portfolio Should Hold This Many Growth Stocks

People with \$20,000 to \$200,000 to invest should limit their holdings to four or five stocks. Those with \$5,000 to \$20,000 should consider buying at most three stocks, and those with around \$3,000 should limit their holdings to two stocks, O'Neil writes.  Larger accounts could hold eight to 10 stocks, possibly a few more.

Form a watchlist focused on industry-leading companies with top-notch fundamentals. Next, [make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) and that the chosen stocks are clearing a [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after forming [a sound base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-base-stock-charts/). [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) and the [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), found in the Research section of Investors.com, help you quickly research current market conditions and individual stocks.

The research doesn't end after buying a stock. Keep an eye on the fundamentals. Watch for character-changing action in the price-and-volume action on a chart. Tough to do with a big portfolio.

Stocks that have broken out tend to offer [secondary buy points](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) that allow investors to add shares. If you concentrate more money into such winners, you are in effect giving the portfolio a chance to compound gains in your very best decisions. Give your portfolio the fuel to power a big total return.

In other cases, further research may reveal a new stock that looks poised for a strong run. As a result, it may be best to sell a lagging stock and move the cash into a better-performing stock within the portfolio.

## A Look Back At The Stock Market In 2012 To 2013

In 2012, the S&P 500 gained as much as 13% from Jan. 1 through a high on April 2. The accompanying table of stocks that broke out after the Dec. 20 market follow-through shows how it's possible to beat the market.

Priceline Group, now **Booking Holdings** ([BKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKNG)), InvenSense and others were able to enrich an investor's portfolio faster. Booking surpassed a 549.10 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) and rose to 774.96, up 41%. When it cut through its 50-day moving average near 680 on May 10 the same year, an investor could sell and still reap a 24% profit.

**Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) went on to become a big winner on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), breaking out again in January 2013 en route to big gains the next two years.

Big winners on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) in 2019 include **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and aerospace play **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)).

Big cap and industrial sector stock TransDigm joined the [Leaders List of Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) on Jan. 29 just as it cleared a four-month base with a 375.50 [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) (before a 106-for-100 stock split related to a special one-time cash dividend of \$28 per share to shareholders) in heavy volume on strong Q4 results. The stock has climbed more than 51%.

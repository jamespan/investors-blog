The double-bottom base is a pattern that's often easily missed or misidentified. If you don't recognize the double bottom for what it is, you may find yourself waiting for a cup to develop after a stock has already broken out.

  

In this, the second of a series in must-know chart patterns, we will scrutinize one of the basic formations. The double-bottom base will appear frequently, but not as often as a cup with handle.

  

So what is a double-bottom base? It's just what it sounds like, a base with two bottoms.

  

Taken together, the whole pattern should look like a big "W." The second bottom should be at least slightly lower than the first.

  

True, some double bottoms can show a higher second bottom, but that's usually a flaw. The whole purpose of that second bottom is to shake out the stocks' weakest hands. This sets the stage for a powerful breakout later.

  

Like a cup with handle, the double bottom requires at least seven weeks to take shape. The correction within this pattern should be no more than 30% or 35%, depending on how the broad-market averages are doing.

  

Also like the cup with handle, tighter is better. You could get some loose, wide-swinging action as the second bottom appears. This may signal that investors who had been taking a position in that stock are fed up waiting for something good to happen. In fact, that's what you're counting on.

  

The buy point comes in at the apex sitting between the two bottoms. That is, of course, unless a handle forms. That's possible, too. As with any base, demand a breakout to show a volume surge of at least 40% above average.

  

Let's look at **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), a former technology sector superstar. In July 1990, just five months after coming public, Cisco started to build what would turn out to be a three-month double-bottom base **1**. The first bottom appeared Aug. 23 at 22. The stock rallied to 27 over the next month, and then dipped as low as 19.75 on Oct. 10.

  

The buy point was 27.10, a dime above the apex between the two bottoms **2**. The Nasdaq followed through Oct. 18. A day later, Cisco triggered its buy point with heavy volume. It was the start of one of the market's biggest-ever runs.

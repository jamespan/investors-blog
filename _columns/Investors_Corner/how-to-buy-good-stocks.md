For a growth investor, it's always great to see a leading stock "act right" after a breakout. A potential leader can hold gains and show tight, sideways action. This is a sign of strength and can often lead to more gains.

Or the stock can come down to its [10-week moving average](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735785&sourceid=735786) in light volume and bounce off the key support level in heavy volume. Both are common occurrences and can lead to more gains, particularly in the early stages of a new market uptrend.

**A Fresh Buy Point**

On a weekly chart, the 10-week line is a place where institutions will often add to a position. Individual investors with conviction in the stock can do the same or even initiate a new position.

A stock's first or second pullback to the line is a viable entry, but after that, investors should avoid additional buys. Also, try to buy as close as possible to the 10-week line, not way above it.

After a lengthy bull market, buying off the 10-week line gets trickier. This is particularly true today, where [distribution](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735764) , or higher-volume declines in the major averages, has resulted in increased volatility and back-and-forth action.

Bounces off the 10-week line have the best chance of working when new money is coming in from the sidelines, not amid signs of [institutional selling](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735782&sourceid=735786).

IBD often refers to the 10-week line, particularly in mini weekly charts in sections like the IBD 50, IBD Sector Leaders and [IPO Leaders](http://news.investors.com/iponews.htm). In IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/leaderboard) product, charts of buy ideas are annotated to show when 10-week support emerges.

**Avago Technologies** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) cleared a 39.84 buy point from a first-stage base in September 2013. The market tide was flowing positive at the time, making it easier for the breakout to work. The stock paid a visit to its 10-week line in mid-November. After briefly piercing the line, the stock rallied 0.6% in above-average trade in the week that ended Nov. 15 **(1)**.

Avago closed near its weekly high in solid volume. An add-on buy or even a first-time buy worked nicely. Avago eventually completed a flat base and broke out in early December over 47.31.

The fabless semiconductor industry leader rallied nearly 39% before forming a second-stage base around its 10-week line in April 2014 **(2)**.

If you're an investor looking for actionable breakout stocks, you first need to locate certain patterns of psychological behavior. IBD calls them [bases](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). Bases provide a technical price area of support and give the stock a point of reference to break out from.




The saucer-with-handle base is one of [eight very important patterns](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) that IBD investors look for in potential [breakout stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


By carefully monitoring price and volume action, investors can learn to master these common bullish patterns, thereby improving their returns.


Breakout Stocks: How To Spot A Saucer-With-Handle Base
------------------------------------------------------


Saucers are unique because they often take up to a year or two to mature. That's much longer than the other base types. The saucer's shallow and wide characteristics mean that the base-formation process is long and gradual. Rather than scare you out with unexpected action, they tend to wear you out.


The saucer with handle looks similar to a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) except the base stretches over a longer period of time. The depth of the base can still be greater than 33%. But when stretched over a period of years, the decline from the highest price to lowest within the base may appear mild.


Not all saucers require a [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/). If a handle doesn't form, you can use the saucer's left-side high as your [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). If a handle does form, add 10 cents to the highest price to find your [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Bases with handles tend to have a higher probability of success. The handle provides a downward price drift, or shakeout, to knock out any weak holders. Be sure the handle forms above the stock's [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/).


Saucer-With-Handle Base In Amazon Stock
---------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ICamzn021720-300x161.jpg)Among notable breakout stocks, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) formed a saucer-with-handle base that began building back in July of 2019, according to the [MarketSmith chart analysis tool](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith). MarketSmith's pattern recognition helps investors spot these bullish patterns.


Amazon's saucer completed formation in January of 2020. Then, Amazon stock proceeded to form a tight handle above the 10-week line **(1)**. The right side peak of the handle, 1917.82, on Jan. 9 of 2020, plus 10 cents shows you a proper buy point of 1,917.92 for Amazon stock. On Jan. 31, Amazon made a [breakaway earnings gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) on better-than-expected earnings and rose nearly 9% by day's end.


On a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/), one could use the high in the first five minutes of trading as an alternate buy point — or at 2,051.47 — and buy as close as possible to that entry.


The saucer base often comes with weaker [ratings profile](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) than a stock with a faster-developing base. For example, the [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of a saucer-based stock might be lower than you'd expect.

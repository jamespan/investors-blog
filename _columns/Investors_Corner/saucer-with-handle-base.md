Cups and saucers go together not just on the dinner table but also in the market. Cups-with-handles are the staples of big market winners, the most common [stock chart pattern](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735786&nav=IBDUCourse5) found before a winning stock takes off for a profitable advance.

  

Investor psychology is the reason bases are built. Since human psychology never changes, the patterns are eternal. As a previously advancing stock declines, weak hands become fearful and sell. But institutional investors who have conviction about the company's strength are buying on the way down and as the base is taking shape on the right side.

  

The [handle](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/742803-tight-areas-in-bases-show-accumulation.htm) is a necessary shakeout that forces out the last of the weak holders. The light volume in the handle reflects the fact they are just about gone.

  

The saucer-with-handle is much like a cup-with-handle except it's often more shallow in appearance, even if it still corrects no more than 12% to 30%. They can take longer to form, up to a year. They look like a saucer rather than a cup.

  

Investors tend to spot them on more thinly traded stocks or the shares of companies that are slow but steady growers. Don't automatically pass over them. Some can be held for many months, advancing while never undercutting their 50-day lines.

  

An example of a saucer-with-cup is **TJX Cos.** ([TJX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TJX)), the operator of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores.

  

TJX was repeating a familiar retail theme of finding a successful model for a store, then repeating it across the country and the globe. In 2011, TJX introduced Marshalls in Canada, and continued to expand its T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods concepts. In 2012, it opened its 1,000th store. In 2013, it moved into e-commerce.

  

The company reported quarter after quarter of steady earnings growth. Revenue increases were limited to the high single digits, but also reliable.

  

TJX set up in a 10-month saucer-with-handle base during 2010 and early 2011. It corrected just 18% over that time. The 11-week handle **(1)** corrected 10%, well within normal bounds of no more than 8% to 12% correction for a handle.

  

The stock might have been easy for even an experienced CAN SLIM investor to miss. It had a IBD Composite Rating of just 77. The EPS Rating was a more impressive 89, but the Relative Price Strength Rating was a mediocre 50. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating was C.

  

The stock broke out past a 23.66 buy point. On Jan. 25, 2011, volume surged 64% above average. After pulling back to the buy point for a few days, the stock began a long advance, tracking on the north side of its 10-week moving average.

  

Beginning in the summer of 2011, a nasty market correction brought TJX briefly below the key support line. But once clear of the correction, it continued to advance until September 2012, when it began building a new saucer with handle.

  

Throughout the advance, it tested the 10-week line continuously, yet found buying support. In a stock like TJX, it's best to stick with it during a healthy market uptrend, even when it briefly drops below the support line and you have a solid profit cushion. The stock might go further than you would have ever guessed.

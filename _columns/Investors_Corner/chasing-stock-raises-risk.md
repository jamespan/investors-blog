If a leading stock on your watch list takes off and jets well past the buy point before you have a chance to react, be patient.

Just as you don't want to buy a stock prematurely, you shouldn't chase it too far up in price, either. Chasing a stock increases risk — there will be little cushion to buffer a downturn.

Instead, look for the proper buy point, whether from a base or on a rebound off the 50-day or 10-week moving average.

IBD considers a stock to be in buy range if it's within 5% of the proper entry. Beyond that, it's considered extended, and investors should wait until the next buying opportunity comes up.

There is one exception, however, to the 5% buy range — the break-away gap. On rare occasions, a big winner will gap up at the open, surge past the buy point and make an intraday low that's well above both the ideal entry and the prior session's high.

If a breakaway gap occurs, that's a sign of unusual strength, and investors can generally consider buying beyond the normal 5% buy range.

"If you buy at more than 5% to 10% past the precise buy point, you are buying late and will more than likely get caught in the next price correction," IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in "How to Make Money in Stocks."

If that turns out to be the case, pay close attention to make sure the stock doesn't trigger the 8% loss-cutting rule. The rule kicks in if a stock falls 8% below your purchase price. If this occurs, sell the stock — no questions asked.

Take **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), for example. When the electric car maker went public in June 2010, it had not yet turned an annual profit. So when it finally did, in 2013, the stock went on a tear.

Shares broke out from a long consolidation in April that year.

Tesla surged more than 380% from the breakout to the start of a second-stage cup base in early October 2013.

The 40% correction from the left side to the bottom was steeper than most proper bases, but the stock showed accumulation as it built the right side of the pattern.

It formed a narrow handle (best viewed on a daily chart) for a buy point of 186.10, which it cleared in early February in modest trade.

From there, the stock pulled back as it shaped another cup with handle, this time with a 33% correction and a 244.59 buy point.

Tesla broke out past the entry the week ended Aug. 8 in above-average volume. The maximum entry point of the 5% buy zone was at 256.82 **(1)**.

Tesla didn't move as fast this time. It rose as much as 19% from the entry over the next four weeks (or 13% from the top of the buy range) before turning south.

Investors who missed the buy zone and chased the stock further up would have seen a smaller gain get quickly whittled away as Tesla slipped below its 10-week moving average.

In late September, it triggered a sell signal by giving up a 15% gain from the 244.59 buy point **(2)**.

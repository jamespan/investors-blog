*Sixth in a series*

  

Among IBD's 20 rules for investment success, only one is the golden rule: Always cut your losses short. Always.

  

If you're new to growth-stock investing, then you'll understand the value of this rule by the end of this column. If you've been investing with IBD for a while, you know its importance. You've seen big leaders that peaked, then fall drastically. You know the golden rule keeps your portfolio safe in good markets and bad.

  

Why cut losses at 7% to 8%? Why not 10%, 15% or 3% to 4%?

  

IBD's research has found that if you buy a leadership-quality stock at the moment it breaks out of a sound base, and the market is in a healthy uptrend, the stock should not fall 8% from the proper buy point.

  

It could briefly fall a smaller percentage. In this case, you stay put. Only sell and cut your loss if it hits the 7% or 8% trigger. You can sell quickly if you realize the stock isn't a true leader or if the market is going downhill fast.

  

Cutting losses is like having disaster insurance. By shielding your nest egg from devastating trades, you earn the privilege to invest again.

  

What if pride, ego or indecision prevents you from selling when a stock is down more than 8%? Consider the math. To offset an 8% loss in a stock, you need an 8.7% gain in the next one. No sweat.

  

But what if you decide to dump a stock that's fallen 25%? You'll need a 33% winner to break even. How about a 50% loser? Your next stock must double to yank yourself out of the hole. Chilling math, isn't it?

  

Nicolas Darvas described the personal terror he experienced in 1955 after buying shares of Jones & Laughlin on margin in "How I Made \$2,000,000 in the Stock Market." Hours of research convinced Darvas, a professional dancer, that "nothing could go wrong."

  

Things went wrong.

  

"I saw it fall and yet I refused to face reality. I was paralyzed," he wrote. Darvas had projected the stock rising to at least 75. It never did. Instead, it went from 52.25 to 44 before he sold and took a loss worth the value of property he owned in Las Vegas. From that point on, he followed price action like a hawk and acted accordingly.

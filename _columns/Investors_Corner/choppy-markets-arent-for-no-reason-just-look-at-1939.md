The stock market of 1939 was a textbook case for choppy markets.


Draw a line on the Dow Jones industrial average chart from the start of the year to the end, and the early January high served as a cap for most of the year. Under that cap, the Dow chopped up and down for about nine months, then settled into sideways action the rest of the year. In 1939, the Dow lost 2.8%.


What can an investor learn from 1939’s market? Choppy markets don’t emerge from a vacuum.

In 1939, the stock market had plenty of reasons to be uncertain.


**The economy**: Despite President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s efforts, the economy remained in the doldrums. The unemployment rate in 1939 was either 17.3% or 11.3%; the difference is whether statisticians counted work relief jobs as employment or not. Net effect for market: negative.


**Income taxes**: The marginal income tax rate was 78% for the richest in 1939 and 4% for the poorest. (By comparison, the rates under Calvin Coolidge, the U.S. president in the 1920s, were 25% and 1.5%.) Net effect: negative.


**Capital gains tax**: The rate was 30% in 1938-39, which was a reduction from 1936’s 39% rate. (Under Coolidge, the capital gains tax was 12.5%.) Net effect: better but negative.


Economic news wasn’t the whole story. Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany was the wild card. On Jan. 27, 1939, FDR approved the sale of war planes to France. The Dow rose 1.8% in quiet volume but still fell hard for the week **(1)**. On March 15, Nazi Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. The Dow fell 2.3% in heavy volume and 5.5% for the week **(2)**.


March 22: Hitler tells Lithuania to give Memel to Germany. Lithuania hands it over. The Dow fell 2.7% in heavy volume and 14% in the next three weeks **(3)**.


May 22: Germany and Italy sign a pact. Dow gains 1.6% **(4)**.


Aug. 23: Germany and Soviet Union sign a non-aggression pact, which clears the way for Hitler to invade Poland. The Dow falls 2.4% in moderate volume amid a four-week slide **(5)**.


Sept. 1: Germany invades Poland, which starts World War II. The Dow falls 5% intraday but reverses to a 0.6% gain. Over the next two weeks, the Dow adds 16.7% **(6)**.


Some investors conjectured that the U.S. could remain untouched, profiting off war materials. But that delusion would unwind in late 1941.

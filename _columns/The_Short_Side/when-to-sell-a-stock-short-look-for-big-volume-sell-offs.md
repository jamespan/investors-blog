  When To Sell A Stock Short? Look For Big-Volume Sell-Offs

To excel in the art of short selling, you need to use stock charts. That triggers another question: What do you look for in a chart? As this [monthly column has noted earlier this year, IBD research has discovered two critical price patterns that give you good odds of making money on the short side: the head and shoulders](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/052915-754890-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) and the late-stage base.


As you search for these two patterns, keep an eye out for big sell-offs in heavy volume, preferably on the weekly chart.


Scott O'Neil, president of [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com), an IBD sister firm, came up with the term "torpedo" to describe those occasions when a former market leader gets hit with a sharp weekly decline — generally in the range of 5% to 10% or more — in volume that soars above the 10-week average.


A battleship that suffers too many large holes caused by enemy torpedoes is going to sink. The same fate will happen to a stock when fund managers engage in a barrage of heavy selling.


The torpedo sell-offs may occur while a short sale pattern forms, or soon after a short-sale entry is triggered.


Such negative price-and-volume action may lead to an additional entry point for the enterprising trader.


**BlackBerry** ([BBRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBRY)), formerly known as Research in Motion, was once the top company in smartphone devices. Comedians and celebrities joked that the email-enabled Blackberry device was so addictive that it was nicknamed "Crackberry."


In June 2006, BlackBerry broke out of a long cup with handle at 84.58 (before a 3-for-1 stock split in August 2007) and vaulted 304% by November 2007. In the three years through fiscal 2007 (ended in February), EPS jumped 331%, 18% and 33%. Revenue soared 127%, 53% and 47%.


In June 2008, the stock cleared a faulty third-stage base, then reversed hard in the week ended June 27. The stock presented a late-stage short sale signal as it crossed the 10-week moving average 1 and fell 8% below a faulty base-on-base pattern at 144.60.


That week turned out to be a great torpedo sell-off week. It was down 16% in the heaviest weekly volume 2 on a down week in months.


Other clues of heavy institutional selling include the weeks ended Nov. 9, Nov. 16, Dec. 7, and Jan. 11, 2008 3, as the faulty middle-stage base formed, ahead of the last rush to new highs.


The decline abated, and BlackBerry rebounded. For a short while the stock held above the 10-week line, which was now slanting lower.


The action from early April to late August 2008 set up a head-and-shoulders-like pattern over five months, the typical length of time for this short sale pattern.


Traders got a fresh short entry when BlackBerry crossed back below the 10-week line near 119.78 in the week ended Sept. 5, 2008, just as the market correction gained steam.


Always cover at least part of your short position when the gain reaches 20% to 25%. Those with iron-clad conviction could hold out longer. But don't let greed cause you to allow the stock to rebound and squeeze all of your profits.


Today, BlackBerry trades just under 8, 95% below its 2008 peak.

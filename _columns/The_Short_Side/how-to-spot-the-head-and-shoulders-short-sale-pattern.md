There are at least three keys to a smart search of a stock to short. The first key? Look only at stocks that rise at least 300% to 400% in price to new highs. The second key: Count the number of bases. The more bases, the more likelihood that a good short-sale entry will emerge. (See the April 6 [Short Side column](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm).)


The third key: Become sensitive to leading stocks as they show days of falling sharply in above-average volume. The Stocks On The Move table, today on Page B7, can help.


Use all three keys to sharpen your ability to identify the head-and-shoulders topping pattern.


It can be tough at first to spot this pattern. After all, a leading stock is generally rising and striking new highs in price. However, seasoned investors know that that it's a series of big drops, often in heavy volume, that helps to shape the head and shoulders.


When a stock forms a base and breaks out to all-time highs, it doesn't guarantee success for investors who bought at the proper buy point. The stock may rise a few points, then reverse lower and dive into the price area in which the base formed.


Such action produces the left shoulder and the head of the head-and-shoulders pattern.


Use IBD's top research screens — from the IBD 50 to Your Weekly Review — to make a watch list of stocks that break out, then wobble. Keep a close eye on The Big Picture column and the current outlook displayed in the daily Market Pulse table.


Are you seeing multiple flawed cup patterns forming? Is heavy distribution piling up among the major stock averages? Is the current outlook flipping rapidly from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure" or from the latter to "market in correction"?


If all of these elements are in place, the market soil is likely fertile with short-sale candidates.


Study the daily and weekly charts of a stock. As a stock falls from its highs, the price declines should be large, and volume should swell. Watch if the stock rallies back to the 50-day moving average (10-week line on a weekly chart), then slips back below it. If it happens two or three times, a right shoulder may form.


The right shoulder often trades in a lower price area than the left shoulder. That pattern tells you that sell-minded institutions are growing.


After the right shoulder has formed, the time to sell short is when the stock falls through the 10-week line in heavy volume. Short as close as possible to that support level, and be sure to cut losses at 7% to 8% if the stock rebounds and shows strength.


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) rallied from a low of 15.25 in 1963 to a peak of 91 in the week ended April 15, 1966. But Boeing nose-dived 11% the next week, the worst decline in years. Volume surged 1. That shaped the head of the pattern.


The aircraft and satellite maker dived 33% in a matter of weeks. A rebound back above the 10-week line raised hopes for the bulls. But the stock had trouble holding above the key support line.


By July, a five-month head-and-shoulders pattern was complete. Notice how the 10-week line was now bending lower. A short sale near 71 yielded a fine profit. Boeing fell to 57 just five weeks later. The profit topped 25% — time to cover.

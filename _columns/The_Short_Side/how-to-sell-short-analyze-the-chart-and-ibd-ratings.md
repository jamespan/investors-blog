If you want to sell a stock short, asking this question is logical:


What are the stock's IBD ratings like when it's time to short?


One short answer: It depends.


A second short answer: In the case of short selling, most of the ratings matter less. The overall chart action matters a lot more.


IBD research has found that two basic stock chart patterns offer the best short-selling opportunities: the head-and-shoulders [pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/010314-685052-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) and the breakout from a [late-stage base](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/053014-702808-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) gone sour.


These patterns differ in many ways, so one can expect some of the IBD ratings to diverge as well.


**The Pattern Matters**


First, let's consider the head-and-shoulders pattern.


One would be right to expect the Relative Price Strength Rating to be weak. After all, in this pattern, the stock first makes a big drop from its highs, completing the head. Then it usually tries to make at least three rallies back above the 10-week moving average, but the moves sputter.


The company's fundamentals may still be strong. The EPS and SMR ratings will likely remain solid when it's time to short the stock.


Take **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)), featured in this column in the May 5, 2014, IBD. On Nov. 2, 2012, the nutritionals maker sank 5% and cut through the 50-day moving average in heavy trade. It had formed an unusual 10-month head-and-shoulders pattern.


On that day, IBD's research tables showed a poor RS Rating of 26. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating was neutral at C+. But Herbalife's EPS Rating was still good, a 94, and the SMR letter grade was a top-notch A. The Composite Rating, which wraps together all of these ratings plus the stock's distance from its 52-week high, was a 73.


Herbalife was trading 33% below its 52-week peak of 73 at the short-sale entry point near 50.29. By December, Herbalife crashed as low as 24.24.


**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) (featured in the Feb. 10, 2014, Short Side column) traced head-and-shoulders-like action from late 2012 to late 2013. When the stock reversed lower on Dec. 10, 2013, its IBD ratings were similar to Herbalife's: a 68 Composite, an 89 EPS, 25 RS, A for SMR, and a C- for Accumulation/Distribution.


When a stock triggers the late-stage base entry, most of the ratings will likely show strength, but the chart will not.


Mortgage servicing firm **Ocwen Financial** ([OCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCN)), the subject of the July 7 Short Side column, triggered a short sale after its late-stage base breakout past 58.34 failed. But its ratings were generally more robust: 95 Composite; 94 EPS; 77 RS; and A for SMR.


Ocwen's Accumulation/Distribution grade was horrible, a D.


Why? From Oct. 31 to Dec. 20, during which the breakout failed and new efforts to build a base ultimately fizzled out, Ocwen fell sharply in heavy volume no fewer than eight times. That damaged the Acc/Dist rating, which is based on the most recent 13 weeks of price-and-volume action.


In the case of either chart pattern, don't expect the EPS Rating to fall much. But if earnings fell hard in the most recent quarter, the EPS grade may be weaker when it's time to sell short.

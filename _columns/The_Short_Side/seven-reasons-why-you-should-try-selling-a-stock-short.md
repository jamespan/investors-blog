  Seven Reasons Why You Should Try Selling A Stock Short

If you haven't sold a stock short before, or you believe you never will, take a moment to think about the reasons why.


You may have more than one reason. The market has an upward bias, you say. (True.) Or, if your short sale goes bad, the losses are unlimited. (Theoretically, yes.) Maybe you don't know anyone who's good at it. Or you may feel it's unpatriotic.


Whatever the reason, it's never too late to try something new. The bull market today has lasted much longer than the typical bull run. For the next great bull run to arrive, the bear always must intrude and shake up the scene.


So a savvy investor keeps an open mind and seeks to expand his or her knowledge, wisdom and opportunities. Now that's the American way.


Here are seven reasons why learning how to sell former big-market leaders short may in fact sharpen your trading acumen.


**Reason No. 1**: It elevates your chart-reading skills. To identify a head-and-shoulders pattern, you need to closely look at how a stock behaves and how volume changes on a week-to-week basis, and even on a daily one. Train your eyes to see signals that institutional investors are unloading shares urgently, or that they are not so eager to buy shares after a sharp pullback.


These insights also help you determine a timely exit from your long positions.


**Reason No. 2**: You become more savvy at spotting market-topping action. Keep an eye on the distribution-day count via the [Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) (Page B8 in the latest IBD Weekly.) See how the stock market leaders are behaving. Are they breaking down? Are they failing to make new highs? Former big winners eventually become the best short-selling candidates.

**Reason No. 3**: You build a healthy sense of skepticism. In 2000, everyone appeared to be an owner of tech stocks, and most thought they knew what they were doing. Optimism was sky high.


EMC, which recently merged with **Dell Technologies** ([DVMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DVMT)), rose brilliantly in the 1990s, then peaked in 2000. As EMC topped, it formed a five-month head-and-shoulders pattern that included three charges back up above the 10-week moving average, following an initial deep sell-off that started in late September.


The data-storage king presented a short-sale opportunity in the week ended Dec. 15, reversing from a gain to cross below the 10-week moving average, near 85 in heavy volume. The short could have been covered a week later, gaining as much as 50% to 60%.


**Reason No. 4**: You become more sensitive to market cycles, and learn how to think in a contrarian way. This can help you gain the courage to buy when the market has bottomed.


**Reason No. 5**: Short selling reinforces your discipline in limiting risk. It's no different from buying stocks. Always have a sound exit strategy. Cut losses short at 8% or less. When the trade works, you must still have the discipline when the profit reaches 20% to 25%. The market-makers and funds will often come back into the stock to try to run in the shorts.


**Reason No. 6**: Counting bases becomes easier. Short sales work when you are focused on those that have been in long runs, rising 20% or more from base to base. A failed [breakout from a late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/why-the-late-stage-base-can-be-a-short-sellers-good-friend/) is a key IBD pattern for short selling.


**Reason No. 7:** You give yourself a chance to make money in down markets. Enough said?

  When Not To Sell Short: Be Wary Of A Stock With Heavy Short Interest

To be a successful short seller means you often need to take a contrarian side. But what if you are bumping knees and elbows with a bunch of other traders also thinking, hoping or wanting a relatively weak stock to go down in price?


Look out. The exact opposite just might occur.


Short selling is a contrarian activity. After all, the market has a natural upward bias. But a quick way to see if the short side of a stock is too crowded is by looking at the short interest ratio. IBD's premium stock screen and charting service [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF2) tracks this every day.


See the ratio at the top left corner of a stock's weekly chart. It shows you the number of trading days it would take short sellers to buy and cover their positions, assuming an average pace of trading. The higher the number, the more time, theoretically, it would take for these investors to exit their short positions. The ratio changes frequently, because it's computed by taking the latest report on short interest volume divided by the current average volume in the stock over the past 50 sessions.


The major exchanges provide bimonthly reports on the level of shares sold short in each publicly traded company. So the percentage change, as listed in MarketSmith, is based on the change in the most recently reported volume of shares sold short vs. the prior month.


In the May 15 edition of IBD Weekly, a news brief on page A2 noted that short sellers got caught in a short squeeze after **Wayfair** ([W](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=W)) reported first-quarter results, including a loss that was smaller than expectations, as well as a robust 29% jump in revenue to $961 million. IBD reported that almost 17 days' worth of average turnover were short positions. Huge!


Right before announcing Q1 results on May 9, the online seller of home furnishings and decor traded on average 1.1 million shares each day. Given the short interest ratio of nearly 17, this means that nearly 19 million shares were sold short. That's more than 60% of Wayfair's total float of 30 million shares.


The shorts got squeezed hard. Wayfair leapt 25% in the week ended May 12 (1), on top of solid gains in five of the six previous weeks, and has burst into all-time new high ground. From a chart perspective, Wayfair did not generate any legitimate short-sale entry points. After the August 2015 peak, Wayfair moved in a wide range, but there was no late-stage base, no head and shoulders.


What is, then, the right approach in making a short sale?


First make a list of stocks that have made a tremendous price run and are showing signs of peaking. A late-stage base may fail and offer a brief yet lucrative window of opportunity to short. So does the head and shoulders pattern, which usually takes as much as five to seven months to complete as a stock is topping.


These patterns usually form amid a high level of investor bullishness. That's why it's not easy to sell short. You are looking for an opportunity when it's not so obvious to most players that the stock is standing on very thin ice.


**Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)) worked nicely as a short sale candidate after it got added to Leaderboard as a short-sale idea on Feb. 22. Unlike Wayfair, the LED lighting expert had made a brilliant price run in 2015-2016 before topping at 280 in August. A sharp downtrend led to short-sale opportunities as the stock failed to rally above the 50-day moving average. On March 15, the short interest ratio was 6.7 times average daily volume. That may sound high, but at the time it was equivalent to 5.6 million shares, or 13% of total float.

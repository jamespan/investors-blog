Regular readers of this column know the head-and-shoulders pattern is one of two principal chart formations that boost your chances of making money on the short side.


It forms as a stock tops in price following a long run of big gains and new highs. After a sharp sell-off from the highs, the "right shoulder" typically features at least three rallies back to or above the 50-day moving average, representing hope and greed among traders. But once these brief rallies end, the sellers come in hard, dumping more shares. Supply in the stock overwhelms demand. The profit goal is 20% to 25% from the correct entry.


So, should you be looking for a short-sale opportunity in **Tesla Motors** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA))? The electric vehicle maker is still up tremendously following a sound breakout from a base at 40.10 back in the spring of 2013. Even at 220, it's risen 440%.


In a word, no, it's not a proper stock for short selling. The stock has been choppy. Yet in 2015, it created a mini version of this classic short-selling pattern. William O'Neil, who founded IBD in April 1984, says it normally takes five to seven months for the best entry in the head and shoulders to emerge. Tesla drew all of the elements of a proper one, yet squeezed it into the space of roughly four months.


As the daily chart shows, Tesla ran up sharply in June and July 2015, hitting a high of 286.65 on July 20. Then the stock pierced its 50-day moving average twice in just three weeks' time. That volatile period included the Aug. 24 flash crash. But each time, the bulls pushed shares back above the key support line.
Tesla rebounded nicely above the 50-day line a third time. By Sept. 21 it reached as high as 271.57 in heavy volume, short of a new high. The Sept. 21 action also showed stalling. Five days later, Tesla slid below its 50-day line in accelerating volume, triggering a short-sale entry near 251.50. The time to cover? On Oct. 20, less than a month later. Tesla dipped to a low of 202.50, equal to a 24.5% cash profit.


![2SHRTsd072516](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2SHRTsd072516.jpg)In 2011, stocks went into a mild bear market. Fears about Greek and Portuguese debt escalated. The credit rating of the U.S. too was under attack. The Nasdaq composite fell more than 20% from a peak of 2887. Great time to look for shorts.


After roaring strong off their lows from the 2008-2009 bear market, carmakers did not escape new sell-offs. **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) presented a six-month head-and-shoulders pattern that was easier to see than Tesla's.


First, Ford ran from 1.01 a share in 2008 to as high as 18.97 on Jan. 13, 2011, a 1,778% climb. Then shares dived hard for three straight weeks, forming the head. A 4% rebound in the week ended Feb. 11, 2011, served as the first rally back near or above the 10-week moving average **(1)**. But Ford fell hard again. It looked like a car going up an alpine slope, then running out of gas.


Ford made two more rebounds in April, rising above the 10-week line both times. But the rally stalled during the week ended April 29, setting up a seven-week slide. When Ford triggered the short sale near 15 on May 20-23, average daily volume was 63 million shares. So while the stock was cheap, liquidity was there; average dollar turnover exceeded $9oo million. The right time to cover the short position and buy back shares came in early August, as Ford dived below 11 a share.


**Honda Motor** ([HMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HMC)) made huge gains since first breaking out to new highs in the 1990s. Like Ford, the stock peaked in 2011, and a seven-month head and shoulders developed amid three rally attempts above the 50-day moving average. It took a long time for the right shoulder to form. Yet Honda crashed through the 50-day moving average in two steps, Aug. 3-4, setting up a short sale near 38.50 and six weeks later you had a 25% profit.

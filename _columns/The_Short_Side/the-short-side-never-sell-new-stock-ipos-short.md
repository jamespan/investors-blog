There are right times and wrong times to sell a stock short.


The right times? As this [column](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm), launched in December 2012, has noted, the two correct times are when a stock has either built a [late-stage base](http://education.investors.com/) frequently points out that it's unwise to buy a stock right after the bankers have priced the initial public offering and the company makes its debut on the Nasdaq or the NYSE.


With no trading history in a new stock, one simply has no idea what it is likely to do.


Savvy long-side investors will wait and watch. They let the stock find a trading zone. Then, if the stock spends the necessary amount of time (five weeks for a flat base, seven for a cup with handle or a double bottom) creating a winning chart pattern, the savvy investor can locate the correct entry point. He or she also will invest only when the market is in a confirmed uptrend.


On the short side, it's also wise to wait.


True, a few new issues will be so expertly priced by the investment bankers that the selling insiders are getting a terrific deal. The stock goes public, then nosedives because the market views the stock as too pricey.


That wasn't the case with **YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) In late 2012, the Guangzhou, China, specialist in social media and online music priced an offering of 7.8 million American depositary shares at 10.50 each on the eve of its Nov. 21 debut. **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **Deutsche Bank** ([DB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DB)) and **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C))ran the sale.


YY priced its shares at the low end of its expected price range. As IBD reported at the time, YY showed a brave face when many fellow Chinese companies postponed their plans to go public. Accounting scandals were dogging numerous U.S.-listed Chinese companies. It may have been easy to cast a negative eye toward any new Chinese listing.


But it would have been a painful mistake to short YY.


In the first week of trading, YY made a fairly tame advance to 11.32 1, 8% above its IPO price. But in the week ended Nov. 30, the stock leapt 25%. A 14% decline in the following week may have enticed some short sellers. The weekly chart, however, showed that volume during that big down week actually contracted 2 vs. the prior week.


YY went on to settle into a quieter, more controlled trading range. During two weeks in December, YY posted tight price closes 3, signs that institutions are holding on to their shares. The same thing happened in the weeks ended Jan. 18 and 25, 2013.


Short sellers really began to lose their shirts when YY broke out of a legitimate first-stage base on Feb. 14, racing past a 15.37 entry point. In 2012, YY grew its earnings by 1,325% to 57 cents a share on a 158% revenue jump. By the end of the year, YY etched a couple more bases and a 227% gain.

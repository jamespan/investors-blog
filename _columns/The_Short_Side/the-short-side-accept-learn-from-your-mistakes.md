  The Short Side: Accept, Learn From Your Mistakes

Don't be afraid to make mistakes.


This friendly word of advice applies to your long and short plays.


Did you just start reading IBD? If yes, please embrace this fact: You will make mistakes. In baseball, no one in the majors hits a single or a home run every at-bat. That's the right attitude to have in the stock market.


Naturally, one would then ask: Well, if I make mistakes, how can I make money?


And what about the situation where I make four or five losing trades in a row?


Indeed, that can be discouraging. And that's one reason every loss should be kept small — no more than 8% per trade.


Three or four trades in a row at 8% can still hurt a lot, especially when the position size is large. In such a situation, it's best to stop trading and evaluate the market. Is it too choppy? Am I buying stocks in a downtrend? Or selling short in a strong uptrend?


Take a cold, hard look at the stocks you traded. Did you really sell the former big leaders? Were you chasing? Or were you too early?


Mistakes have a silver lining, even in investing. When you take the time to learn from your mistakes, you raise the odds that the next trade will work in your favor. And in short selling, your analysis of charts will become sharper.


"It takes real knowledge, market know-how and lots of courage to sell, and particularly to sell short, because you will make many mistakes," William O'Neil, IBD founder, wrote in the foreword of IBD's [home study course](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/short-selling) on short selling. "However, I don't see how anyone can really do well in the market and protect assets if they don't learn how, when and why stocks should be sold. If a person doesn't know how to recognize when a stock is topping out and should be sold, how can he or she be sure that the very stocks he or she is buying aren't actually giving off indications that they should be sold?"


**Joy Global** ([JOY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JOY)) (EPS Rating 64, RS 13) is a great stock for short sellers to study — and keep watching. It made an amazing run after the 2008 bear market ended.


From Joy's low of 14.30 in late November that year, the mining equipment giant rallied 623% to an all-time high of 103.44 in 2011.


Then trading grew highly volatile. In the week ended Aug. 5, 2011, Joy fell 15% in heavy-duty volume. **(1)** The stock fought back, but seven weeks later it slumped 20% in big turnover in the week ended Sept. 23.


If you tried to sell shares short after big drops like that, it was a mistake. It's hard to make money going short when the stock's weakness is too obvious. You can expect the market makers, specialists and bullish institutional investors to buy shares and try to run in the shorts.


One correct entry point was in early March 2012. In the prior five months, Joy rebounded back above its 10-week moving average or bounced off the intermediate-term support line a total of four times.


The bulls eventually tired. In the week ended March 2, Joy crossed its 10-week line and dropped 5% in the heaviest weekly volume in more than a year. **(2)** That was the time to sell short, near 86. An investor could cover four weeks later for a 20% profit.

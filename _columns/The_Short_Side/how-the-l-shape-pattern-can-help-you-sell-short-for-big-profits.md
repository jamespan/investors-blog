In the art of short selling, you must use charts to find former leaders that flash serious weakness.


So as you study the charts, look for the letter L.


The L-shape pattern does not appear as frequently as the two major short-selling patterns, the head and shoulders and the faulty late-stage base. Yet if you learn how to spot it, you will sharpen your chart-reading eye. It will also hand you valuable opportunities to short a former big winner in the middle of its catastrophic decline.


IBD has discovered a sufficient number of successful examples of the L-shape to justify its use. Short selling is much more perilous than the journey of going long in stocks. That said, superb winners will at some point finally break down.


To find an L pattern, watch for a former leader to fall 25% or more in the space of just a few weeks. Such a drop can happen in only one week, as has been seen in **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) in November 2014 and Ugg boot maker **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) in May 2012.


The deep slide typically sees bulging volume -- confirm it on a weekly chart. Next, watch for the stock to move sideways for at least three weeks. Based on a study of 10 successful L-shaped patterns from 2008 to 2015, the average length of the sideways movement was 8.1 weeks, ranging from three weeks for **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) in September 2011 to 24 weeks for [former Leaderboard stock](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx) **Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) in January 2014.

But it should pale in size with the decline that initiated the L. Also, in the horizontal section of the L, the stock action may feature tight weekly closes. Volume may cool down. The point: There should be limited or no upside price progress.


Consider **Papa John's International** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)), the highly successful pizza delivery and takeout chain. The 1993 IPO made a tremendous run after the general market bottomed in March 2009. In December 2010, Papa John's broke out past a 13.78 long saucer-with-handle entry point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) and ran up all the way to as high as 79.40 last year, a gain of 476%. Over that time frame, earnings rose 132% from 90 cents a share in 2010 to $2.09 in 2015.


From July to October last year, Papa John's built a relatively shallow base but it was late-stage. The stock failed to break out. Instead, it dived hard. In the space of just two weeks, Papa sank from 74.52 to 55.93, a 25% drop. That was the start of a picture-perfect L shape. The stock traveled sideways for eight weeks, showing some tight action but no significant upside progress. That was the horizontal part of the L.


Papa John's joined the [Leaderboard Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/) on Dec. 18. A new short-sale entry emerged Jan. 6 as Papa John's crossed below the low of the pattern at 53.65. Sixteen sessions later, Papa John's hit a 42.87 low, marking a 25% gain for short sellers and the exact time to cover the position.

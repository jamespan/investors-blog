It may seem strange to make "The Short Side" a weekly column, particularly when the market itself is having a fine year so far.


With Friday's IBD Market Pulse changing the current outlook to "Confirmed uptrend," now is an awful time to sell stocks short. It's like setting out on a kayak and telling the ocean and its awesome current to bend to your will.


Yet some readers always seek a challenge.


Indeed, some stocks will keep falling even as the general market rises. The benefit of analyzing potential short sales is that it forces you to read charts more carefully.


You might want to print out each weekly chart of every candidate, then put a letter grade on the chart. So, what would give a candidate an 'A'?


One, the stock has already staged a big run during the 2009 to 2011 market comeback. Those that broke out and rose 400%, 800% or more would be ideal.


Two, is the stock rising at a weaker pace than the market or leading stocks? Is it rising at all? Can you spot [L patterns](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/012513-642046-vmware-stock-market-investing-virtualization-software.htm) forming on the weekly chart? And is the RS line fading? If you can answer yes on most or all of these questions, then you might have a beauty in your hands.


Three, is the stock's industry group performing poorly? If yes, the odds work further in your favor. Remember: IBD research has shown that up to half of the performance of a growth stock can be tied to its industry group and broad sector.


**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is part of the [Leaderboard Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/), which over the past week has seen its ranks shrink in a hurry. As noted in a sidebar to this column in IBD's April 29 edition, the yoga and athletic apparel firm had exited the Cut List on April 22 following a healthy rebound in above-average volume. **(1)**


There was good reason to be cautious, from a short seller's point of view. At the week's close of 74.14, Lululemon stood just 9% below its all-time high of 81.09. So it was in a great position to burst out of its long slump and head to new highs. In fact, that's what the stock did in May.


But on June 11, Lululemon collapsed more than 17% after reporting flat [earnings](http://news.investors.com/business/061013-659489-lululemon-athletica-ceo-steps-down-shares-fall-shares-dive.htm) for the April quarter. That broke a commendable 14-quarter streak of big increases. Quarterly sales rose 21%, the smallest bump up since 2009.


After an incredible run that saw the stock vault from a 2009 low of 2.17 to a 2013 high of 82.47, the stock now looks like a wounded animal. If attempts to rally back above the 10-week moving average stall, watch for a potential head and shoulders pattern to form. Clearly, its latest base breakout has failed, another bad sign.


**Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)) had a fine week, up 7% in higher weekly volume. But the stock has a lot of lost ground to recover. Examine the drugmaker's action in the weeks ended May 3, June 21 and June 28. They have "institutional selling" written all over. The RS Rating of 14 is ideal for a short candidate, but Allergan rose just 302% from its 2008 low of 28.95.


**Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) (5 RS) may be working on an L pattern after cratering in October and April.  **Joy Global** ([JOY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JOY)) (19 RS) faces a test of upside resistance at its 10-week line after falling seven weeks in a row.

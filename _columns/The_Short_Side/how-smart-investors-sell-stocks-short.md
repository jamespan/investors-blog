Savvy short sellers pay sharp attention to price and volume. Not just one or the other, but both.


So when you are poised to take a short position, don't hit the sell button yet. Take a big breath. Then ask yourself this: Have you already seen instances of heavy volume as the stock fell in price?


Yes? Good. Your odds of success are higher.


You don't want to sell a stock short, hoping that fund managers will follow your lead and soon unload big heaps of shares. First get confirmation that volume is really coming into a stock as it falls in price. These details — best seen on a daily or weekly chart — tell you the market's big pockets are making a major exit.


If you know the [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/122812-638723-smart-short-selling-dollar-tree-stock.htm?ntt=Dollar+Tree+Short+Side) well, then you already know to be on the lookout for such a relationship between price and volume. If you do not, please go through the [archives](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm) of this column, accessible through the search box of Investors.com.


Heavy downside trade indicates that the balance of supply and demand in the stock is tilting toward the former. When traders are more anxious to sell their positions than those who are willing to buy, prices will fall.


Consider **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) in the twilight of the outstanding bull run from 2003 to 2007. The "Name your own price" innovator in online travel booking had scored a superb rally from its May 2006 breakout at 25.08 to a peak of 144.34 in May 2008.


That 476% rally signified Priceline was a true market leader. But even leaders can crash. And that's what the Norwalk, Conn., e-commerce play did during the second half of 2008, falling 69% from that 144.34 peak in just 25 weeks.


**Spot The Chart Flaws**


The nine-week cup that formed from December 2007 to February 2008 was the antithesis of a well-formed base. It abounded with wild weekly swings. The cup was V-shaped, not well-rounded. This hinted that institutional money managers were selling hard, eager to book their profits (and perhaps book a vacation).


The base was fourth stage, which meant that the odds of a stand-up breakout were low. It had three down weeks in heavy volume but just one up week.


Priceline struggled soon after breaking out to new highs in the week ended Feb. 15, 2008. A base on base formed. The stock made one more high-volume breakout attempt past an entry near 132 nearly three months later. That turned out to be the peak.


Short sellers could have gained confidence in their analysis when Priceline dropped sharply and cut below the 10-week moving average in big volume in the weeks ended June 27 and July 4 respectively **(1)**. Priceline's action also resembled a four-month head-and-shoulders pattern.


**Know when to cover**


Short-sale entries emerged during failed attempts to reclaim the 10-week moving average, in the weeks ended Aug. 1 **(2)** and Sept. 19 **(3)**. Each time, a short seller could have quickly covered for a tidy 25% profit.


Priceline shows why one should never sit on a short play, no matter how good the trade is. The stock took out the 144 peak in 2009 and has built a brand new set of bases. Today, it's near 1,200.

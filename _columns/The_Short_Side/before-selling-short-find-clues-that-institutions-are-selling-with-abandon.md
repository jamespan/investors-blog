In the risky business of betting that a stock will go down in price after you sell short, how can you improve your odds of success?


One way is to spot heavy sell-offs in huge volume. Plus, use the weekly chart as your guide.


If a stock has peaked in price, it then follows that the supply of shares that large funds are willing to hand over to the public outweighs the amount of shares that current holders and new buyers seek to own. So when the balance shifts from heavy demand to heavy supply, expect a former huge winner to fall 5%, 10% or even more in a single week on a whale of volume.


Aruba Networks, acquired by **Hewlett-Packard** ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) in May 2016, helped command the 2009-11 market rally. After bottoming at 1.85 in November 2008, the specialist in local-area wireless internet access shot up 1,867% to a peak of 36.40. In late December 2009, Aruba cleared a 10.06 buy point in a 16-week base, then broke out of a new cup with handle at 14.44 on June 14, 2010. Nine months later, Aruba bounded as much as 141%.

The base was less than four weeks long and V-shaped — two major faults. On top of that, the base itself was a later-stage one. Notice how the V-shaped base featured a nearly 8% weekly loss in volume that expanded 18% above the 10-week average **(1)**. Imagine a torpedo striking the hull of a big ship. A few direct hits like that, and the ship can sink fast.


Aruba surely did.


An April 25 breakout past the 34.97 entry failed fast. Five days later, Aruba got hammered with three straight down days, sinking to as low as 30.85. Those who bought at 34.97 had to cut losses. Short sellers could have initiated a trade at 32.52 **(2)**, then cover the short just a few weeks later for a gain of as much as 27%.


Let's say you missed that initial short-sale entry. No problem. Keep spying that weekly chart, and you'll see that it soon suffered another torpedo week, falling more than 15% in the week ended May 20, 2011, in the heaviest weekly turnover since its March 2007 IPO **(3)**; during that week, almost 34 million shares changed hands.


Aruba rallied sharply for three weeks in a row, but deflating weekly volume hinted at deflating demand **(4)**. Such poor price-and-volume action helped set up a second short-sale entry in July. Why? The stock rallied back briefly above the 10-week moving average, but rolled over again.


When you short a former big winner, ratings and rankings matter little. Aruba was No. 2 in the IBD 50 in the May 2, 2011, paper. The ratings were 98 Composite, 99 EPS, and 98 RS. Aruba showed plenty of volume at the peak, trading on average 2.9 million shares a day.


Just as Aruba broke down in the faulty base on May 3 and 4, the [market went into correction](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) amid a cluster of three straight distribution days. The Nasdaq composite fell from its May 2 peak of 2887 to an Oct. 4 low of 2298, a 20.4% correction. During that bear-market-size correction of 2011, fellow IBD 50 names **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) and **EZCorp** ([EZPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EZPW)) also got hit by torpedo sell-offs and offered their own short sale entries.

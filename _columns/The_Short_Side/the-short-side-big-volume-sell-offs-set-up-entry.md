If you desire to become an accomplished short seller, you'll need to develop and master many skills.


One of the most important ones? The ability to detect unequivocally heavy selling by fund managers, just as a stock marks its top and heads south.


Every day, a stock rises or falls. The new investor, citing this obvious fact, may initially disregard stock charts.


But a savvy, battle-tested short seller knows that only a stock chart highlights the presence of severe selling, which usually leads to more heavy selling and a narrow window of opportunity to profit from a stock's downside.


**How much volume?**


Watching volume as a stock rises or falls is key. So as you use a daily or weekly chart, look for big bursts of volume when a former leader falls 5%, 10%, 15% or more in a single day or week.


On a weekly chart, volume on a big down week should tower over its 10-week moving average. That weekly volume bar may be the highest in weeks or months.


If a stock is strong, it will rebound quickly from that setback, often in active trading. But if a stock is weak, expect its price and volume gains to be mild and slow. Over time, the action creates bearish chart patterns, such as a head and shoulders, a late-stage breakout failure, or the L-pattern. (Please see the [archives](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm) in Investors.com for more on all of these topics.)


**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) was featured in the Short Side [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/071213-663579-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm?ntt=The+Short+Side+Lululemon+Saito-Chung) in IBD's July 15, 2013, edition. The column noted that the yogawear retailer experienced a "torpedo" of heavy selling on June 11, 2013. As seen on a weekly chart, the stock tore through its 10-week moving average line in massive volume **1**. It was down nearly 19% that week, the second worst weekly drop since the stock began a multiyear stretch run with a strong breakout from a 10-week consolidation in the week ended July 24, 2009.


That was not the time to sell short. IBD's rule is not to short when it's so obvious the stock is experiencing weakness.


Indeed, after falling another 6%, Lululemon made a steady climb back above its 10-week moving average. By early October, the stock reached as high as 77.75, up 30% from the late-June low.


The rally didn't last. Lululemon dove back below the 10-week line, then made a third recovery attempt. It was weak. Lululemon gapped down 12% on Dec. 12 **2**.


A viable short-sale entry arrived Dec. 10 and 11, as the stock dropped 2% and 1% respectively in fast trade.


Other instances of extreme-volume selling include **Nationstar Mortgage** ([NSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NSM)) (average volume of 1.2 million shares), which slid 28% in the week ended Nov. 8. A five-week retracement rally failed to send the stock back above its 10-week moving average, which by then was imitating the slope of an Olympic downhill.


**Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) (1.6 million shares) collapsed 26% in massive trade in the week ended Dec. 6. It's now trying to traverse above the 10-week line. **Lumber Liquidators** ([LL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LL)) (1.1 million shares) suffered torpedo sell-offs in the weeks ended Nov. 22 and Dec. 13. The stock is working on a potential new first-stage base.

Short sellers have a bad guy image.

  

Hedge fund manager Scott Fearon would like to change that perception. Fearon, along with writer Jesse Powell, authored "Dead Companies Walking: How a Hedge Fund Manager Finds Opportunity in Unexpected Places."

  

The book reads like a detective novel. Fearon visits companies and tries to figure out what's likely to happen for good or bad. And good is a possibility. While Fearon will short stocks, it doesn't dominate his investing approach.

  

"The bulk of what I do is long," he told IBD.

  

Fearon's hedge fund Crown Capital Management has delivered an annualized return of 11.4% since its founding in 1990 vs. about 8% for the S&P 500 (excluding dividends).

  

"Dead Companies Walking" argues that what's bad for a troubled company isn't necessarily bad for the U.S. economy.

  

"Bankruptcy is good for the economy," Fearon said.

  

He calls bankruptcy a far better "regulatory tool" than the Dodd-Frank law.

  

Free-market advocates would agree. Capitalism works best when money is flowing into strong operations, not into crippled efforts that government is trying to keep alive.

  

For individual investors who short stocks, "Dead Companies Walking" has some lessons.

  

• **Scout the 52-week lows**: The list (in today's paper on B2) is something Fearon scans every day. He calls the 52-week low list "a perfect universe for finding shorts."

  

• **Look for weak industries** : Pay phones, cable TV and the Yellow Pages are sun-setting industries that should be avoided.

  

"I read your newspaper every day, and (IBD founder Bill) O'Neil is right about growth," Fearon said. Buying troubled stocks on valuation is a "death strategy."

  

• **Don't try for the peak**: "I like to short stocks when they've declined at least 50% off the high," Fearon said.

  

• **Correct mistakes**: "It's OK to be wrong," Fearon said. "It's not OK to stay wrong." He sets his exit at minus 20%, which might seem high to IBD-style investors. However, Fearon's best shorts are companies headed to bankruptcy, which keeps the ledger positive.

  

• **Mind the store**: Fearon says retail has more failures than any other sector. "Retail is brutal," he said.

  

• **Don't short**: Say again? Yes, Fearon says that the individual investor shouldn't be shorting stocks. "Your risk is unlimited," he said. John Q. Public doesn't have the time to devote to research and follow the stocks closely, he says.

  

If there's a bottom line lesson in "Dead Companies Walking," Fearon says it's this: "Bright people make poor decisions, and that's OK." And letting inefficient companies go bankrupt "makes our economy the model for the world."

  

Fearon says his share of the profits from "Dead Companies Walking" will go to charity. Fearon is the founder of Oak Hill School in Marin County, Calif., a school for children with autism.

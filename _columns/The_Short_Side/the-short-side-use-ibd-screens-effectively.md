The market is like the ocean. In one spot of the earth, the waters are calm and soothing. In another spot, a hurricane may be building.


So even as major indexes may be rising in a gentle fashion, certain stocks are falling hard after having their day (or literally years) in the sun.


Where can you look for good shorting ideas â€” even in a market that is behaving mildly?


IBD offers plenty of places. To discover top-rated stocks that are suddenly breaking down in heavy trade, the Stocks On The Move table (today on Page B7 and always on the home page of Investors.com) and the "Stocks Down" portion of Timesaver Table (today on B13) are excellent places to begin. Focus on those that are down in price with volume increases of at least 50% more than their daily average.


With a large-cap stock, you can also view volume changes of 20% to 30% beyond normal levels as indicators of a mass exit by the savviest institutional investors.


After **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) peaked at 705.07 on Sept. 21, the technology giant fell 1.3%, 2.5% and 1.2% in the next three sessions.


Volume spiked above average in each of those days. Apple sported a 98 Composite and a 92 Relative Price Strength Rating at the time.


It made the Stocks On the Move table on Sept. 25 and Sept. 27.


In the stock tables of IBD's Sept. 26 edition, the Sector Leader was underlined, meaning the stock fell significantly in heavy trade.


Apple was also fourth on the list of down stocks in the TimeSaver Table in the Sept. 25 IBD. Less than two weeks later, the stock caved below its 50-day moving average en route to a late-stage breakout failure.


While you cogitate about short-selling candidates, you can think about the market this way: Are you seeing certain companies that are getting a lot of press and TV airtime week in, week out? You know that eventually the stock's party will end.


Fallen angels from the Leaderboard and IBD 50 can be a good source of ideas.


MarketSmith's "Stocks Breaking Down" folder in the Growth 250 feature is also a good place to start a wide search.


IBD searched for stocks meeting the following criteria: EPS Rating of 85 or higher; a share price of at least 30; an RS Rating of 20 or less; average daily volume of 800,000 shares or more; trading no more than 30% below its 52-week high.


Three companies showed up: **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)), **Citrix Systems** ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)) and **Cognizant Technology Solutions** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)).


Allergan recently produced an L pattern before collapsing in the past two weeks.


Increase the screen's RS Rating to 35 or less, and more stocks, including **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)), join the list.


The business software leader got gobs of space in IBD's Internet & Technology section during its long run since 2004. From its August 2004 low, Salesforce has risen as much as 2,033%.


After the 2008-to-early-2009 bear market ended, the stock ramped up to all-time highs.


These days, it has been showing some classic topping signs.


In addition to falling fast in massive volume in recent weeks, Salesforce.com recently staged a 4-for-1 [stock split](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/613078-stock-splits-can-signal-a-peak-in-share-prices.htm?Ntt=sell-signal-stock-splits) .

  The Short Side: When Few Late-Stage Bases Appear, Hide Like The Bears

It's only April, yet 2016 already offers a fine teaching moment for those who wish to sell shares short.


If you've had success on the short side this year, relish it. You likely capitalized on the sell-off that began Jan. 4 and flipped investors down like an Olympic judo athlete.


Yet stocks went through the wringer for only a month. The Nasdaq composite bottomed out on Feb. 11 with a "pink rally day" in which the major index closed lower, but finished well in the upper half of the day's trading range. Three days later, it posted a solid follow-through on Feb. 17, rising 2.2% in higher volume. It clanged the bell for the market bulls, confirming a possible [new uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/nasdaq-stages-another-follow-through-but-new-stock-highs-still-look-wafer-thin/) in place, and warned the bears to watch out.


The first takeaway? Markets tend to give narrow windows of opportunity for the short seller. You have to be on your toes, like a pro tennis player awaiting an opponent's 95-mile-an-hour serve. And when you're right, don't get too greedy. Covering your short positions for gains of 20% to 25%, sometimes in the 10% to 15% range, sends you safely back to the sidelines, real profits in hand. Any stock can rise on a short squeeze, in which large institutions and market makers try to rattle the short sellers with a surge of buy orders.


Another takeaway: Did you notice how the washout virtually removed all high-performance stocks from late-stage base territory? Regular readers of this [column](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/the-short-side-apples-late-stage-breakout-failure/) know that one of the two basic short-sale chart patterns to spot is when a leading stock clears a buy point in a third-, fourth- or later-stage base and then fails badly. When that stock hits the 8% stop-loss price level, it's the time to short. But with so few stocks making late-stage breakouts lately, the market has in effect reduced the pool of stocks in which to fish for great short trades.


Take a look at companies making Friday's Your Weekly Review screen (Pages A5 to A8). Scan the concise chart analysis at the bottom of each weekly minichart. Then peer at the charts in the IBD 50 in Monday's IBD on pages B1, B3 and B4. The words "late-stage base" appear only sporadically. Quite a change from mid- to late 2015.


One more takeaway. The best time to sell stocks short is when the Market Pulse in IBD's Big Picture notes the market is in correction. But if the correction is brief, or the market is flitting between "confirmed uptrend" and "uptrend under pressure," the lack of a clear downward direction can make it extremely tough to make money on the short side.


In such an environment, it makes sense to be more cautious and trade less, even if good patterns form. Even a good-looking head-and-shoulders pattern does not guarantee a short sale will work.![ShrtSd042216](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ShrtSd042216.jpg)


Consider **Kansas City Southern** ([KSU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSU)), which got added to Leaderboard Cut List on Feb. 2 as it closed at 69.99. The railroad had been failing to retake its 10-week moving average for months after its November 2014 peak at 126.49. These false rallies can serve as a secondary short-sale entry point.


But on Feb. 9, Kansas City exited the Cut List as its rally gained momentum. Those who sold short near had to cover and cut their losses at 8% or less. The stock continues to chug higher amid a "cash into trash" buying rush of commodity stocks.

If Bob Dylan were an active short seller, he might describe January as being like a rolling stone.


Indeed, trading aggressively when a market is rolling lower is one edge you attain when you wish to sell stocks short with success.

What other steps can you take right now to gain more of an edge?


First, familiarize yourself with IBD’s principles of short selling. Read past stories of this monthly column at Investors.com. If necessary, read them a second time. On the home page of IBD’s revamped Investors.com website, type in “The Short Side” in the search box found in the upper-right corner. Then browse through two dozen stories over the past two years.


Topics include the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern and the late-stage base breakdown. The July 2015 column highlights “torpedo sell-offs,” clues that, for a given stock, supply is overwhelming demand. The February 2015 column describes a secondary short-sale entry point, the L-shape pattern.


The May 2015 story highlights how you can use the 10-week moving average to discover additional entries to a stock's further downside.


Second, keep your emotions in check. You’ve likely seen many a stock dropping severely lately. Such action may stimulate the brain and the heart to believe the decline has a long way to go.


That may be true. Still, rules are critical. Do not chase a stock on its way down. If the proper entry in a head-and-shoulders pattern is, say, 80, then any short sale below 76.20 would be extended. Why? You want to sell short no more than 5% below that ideal entry point.


Even if a short sale is working, a large fund trying to defend its position in the stock or a market maker may try to run in the shorts by buying furiously to try to trigger a rebound. You don’t want to get caught in such a melee.


Third, pay close attention to the character of the market’s current leaders and other stocks in the industry group you are keeping in your sights. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) symbolizes the big run that numerous restaurant chains have enjoyed in the stock market since the major bottom in March 2009. The burrito and taco restaurant chain hit a low of 36.86 and hustled 1,958% to a peak of 758.61 in August. Such a move made it vulnerable to a big slide.


The stock has fallen like, well, a heavy burrito since it triggered a short entry in late October, as its late-stage breakout collapsed and the stock pierced the 10-week moving average. Perhaps another attempt to retake the 10-week line may generate a secondary entry.


In the middle-ranked restaurant industry group, thinly traded **Chuy’s** ([CHUY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHUY)) and **McDonald’s** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) are outperforming the major indexes. But the group is also dripping of weakness. For instance, **El Pollo Loco** ([LOCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LOCO)) has fallen more than 70% from its all-time high of 41.70.


Leaderboard's Cut List features pizza delivery chain **Papa John’s** ([PZZA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PZZA)), which has given disciplined short sellers a double-digit gain since it built an L-shape pattern and triggered a short near 56.

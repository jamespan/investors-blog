Emotions may span from relief to pure joy when a short sale in a former big growth stock winner turns lucrative. Amid that web of emotions, you need a clear-cut rule to ensure you actually come out of the trade with a solid gain.


The rule is exactly the same for short sellers as it is for those who use IBD's research and charts to go long in a stock. Cover your short position and buy back shares when the gain reaches 20% to 25%.


As an example, let's say you sold a stock short at 100. If it falls 20 points to 80, you cover the position for a 25% gain. You've effectively "bought" shares (for the sake of returning them to the lender of the stock) at 80 and "sold" the shares at 100.


The reasons for following this rule are clear. One, short selling is challenging, especially when the market is not in a severe correction. The market has an upward bias. So even if a stock is a good short candidate, it will often see big price moves up. You could see your double-digit gains from a short evaporate fast.


Two, taking gains consistently at 20% to 25% will help you easily offset your losses. Always cut your losses and cover your short position when a stock rises 7% to 8% above your short-sale price.


Three, by taking your gains calmly when this rule triggers, you avoid getting emotionally attached to the position. It's natural to root for the stock to go all the way down to $1 a share. Don't let your feelings get the best of you.


In some former big winners, there may be more than one opportunity to make a 20% profit on the short side. That would be almost equivalent to making a larger gain in a single trade.


**Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)), the Vermont-based coffee roaster, became a market star in the 2000s due to its revolutionary single-cup-serving coffee brewers.


The stock formed a nearly five-month [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/052915-754890-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) from late August 2014 to January this year. The highest price in the head 1, 158.87, marked an 829% gain from Keurig's July 2012 low of 17.11. Quite a move.


As the pattern's right shoulder formed, the 10-week moving average snuffed out Keurig's attempts to continue its big rally. It failed at least three times to reclaim the key support line, which then began to slope lower.


A falling 10-week line means the stock's price trend is down. It boosts the odds that a short seller can make money.


Keurig joined the [Leaderboard Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/) on April 13. Around that time, Keurig logged four up weeks, all of which were relatively mild gains. Volume was meek 2, a sign of cooling demand.


The up week, ended May 1, offered a timely short-sale entry near 120. Keurig plunged more than 12% in active trade the next week on disappointing quarterly results. Earnings per share fell 5%, the second straight quarterly fall; sales were up just 2%.


A short seller could have covered a week later after Keurig plunged below 100.


Another short sale opportunity emerged in early August 3.


Short sellers at either entry may have wanted to hold out longer for a bigger gain. Yet the longer the holding period, the higher the probability that a strong rebound may occur and threaten to wipe out gains.

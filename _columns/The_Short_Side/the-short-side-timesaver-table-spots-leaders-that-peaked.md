IBD's "Making Money" section is built to help people buy stocks in hopes of making big profits.


So, are there any features to help short sellers find great candidates headed for the downside? Yes.


A few of the section's features highlight marquee names that are falling in heavy volume. As last month's [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/020714-689340-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm?ntt=Short+Side+Saito-Chung) noted, a big percentage drop in big volume following a long run-up is a precious clue to weakness. Future action by the stock may give the alert chart reader a chance to pick up a 20% to 25% profit in short time.


One such feature is IBD's Timesaver table, found every day in the paper and today on Page B13. The table's left side lists stocks with very strong Composite Ratings that made big moves up in price. The table's right side shows those that fell sharply the previous day.


On the table's right side, focus on the stocks with a Composite of 95 or higher (their Composite rank is boldfaced). Ideally, they will also show above-average volume, as indicated by data in the "Vol % Chg" column.


If you've been spying a stock that has made a strong price run for the past year and a half or longer, and then it repeatedly shows up in the right side of the Timesaver table, it's time to analyze the charts for potential short-sale patterns to emerge. They include the head and shoulders and the breakout failure from a late-stage base.


You may also get clues of former market leaders breaking down by studying the down-in-price section of IBD's daily Stocks On The Move table (today on Page B7). The same table is updated in real time on Investors.com. Also, the "Stocks Breaking Down" folder inside the Growth 250 feature of [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com/) will give you timely ideas.


In the summer of 2011, the Nasdaq composite fell 19% in just four weeks. At the time, which stocks were getting the spotlight in IBD?


In IBD's July 8, 2011, edition — one day after the Nasdaq peaked — **Carbo Ceramics** ([CRR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRR)) made the top of the Timesaver table with a 4.15-point drop to 167.30 **1** despite striking a new high. The "Vol % Chg" figure was +26, meaning that Carbo's volume in the July 7 session was 26% higher than its 50-day average.


At the time, average volume was 554,000 shares, less than the 800,000-share minimum threshold you'd normally like to see. However, Carbo shares were trading well above $100 a share, so the average dollar volume was more than ample at $92.5 million.


So, what was going on with Carbo's stock? Just a day earlier, shares cleared a 169.44 cup-without-handle buy point, but volume was thin **2**, a bad sign. The next day, July 7, Carbo let nice gains reverse into a sharp loss.


The maker of ceramic proppants for oil and gas drillers boasted nifty ratings: a 99 Composite, 95 EPS, and 97 RS. But the poorly formed cup was third stage. Most growth stocks do not make much headway after the breakout from a third or later-stage base.


Carbo rose a few more weeks in light trade and hit a high of 183.34. Then the stock U-turned into a vertical-style decline. On July 29, Carbo undercut the 50-day moving average and triggered the 8% stop-loss sell rule.


It was also the right time to sell shares short. Six days later, Carbo dropped 30%, giving short sellers a nice gain in quick time.

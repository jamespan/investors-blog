William O'Neil has two pieces of advice for aspiring short sellers.


One, concentrate on the huge winners, especially after they make a devastating decline in a single day or week. Two, study closely the charts of these former market leaders that top and fall hard. The more nuances you grasp, the smarter a short seller you become.


What are truly big winners in the market? Such stocks tend to lead the way by hitting new highs constantly for a few years â€” not just a few weeks or months.


O'Neil, who founded Investor's Business Daily in 1984, recommends investors to target these sorts of stocks, even though they represent companies that sell fantastic products, own the No. 1 or 2 spot in their field, or boast highly talented management. The reason: Once a great stock tops, the average decline is more than 70%.


"You should be covering your short once you have a gain of 20% to 25%," O'Neil told IBD. "But you can also get several more chances to sell the stock again when it is coming up to its 50-day line."


Once such a stock has topped, you'll usually see one week in which the stock drops 10%, 20% or more in a single week. Volume explodes. That is the footprint of institutional money managers getting rid of the stock. It signals a sea change in market psychology.


"If the stock breaks down so bad that it actually goes below the work you see on the left side of the base, this almost always guarantees that it's in deep trouble," O'Neil said.


That's also the worst time to begin selling shares short. The decline is too obvious for most traders to see the stock is now weak. "The part-time investor will try to short the stock. That's where you get run in, and it can happen two or three times," O'Neil said.


Let's study Lucent Technologies, one of the premier telecom stocks during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. It made a monster run from its initial breakout in September 1996, rising more than 750% in a little more than three years. From April 1998 to April 1999, Lucent split its shares 2-for-1 twice in the space of just one year, a danger signal.


The stock formed a wide-and-loose late-stage base from July to November 1999. The breakout to new highs lasted only for a few weeks. Then in the week ended Jan. 7, 2000 1, Lucent crashed 28% in the biggest weekly volume ever. That was the one big break that destroyed all of the stock's base-building the prior year.


But that was also the wrong time to short shares. The bulls pushed the stock back above the key 10-week moving average. Before a proper short sale entry appears, the stock must generally fall through and recover above the 10-week line several times before really breaking down.


O'Neil notes that the stock may have fooled investors to think the stock was strengthening when it briefly rose above 60 during the week ended July 21. In reality, Lucent had staged at least four rallies across its 10-week line before finally triggering a short sale entry near 56, as it fell back through the line in strong trade. By October 2001, Lucent fell to 5.

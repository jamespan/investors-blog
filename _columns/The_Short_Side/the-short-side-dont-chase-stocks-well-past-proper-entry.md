  The Short Side: Don't Chase Stocks Well Past Proper Entry

Don't chase.


If you have been reading IBD for a while, particularly Investor's Corner, Stock Spotlight and the new product Leaderboard, you know exactly what this means.


When a stock breaks out, you strive to buy as close as possible to the proper entry. If a stock shapes a cup with handle, that entry point is a dime above the highest price within the handle area. In a double bottom, it's 10 cents past the middle peak in the W.


Buy more than 5% past that proper entry, and you're chasing.


Why is chasing bad?


Numerous leaders often retreat briefly to the proper entry after running up for a few days or weeks. Suppose you bought a good stock at 60 when the proper entry was 52. If the stock falls back 6 points, or 10%, you must cut your loss and sell the stock. But those who bought at 52 or 53 can sit and hold. For them, the 8% loss sell rule did not trigger.


Those who bought at 60 are hurt â€” possibly twice. One, they took a quick loss. Two, they might see the stock rebound into a big winner without owning shares.


If you sell a stock short, exercise the same trading discipline.


This means selling shares as close as possible to the proper entry, be it a fall below the 10-week moving average line or a drop below the proper buy point in a flawed base breakout. If you wait 5 or 10 points after the fact, you might be forced to cover the short as market makers and fund managers come in with big buy orders to shore up the stock.


**VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) produced a short-sale entry near 99 during the week ended Aug. 5, 2011. The leader in computer server virtualization software was a big winner before and after the 2008-09 bear market.


But by the summer of 2011, the big-cap tech's base was the third since VMware jumped out of a first-stage, base-on-base pattern at 34.30 back in August 2009. A third stage isn't necessarily late-stage. But risk is certainly elevated. The market itself was on shaky ground.


On July 26, 2011, IBD's market outlook fell into "correction" status after the S&P 500 chalked up seven distribution days.


VMware sliced through its 10-week moving average in the first week of August in heavy volume 1. It closed that week down 13% at 87.28, well below the 99.29 buy point created by a nearly six-month, base-on-base pattern after a flat base emerged following a poorly built double bottom.


If you had waited until sometime the next week to sell shares short, you were late. Trading grew even more volatile. The stock reversed higher for a 4% gain. It moved up an additional 5% early the next week, making it likely that latecomers were forced to cover their shorts.


Although the stock finished that week down 15%, VMware surged more than 14% over the following two weeks. If you had sold shares near 99, however, you could buy back shares near 79 for a fast 25% profit.


**Nokia** ([NOK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOK)) provides a similar lesson with its breakdown the week ended March 7, 2008. The proper entry in its narrow, head-and-shoulders pattern was 35, letting short sellers cover near 29 three weeks later for a 20% gain.


The former tech leader surged 15% the next two weeks, cleaning up the late shorts.

Even for experienced traders and investors in growth stocks, [selling stocks short](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/the-short-side-can-you-avoid-these-5-common-mistakes-in-short-selling/) can prove a highly difficult venture. After all, even amid a [stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-slammed-1151-points-on-coronavirus-fears-will-stay-at-home-stocks-win-big-in-2020/?preview_id=5593734&preview_nonce=10ae621796&post_format=standard&_thumbnail_id=2327235&preview=true), prices can swing very fast. Yet there's good news on the technology front.




Brooklyn, N.Y.-based TradeZero America has built patent-pending technology to lower the long-term costs of finding stocks that are hard to locate for shorting. And the online broker dealer, launched in 2019, has differentiated itself from other online trading platforms with a system that enables users to gain a credit for such securities.


Typically, you won't have trouble selling shares of, say, a [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/dow-jones-today-dow-stocks-stock-market-news/) stock short. Your broker should easily find shares to borrow from another shareholder. (When closing a short sale, you buy back shares on the open market, then return those borrowed shares anonymously to the investor who lent them to you.)

Short Selling During A Stock Market Crash: One Challenge
--------------------------------------------------------


But not all stocks are easy to borrow — even with a hot stock that holds a big gain and sees its average daily turnover bulge.


"We've brought down the costs of locates (for a stock), bringing back 25% to 50% of the cost back to the customer," Dan Pipitone, co-founder of TradeZero, told IBD. "Once you're done with a locate, even if you didn't short it, or you covered, you can use the locate and mark it as a credit. You can sell it to someone else."

Since the launch of this stock locating service in July 2019, TradeZero customers "have recycled millions of shares for symbols that were out of supply with our vendor suppliers," Pipitone said. Vendors include the Nasdaq and NYSE. "We have provided short ability for tens of thousands more short trades done by having this functionality."


A veteran in fintech technology long before the word "fintech" got coined, Pipitone worked at Real Time Quotes in 1997 and helped to roll out one of the first services offering Level II stock price quotes over the public internet. Level II shows users specific bid and ask prices and the number of shares for these orders.


Two years later, Pipitone started Noble Trading, then sold the firm in 2010 to Light Speed Trading.


Low Share Float? Tough To Find Shares? Not Necessarily
------------------------------------------------------



In recent weeks, as the threat of coronavirus has instilled fear over the stock market and companies' earnings prospects for at least the first quarter of 2020, TradeZero has seen **Arkadia Biosciences** ([RKDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RKDA)), **Novavax** ([NVAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVAX)), **Co-Diagnostics** ([CODX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CODX)) and **Genprex** ([GNPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNPX)) crack the top 10 in terms of stocks requesting share locating for selling short. And no wonder. The average float of these four companies comes in at just 12 million shares, with Novavax holding the most at 26 million shares and Genprex the least at 4 million shares.



Within the top 20 most located stocks on the TradeZero platform, it may come as no surprise that recent highfliers such as **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) and **Virgin Galactic** ([SPCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPCE)) have joined the list.


In the second quarter, the firm will offer the ability of customers to bid for locates for shares that are out of inventory. "These bids may potentially motivate those customers that are currently holding the locate to sell what they are holding to recoup a larger part of the cost for getting into the locate, or potentially profit from selling the locate," Pipitone said. "This is another innovation used to mitigate the dreaded 'No shares available' message to short sellers. The interest has been pretty overwhelming."

  Why Selling IPOs Short Is Fraught With Risk

One of the most hyped technology stocks of this decade became one of the biggest flops in the public stock market.


**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) proved as luscious as a summer peach for short sellers after it spiked to an opening week high of 45 last year, then did a hairpin turn below 20 a share just 11 weeks later. But know this: Selling IPOs short profitably is not easy. In fact, it's best to avoid them entirely.


We all have the benefit of hindsight in talking about the top dog in social networking. Still, a post-analysis is worthwhile.


Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was Time's 2010 man of the year â€” long before the stock went public on May 18, 2012. He made the cover of many other publications in the months leading up to the large-cap company's Nasdaq debut. The point: When a company's success has become obvious to the general public, the stock's upside has largely been achieved.


Investment bankers continued hiking the expected price range of the offering price, saying that demand justified the increases. Meanwhile, more-sober reports pointed out that the company was already seeing a deceleration in quarterly earnings growth. That's a no-no for investors looking for new market winners.


When the stock finally hit the public market at 38 a share, it moved as high as 45, then finished the week at 38.23 near the bottom of the weekly range. **(1)** The reversal was ugly. It got worse. Facebook fell 16.5%, 13% and 2% in the next three weeks. A two-week rebound didn't turn the tide.


The market was sick. On May 4, 2012, just two weeks before Facebook's debut, IBD's Market Pulse downshifted the outlook to "Market in correction" from "Uptrend under pressure."


Despite all of these negatives that surrounded the stock, shorting the stock just days or weeks after the market debut is fraught with risk. A stock can trade wildly before it settles into a range that allows you to more soundly examine the forces of supply and demand that will affect its future performance.


"It's a hot potato. I would probably avoid it," Scott O'Neil, MarketSmith president, told IBD. "Facebook had an odor to it before it went public. But you don't have any confirmation from a chart. You would have to do tremendous research (before selling shares short)."


**YY Inc.** ([YY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YY)) shows a bad reversal does not always trigger further downside ahead. The stock dropped 14% in its third week of public life. **(2)** But price action tightened up. Earnings and revenue are growing sharply at the new China dot-com phenom.


Stock brokers might not even have shares of a brand new stock to lend you for shorting. They're likely more desperate to get a piece of the inventory to sell to clients who want to own shares.


Some successful money managers who make a living on the short side do have a yen for identifying over-hyped companies whose valuations do not justify the underlying fundamentals. These market players usually have decades of experience, a smart team of analysts, a lot of cash to work with. Those are enviable edges. As an individual trader, you gain an edge by focusing on proper chart set-ups and risk control.

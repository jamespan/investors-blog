If you truly want to master the art of short selling, never violate this rule: Consider selling short only those stocks that have made astounding gains. Is "astounding" hard to quantify? Not really. It generally applies to equities that have moved up 300% to 400% or more in price. A gain that large could get bigger. But it may also mean the stock is near a peak.


If you try to short a stock that has risen, say, 50% or 100% in price, the trade may work out. But you might also find that the stock is so strong that it could double again. Avoid getting caught short in such a stock.


When a stock has tripled or quadrupled in price, investors' expectations have likely overheated. Wild price action becomes commonplace, and institutions who got in early are now getting out. One piece of negative news — often a miss on earnings or a dull sales outlook — is all it takes for the stock to slide lower.


Look for other signs that the stock has likely topped. They include a large stack of bases formed over its run, [a climax run](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner/612599-how-to-recognize-climax-top.htm).


Today's column highlights the [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/052915-754890-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) that **Biogen** ([BIIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIIB)) traced from February to July of this year. The stock crossed the 50-day moving average at 398 on July 22, triggering a short sale.


One could have covered just two sessions later on July 24 for a gain of more than 30%.


On that day, the big-cap biotech plunged 22% on second-quarter results. Both EPS growth and sales growth decelerated sharply. Biogen also reduced its full-year revenue growth target and said that its Tysabri drug failed to hit its primary endpoint in a clinical trial for stroke victims.


Why did the stock become an attractive short?


In late October 2010, the multiple sclerosis drugmaker broke out of a first-stage cup with handle with a 58.74 buy point, then raced higher. By the end of 2012, the stock shaped another base and broke out again. The gain grew as much as 168%.


By the end of 2013, the stock molded another base, then broke out again. At one point, Biogen's total gain climbed to 409%.


Biogen's run was still not over. A long base from March to December 2014 produced yet another breakout. However, as the daily chart shows, Biogen went on a climax-like run that ended with an exhaustion gap-up in price on March 20  **(1)**.


At that day's high of 480.18, Biogen had rallied 717% from its October 2010 breakout. It then sold off in heavy trade for four days in a row, forming the head in the head-and-shoulders pattern.


On April 24, Biogen gapped down 6.6% and undercut its 50-day moving average in one of the highest volume days of the year **(2)**. It was another key sell signal for investors.


Over the next three months, the stock built the pattern's right shoulder. A strong rally attempt in June pulled the stock back above the key 50-day line for a short while. Biogen's second frail attempt to reclaim the 50-day moving average set up the short sale, as the stock crossed below the line for the third time since April.


Today, Biogen still trades more than 35% below its 480.18 peak.

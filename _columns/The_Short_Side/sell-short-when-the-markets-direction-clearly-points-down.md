There are several keys to boosting the odds of success when you aim to sell stocks short and capitalize on the market's downside.


One key is discipline — it's critical in your stock selection and your timing of the [short sale](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm).


Discipline keeps you focused on the stocks that have made [exceptional price runs](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/040215-746318-how-is-netflix-stock.htm) and are showing telltale signs of weakness. Discipline also prevents you from chasing a stock when its decline has become too obvious.

When IBD's Market Pulse table, found inside the daily [Big Picture column](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm), notes the current outlook as "Market in correction," you've taken a good step in the right direction to catching stocks that weaken in price.


Next, take a close look at the daily chart of the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. How are their 50-day and 200-day moving averages behaving?


If the 50- and 200-day lines (drawn in red and black, respectively, on Investors.com [chart](http://research.investors.com/ibd-charts.aspx?cht=pvc&type=daily&symbol=0NDQC)s), are sloping lower, the probability of making money on the short side goes up.


The reason is simple. A falling moving average line means that the market itself is trending toward falling prices. Since most stocks follow the market, you should see your stock see little resistance to the downside after you've sold shares short.


When the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq composite attempts to rebound back above its 200-day moving average but fails, you've gained another profitable clue that you're, as legendary trader Jesse Livermore would say, on the "right side" of the market.


Pay attention to not only the 50-day and 200-day moving averages on the daily charts, but also their rough equivalents on the weekly charts — namely, the 10-week and 40-week moving averages.


A 40-week line plots the average closing price of a stock or index over the past 40 weeks, which is more or less 200 days' worth of price action.


**Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) broke out of a late-stage double-bottom base at 56.02 in early August 2008. The base proved faulty because it showed too many wide-and-loose weekly price swings. The large-cap biotech had already staged a steady and strong run, tripling in price from an early-stage base breakout back in 2005. Giilead also rallied 470% since a breakout during the March 2003 market bottom.


The breakout produced a gain of less than 3%. Then Gilead slumped lower. It gave prudent chart readers a good opportunity to sell short.


The major stock averages were already in a serious downtrend. As the weekly chart of the S&P 500 shows, the 40-week moving average line crested at the end of 2007 1 and began falling well before Gilead attempted its fateful breakout.


From late August to early September, the stock pierced its 10-week moving average near 53.54 and triggered the 7%-8% loss rule near 52. Volume accelerated. It was time to short.


In the week ended Sept. 5, Gilead fell 9% to 47.85. A proper short sale would have handed the trader a paper gain of nearly 9%.


The time to cover came a month later, when the stock reached 41.60, good for a 25% gain. By then, the collapse of Lehman Bros. had caused a massive panic-driven sell-off across Wall Street.


If one had a little more conviction, the short could have been covered near 36 during the week ended Oct. 10, when Gilead fell 18% in the heaviest volume in two years.


Leaderboard's Cut List offers current ideas for future short sale opportunities. Like Gilead, some of the stocks feature huge prior runs in price and torpedo-like sell-offs in recent months.


A sell signal in a stock is not automatically a short-sale signal. In IBD's Leaderboard [Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/), some names were moved from the Leaders list because they issued signals for holders to take profits or to avoid a gain from reversing into a loss. But they may still be forming new bases and have yet to mark an ultimate top.

  The Short Side: Baidu Took Time Before Breaking Down

In the game of short-selling, patience is critical.

  

Never forget that. In fact, you may want to commit those last three words to memory.

  

It can take quite a lot of time for a prime short-sale opportunity to develop.

  

Once it occurs, you must act decisively.

  

One of the general rules of successful short selling is to look for a high-probability entry point five to seven months after a stock has peaked in price.

  

When a great stock peaks and heads lower, it can still rally substantially over a period of days and weeks. While some holders are selling out, others are still bullish about the company. They may try to defend the stock by buying shares and boosting the price.

  

This ongoing battle between bulls and bears eventually wears down the stock, and a tipping point is reached.

  

Sometimes a good short sale point may take longer to appear.

  

Consider **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), a tremendous market leader after the major indexes bottomed in March 2009. The stock broke out of a six-week flat base in September 2009 and vaulted 433% to its 165.96 peak nearly two years later. Then it took more than 15 months before the stock really began to break down.

  

Baidu tried to build a new base after undercutting the low of a late-stage and faulty cup in the week ended Sept. 30, 2011 **(1)**.

  

But see how the stock swiftly rebounded in a knee-jerk-like reaction **(2)**? In the week ended Oct. 7, Baidu rallied 11.5%. Then it surged 15% the next week.

  

This shows why it's dangerous to try to short when the stock is already making new lows. It's too obvious. The professionals on Wall Street know this, too.

  

Baidu built a new base. Even though technically it was now a stage-one base, it was in fact a last-gasp attempt to shine again and march to new highs.

  

As Baidu cleared a 141.58 handle buy point, notice how weekly volume was far from robust **(3)**. Another warning sign: The Relative Strength line was barely rising and far from approaching new high ground **(4)**.

  

After a six-week rebound from July to August in 2012, Baidu plunged in the week ended Aug. 24, falling 14% in the heaviest weekly volume in 2012 **(5)**.

  

At a recent IBD advanced workshop, Scott O'Neil, president of MarketSmith, likened this sort of decline to a "torpedo" that rips into the hull of a ship. The more torpedoes that a stock suffers, the more likely it's going to sink fast.

  

Notice how the stock then moved sideways for nine weeks, forming what O'Neil calls an "L pattern." Not only did Baidu fail to recoup the massive losses of that torpedo-like sell-off, its movement was capped by a 10-week moving average that began to slope lower.

  

Volume during the few up weeks in that L pattern was mostly pale **(6)**, another sign of flagging demand.

  

It became clear the market had fallen into correction mode on Oct. 10, as noted in the next day's Market Pulse inside IBD's Big Picture column. The conditions for testing the short-selling waters were ripe. Baidu entered the IBD Leaderboard Cut List on Oct. 25.

  

If one had sold shares short as soon as Baidu tripped below the 10-week moving average **(7)**, the short then could have been covered just three weeks later near 92 for a 20% profit.

  

As the chart shows, a new short sale entry may be developing.

  

Smart short sellers take their gains when the profit reaches the 20% to 25% level. If you're too greedy and wait for more, you could end up losing those gains during a fast rebound.

  

Baidu offers a few more lessons for aggressive investors who want to learn how to pick short-sale candidates.

  

One, focus on those names that were true market leaders. Demand that the stock make huge price runs of 200%, 300% or more from a proper buy point.

  

Expect that such stocks form fourth- or even fifth-stage bases during their climbs.

  

This shows the stock enjoyed heavy institutional demand. But there always comes a time when supply will smother even the staunchest of bulls.

  

In Baidu's case, the Chinese Internet star dominated — and still does — the Middle Kingdom's search engine industry.

  

Two, don't pay much attention to the recent quarters of top- and bottom-line growth. They still may be strong even as the stock is topping and starting a descent.

  

Why is that? The market always looks forward, not backward, and a company's chart often deteriorates before its fundamentals do.

  

In the past three quarters prior to Baidu's late-October drop, Baidu's earnings per share grew 83%, 81% and 72% vs. year-ago levels. Few companies can even dream of growing that fast. The average revenue increase over that time frame was 79%.

  

Baidu began falling hard the same week it announced Q3 results (with EPS up 62%, revenue up 52%).

  

Three, your chances of winning in a short trade depend a lot on the state of the market. They tend to work more often in a correction, and even better in a bear market. This point cannot be overstated. The market has a naturally bullish, or upward, bias. So the windows of opportunity for the short sellers are narrow.

  Dazzling IPO Can Eventually Become A Great Short

An IPO can capture the market's fancy and then rocket to big gains.


 


This doesn't mean that individual investors are looking at either the next **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), or the next Google (turned **Alphabet** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG))).


Sometimes the gains mean investors are looking at the next Cbeyond, a stock that dazzled the Street for about two years and then came apart, never to completely recover.


Such stocks can provide excellent gains on the way up, but they can also offer good gains if shorted at the right time.


Investors might remember Cbeyond in its glory days. The communications company debuted on the Nasdaq in November 2005 and ran up until late 2007. Trouble followed, and eventually the privately held Birch Communications bought Cbeyond in 2014.


But while the going was good, Cbeyond broke out of bases for good gains three times. Then two fourth-stage breakouts failed, and the stock racked up ugly losses.


The fourth-stage losses were no surprise to investors who study the charts. A rising stock will pause to consolidate as it advances. Breakouts from the first two consolidations have a better chance of success than those from later patterns.


After its initial public offering, Cbeyond formed a four-week base. (An IPO base can be shorter than most conventional bases.)


The breakout from the IPO base brought a gain of 11%. The next two breakouts -- from first- and second-stage patterns -- yielded gains of 77% and 38%, respectively. The stock then rose 24% from a third-stage pattern.


A disciplined investor would've played the first two bases and left the third-stage base to others.


The third-stage breakout delivered a gain on paper, but that overlooks two crucial facts. The stock corrected 8% after clearing the third-stage pattern, triggering the 8% loss-cutting rule.


An investor who re-entered when the stock retook the buy point was in for a rough ride. Cbeyond came back to the buy point several times and lost its 50-day line several times.


There's a reason rules are called "rules."


The disciplined investor found even less reason to buy into the two fourth-stage breakouts from two adjacent patterns. A breakout Oct. 1, 2007, brought a 6% gain over two sessions. The stock then began the second consolidation.


Was the failed breakout from the second consolidation the time to short the stock?


No -- the market was in a confirmed uptrend. Most stocks should not be shorted during an uptrend, even if a stock is showing weakness. An uptrending market can provide enough upward gusts to make holding a short position difficult. This was the case with Cbeyond.


The first chance to short Cbeyond came when the market went into a correction, a change in course noted in IBD on Jan. 7, 2008. The next day, shares plunged below the 10-week line in huge volume, confirming the failure of the late-stage base and the proper time to short the stock.


If a short seller made the move at the 33.02 close Jan. 8, the stock reached the 20% profit-taking level by early February.


For high-conviction short sellers who decided to hold for more profit, the stock eventually fell to 13.94 in March 2008 and to 5.39 in November 2013.

In the game of going long in the stock market, IBD's rules help you find additional entries in a hot stock after its breakout. Do this right, and you get the wonderful opportunity to compound your gains.


Can you do the same on the short side? Absolutely.


A former market leader that tips into a deep correction will show weak price action for weeks, if not months. So if you arm yourself with a set of daily and weekly charts, the right sell rules, and the discipline to cut losses quickly and take profits judiciously, then you open the door to profits in a stock that has peaked and is sliding fast.


To review, the primary short sale entry points arise when a stock, following a big price run (think 300% gain or more), shows bad action after the breakout from a late-stage base or after creating a [head and shoulders pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-short-stocks/).


What if a stock drops like a rock and never makes a solid rebound? Look for the potential formation of an [L-shape pattern](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/how-the-l-shape-pattern-can-help-you-sell-short-for-big-profits/), which is quite rare but does emerge after a very sharp decline in a matter of just a few weeks or even less.


At some point, a former leader rebounds and recoups some of its sharp losses, then stalls in an attempt to rally back above the 50-day or 10-week moving average. The stock may hit the 10-week line, then melt like a snowflake hitting a windshield. Or, the stock may rise above it for a day or two, then get yanked below it, usually in heavy turnover. Short the stock as it's falling back through the 10-week line, or as it's reversing lower.


Be sure to look at both daily and weekly charts. Sometimes a stock may never get close to its 50-day moving average, even as it's touched or crossed the 10-week line.


Take profits when you get a gain of 20%-25%. However, if your timing is absolutely right and you have conviction that the stock is poised for a long decline, you can decide to hold out for bigger gains. Settle for smaller profits if the market is choppy.


**First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)), the November 2006 IPO that made a colossal run from late 2006 to late 2007, collapsed 96% from its 317 peak to an all-time low of 11.43 in June 2012. Then it rushed higher again. The stock didn't hit all-time highs, yet it rallied 555% to 74.84 by March 2014.


![shrtsidefslr122316](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ShrtSideFSLR122316.png)A faulty cup, showing wild moves throughout the base, formed in early 2016, yielding a 72.22 buy point. First Solar broke out Feb. 25; a few weeks later, it slid below the 50-day line and offered a short-sale entry near 66, 8% below the proper entry.


First Solar dropped to as low as 59, then shuffled sideways to form a miniature version of the L-shape **(1)**. That set up a follow-on short sale on April 28, right after it reported first-quarter results. Despite solid results, Wall Street frowned on the company's outlook. The Phoenix-based solar power plant builder sank 8%, undercut the L's low, and dropped 21% in 16 days to trigger a profit-taking cover.


One could have also decided to sit.


First Solar continued to struggle. The stock rallied back above its 50-day moving average for a few days in July, then crashed again on its latest quarterly results. On Aug. 4, First Solar fell 11% **(2)**, giving traders another chance to sell short just as it crossed the 50-day line near 48.


By mid-September, the stock hit 34, down nearly 30%.

  The Short Side: To Lower Risk, Prefer High Volume

Before you decide to press the "sell short" button, verify one thing — the stock's average daily turnover.


Is it at least 800,000 shares a day on average?


If yes, good. You're already lowering the probability that market makers, hot-money funds and other professionals may try to run a stock up in price and run you out with a loss.


If no, beware the extra risk.


A stock that's priced at $50 a share and trades just 300,000 shares a day — or just $15 million in dollar volume a day — can be an easy target for market specialists. They are continually seeking to prey on stocks with an unusually high level of shares that are shorted. These traders can bag fast profits by creating a strong rally in the stock and squeezing the shorts.


Such manipulation, however, is far harder to execute when the stock is trading 2 million, 4 million shares a day or more. It will simply take a lot of ammunition to move such a stock up in price.


How do you find the average daily volume for a stock?


On Investors.com, order up a stock quote by typing in a ticker in the search box at the top-right section of the home page.


You'll get a page that shows not only the stock's latest price, volume for the day and the percentage change in volume, but also a two-column box of other statistics. Click on the right arrow at the bottom of that box, and you'll spot the "50-Day Avg. Volume" figure on the top line of the left-side column.


For example, if you get a stock quote for **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)), the average turnover shown on Investors.com is 52 million shares.


On the long side, IBD strongly recommends limiting one's buys to stocks that trade at least 400,000 shares a day. In general, stocks that trade at least 1 million shares are even more favorable.


Let's consider the stocks that have been featured as examples in this column so far. **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), highlighted in the inaugural Dec. 24 column, presented a short-sale entry in late October last year.


When it entered IBD's Leaderboard Cut List on Oct. 25, the Chinese Web search engine traded on average 5.8 million shares a day. That day, it finished the session at 114.01 a share. This means that it would have taken $661 million worth of buying and selling just to move the stock up or down 1 point.


With that kind of turnover, it's not easy — practically impossible — for one trader or one market maker to push the stock around. The stock's daily and weekly action is going to be more consistently influenced by the raw balance of supply and demand.


Let's see how other stocks that gave excellent short-sale opportunities traded.


When **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) presented a [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/122812-638723-smart-short-selling-dollar-tree-stock.htm) in early October (analyzed in the Dec. 31 article), the average daily turnover was 2.3 million shares. Less than two months later, average volume surged to 4.2 million shares when the super-discount retail chain had trouble rallying back above its 10-week line.


**VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) (featured on Jan. 28) formed an [L pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/012513-642046-vmware-stock-market-investing-virtualization-software.htm) in the summer of 2008. When the stock broke down near its sharply falling 10-week line, 2.5 million shares changed hands each day.

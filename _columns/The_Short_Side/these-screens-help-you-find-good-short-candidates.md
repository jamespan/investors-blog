  These Screens Help You Find Good Short Candidates

Two specific screens found only in Investor's Business Daily can help you home in on great candidates to sell short.


The first: The Stocks On The Move screen, updated throughout the trading day on the home page of Investors.com. This table is also published every day in the newspaper's "Making Money" section, today on Page B7.


The second: The daily IBD Timesaver Table, today on Page B13. Keep a close eye on the names that have high IBD Ratings, such as a 98 Composite, and are listed on the right column. Stocks are ranked by Composite Rating. William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, notes that he reads this column to identify unusual weakness among the market's top-performing stocks.


When a former big winner slides fast after it's peaked, the stock is usually dripping in big trading volume. What exactly is "big trading volume?" IBD compares a stock's volume for the day with its average over the past 50 sessions. If the day's volume is 50%, 100%, 200% or more than the average, it's practically a sure sign that a herd of institutional investors stampeded out of the stock, probably selling enough shares to fill a stagecoach.


Heavy volume on the downside signals an inflection point. Maybe a stock has already made a huge gain, so demand for shares is waning. When the sellers really take hold, short-sale opportunities pop up, including the [failed late-stage breakout](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/080213-666265-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) and the [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/040513-650844-how-to-sell-short-in-the-market.htm).


(Please read past articles from this column, which began in December and is currently being published on the first Monday or Tuesday of each month, to know how to identify the correct time to sell.)


Not all of the stocks that show up on these two screens are worthy of shorting. A supersized run prior to the stock's peak is critical.


Do not target thinly traded names. If the daily average volume is at least 800,000 shares a day, the more likely you'll have found a good stock to short, and the less likely you'll be shaken out by excessive stock volatility.


Let's study how **BlackBerry** ([BBRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBRY)) behaved when its shares tried to clear a fourth-stage base during the eve of the 2008 bear market.


On June 17, 2008, the highly successful smartphone maker, previously known as Research in Motion, broke out of a faulty late-stage base-on-base structure at 144.60. It quickly reversed. On June 26, the stock dropped 13% in the heaviest volume in months. **(1)**


This was the ideal short sale entry point. During that day, BlackBerry traded as high as 128.98 and as low as 123. See how it gapped down below its 50-day moving average? The 50-day line had acted as an area of buying support just a couple of weeks before.


BlackBerry made the next day's Nasdaq Stocks On The Move table. It was also featured in a markets column that's since evolved into Smart Table Review. Investors could have shorted the stock on June 26 or the next day near 120-121, then covered the short position a mere three weeks later for a gain of 20% to 25%.


In recent weeks, few big winners are showing up on the Stocks On The Move or IBD Timesaver Table and deserve close monitoring for a potential short sale.

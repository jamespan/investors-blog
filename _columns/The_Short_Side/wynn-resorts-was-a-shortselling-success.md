  Late-Stage Base Failure Supplies Short-Sale Setup

The inaugural column of "The Short Side" delved into the head-and-shoulders pattern, one of two major chart bases you need to know to sell former market winners short with success.


The other major setup is a late-stage base breakout failure.


First, let's define the base.


It's nothing more than a period of time in which a great stock takes a break after rising 20% or more from a prior entry point. (In a first-stage base, the prior uptrend must be 30% or more.)


In general, the greater the market leader, the greater number of bases it forms during its long run.


**Look For Many Bases**


No stock is immune to gravity. So when you see a stock form a third, fourth or fifth base, you know that the stock has already risen a lot. Such a stock is more vulnerable to a market top. Fewer eager buyers are around. Savvy fund managers may wait for a last gasp to new highs to occur and sell into strength. The balance of power tips to the sellers.


When a stock's breakout fails, you cannot expect the stock to gain 20%. Rather, you might expect the stock to fall 8% quickly. When this happens, it's time to sell shares short.


In a late-stage breakout failure, the entry may arrive just days after the stock breaks out. In other words, you really need to be on your toes, like a tennis player ready to smack his opponent's big serve back for a return winner.


You must also be willing to possess a contrarian mind.


When a great stock breaks out and fails, bad headlines may be absent. The latest quarterly growth in sales and earnings are probably superb. Most analysts still are screaming "Buy."


**They Fall Fast And Early**


"It is a very difficult one to catch. A lot of good ones break down early and the market indexes haven't necessarily turned down convincingly," Scott O'Neil, president of MarketSmith, told IBD. "That's my experience during the fourth quarter of 2012."


Also know this: The best growth stocks also fall faster than the market when the major averages are under heavy distribution and are rolling over.


IBD research shows that once a big leader has peaked, the average decline is 72%. Imagine a stock that peaks at 100 and is heading lower. It could fall to 28 before the selling finally abates.


**How The Breakout Fails**


In 2007, **Wynn Resorts** ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)) capped a tremendous price run with a fault-riddled late-stage base. It came public in October 2002. After a base count reset in 2005, the stock catapulted out of bases in January 2006, November 2006 and August 2007. These bases formed during pleasant market conditions.


When the operator of the Wynn and Encore luxury resorts in Las Vegas and Macau formed its flat base in October 2007, it had already soared 841% from its first true base built in 2003.


While the base's decline was limited to 15%, notice how it was just four weeks long 1. This was a key flaw. A proper flat base must be at least five weeks or more.


The first week of the base, a down week, showed intense volume. That's normal. But the base didn't show any up weeks in big trade. Demand for shares was waning.


Wynn broke out on Oct. 29, clearing a 169.48 entry; volume was 32% above average (please see a daily chart on MarketSmith). The stock fell the next eight sessions. In the first two days down, volume accelerated.


On Nov. 1, Wynn fell another 4% and triggered the 8% loss rule. It was time to short. That day, Wynn also closed below its 10-day moving average, signaling a subtle shift in momentum.


Also on Nov. 1, the Nasdaq dived 2.3% in higher volume, a clear distribution day. The day before, the composite index ran to a high of 2861.51. But it had also chalked up at least five days of professional selling over a 15-session stretch from Oct. 11.


One could have covered the short position five weeks later, when the stock traded near 124, and bagged a 25% profit.


Today, leading stocks that have formed at least three bases since the 2009 market bottom include **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **TransDigm** ([TDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDG)) and **Watson Pharmaceuticals** ([WPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WPI)).


Watson has engineered a superb run since falling as low as 20.17 in October 2008. But its recent breakout attempt past 90 went nowhere fast.


On Jan. 2, TransDigm bolted out of a choppy base. The stock filled its gap. Its Accumulation-Distribution Rating is weak.


Lululemon has built at least three bases since it jumped out of a long consolidation in the week ended March 5, 2010. On Jan. 2, the stock reversed for a 3% loss despite big gains by the major indexes. The maker of premium-priced yogawear and sports apparel, still shows strong fundamentals.

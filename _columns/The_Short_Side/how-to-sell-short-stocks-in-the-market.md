IBD chatted with Scott O'Neil, president of MarketSmith, on April 9 to discuss the current market action and his perspective on the challenge of successful short-selling.


As if to emphasize the enormity of the challenge, the next day, the market acted in diametric opposition to short-sellers.


The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.8% as volume bulged. The S&P 500 said sayonara to its previous all-time peak of 1576 as it raced 1.2% higher. In the next day's IBD, The Big Picture's Market Pulse table revealed a change in the current outlook to "Uptrend resumes."


Every short-seller must know that right off the bat, the deck is almost always stacked against them. Why? The market has a natural upward bias. So one's timing must be perfect.


**IBD:** Do you personally find short-selling more difficult than going long in the stock market?


**O'Neil:** Heck, yeah. It's substantially more difficult, and the reason is, unless you're lucky and absolutely right there, Johnny on the spot, the stock breaking down and on big volume, and you catch it as it's falling, there's nothing going to stop it . .. I almost never catch them that way.


It's very hard. I have a couple (of winners like that), but really, you're entering, based on a chart pattern, and it's looking like it's going to break, but it hasn't; it's trying to break, and so you have to give it that benefit of the doubt.


It seems like I have to give shorts more time to develop than a long stock that starts to break out and go. You get that confirmation fairly quickly. On the short side, they leave me kind of hanging and once you're in this mode where it has not confirmed yet, then you start second-guessing yourself; you're concerned about a news announcement, or something like that.


So it's much harder to short, and that's why unless someone is really experienced, if they want to do it, do it very small. (It's) not to make money, (just) try to make it work. Try to make the mechanics work. Stay small for several cycles, just chip away at it, see what works and what doesn't. Make your mistakes inexpensively.


**IBD:** What are you doing in your portfolio today?


**O'Neil:** I have initiated some short positions. It's that feeling process that you were talking about (in the March 8 Short Side [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/040513-650844-how-to-sell-short-in-the-market.htm)). You might have some longs on, but the market seems like it might get into some trouble.


There was a good point made in yesterday's (April 8) paper talking about the last three or four weeks that we've had a lot of up days in low volume, down days in higher volume.


When you just look at the index chart — which I agree with you, you want to look at the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, that's what I do — I'm not sure; it doesn't inspire confidence. Now, maybe it works. We're in this transition, so it isn't like you go aggressive one way or the other, but you're kind of feeling. So you put a few shorts out, and see if they catch.


**IBD:** To get into the short positions, which charts were you using more: the daily or the weekly? Or were you using them in equal stride?


**O'Neil:** That's an interesting question, because some people think you can do kind of the same thing on the long side and the short side. There are subtle nuances that the professionals and more serious investors would note. On the long side, I always go the weekly chart first, then use the daily of course for that exact pivot or entry to add (shares).


On the short side, I also use the weekly first, because it gives you that longer-term perspective, or at least that longer time perspective. The patterns are much more recognizable. You can see a stock continually weakening. Or the price action looks a little weak but the RS Rating is terrible, somewhere in the 20 or 30 range. Then I go to the daily, but on the daily chart, I'm laser-focused on that entry point.


Take today, with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). I've shorted it three times (in recent times). Take a little bit, cover. Nothing fantastic. On the weekly, Apple looks fantastic to my eye. But on the daily, it's not exactly right, so I decided to pass on it for some others. The precision on entry is very important, and you have to do it on the daily.


**IBD:** How can MarketSmith assist you in short-selling?


**O'Neil:** We have a list in the Growth 250 (called) "Stocks breaking down." The screens that go into that are fairly comprehensive, as are the 30 screens for the long side. It looks at ideas from multiple angles, and that's my "go to" list.

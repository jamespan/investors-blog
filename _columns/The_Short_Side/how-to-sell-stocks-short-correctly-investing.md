  The Short Side: Sell When The Market Is Diving

IBD readers know that the right time to buy stocks is when the market is in a clear uptrend.


So is the inverse true? Should you sell shares short only when the market is in a clear correction?


Yes. And sometimes no.


When a correction becomes a bear market — a 20% or greater decline or from the recent high — more stocks will definitely fall than rise. The 2008-09 bear mauling is the most recent example. So the probability of a winning short-sale trade is naturally higher.


So when could you sell shares short even if the market is not in a correction?


If a stock meets the following three conditions, you'll likely improve your chances of making money on the short side.


One, the stock made gains of at least 200%, 300% or more from a proper base breakout over a meaningful period of time and has shown clear topping signs.


Two, the company is experiencing slowing bottom-line growth, or may be showing signs of growth deceleration.


Three, the stock's industry group and its peers are falling by the wayside.


Even in a bull market, money flows from sector to sector to sector. The market is like a kitchen stove-top: One area of the market may be heating up while another area may be cooling.


**Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)), featured in last week's [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/122812-638723-smart-short-selling-dollar-tree-stock.htm), is a good example of a stock that topped and furnished shorting opportunities even as the major indexes sealed double-digit gains in 2012.


Dollar Tree wasn't alone.


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)), **Green Mountain Coffee Roasters** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) and **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) had a blue year in 2012, despite healthy double-digit gains by the major averages.


Yet it cannot be overemphasized how crucial it is to boost one's chances of success on the short side by choosing those moments when the market and the industry group are weak.


**Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) had a most phenomenal run in the 1990s since its October 1990 breakout. But after the Internet bubble popped in March 2000, everything changed for the techs.


Just as Cisco peaked in early September 2000, the market saw a flare-up in intense professional selling. The S&P 500 suffered five distribution days in just 10 trading sessions from Aug. 29 to Sept. 12 that year. Then the market really began to cave.


Meanwhile, Cisco had formed a head-and-shoulders pattern. Notice how the right shoulder, formed as the mega-cap tech bobbed up and down through its 10-week moving average, was a bit lower than its left shoulder.


If you tried to short too early, like when Cisco dropped 11% in the week ended May 19, you might have gotten steamrolled by the market makers and bargain hunters 1. Wait for the head and shoulders to form.


The time to short came in the weeks ended Sept. 8 and 15 2 , five months after Cisco topped. Volume accelerated to the downside. The stock could not muster another rally back through the 10-week line. At the time, Cisco was still growing at a rapid rate, and was No. 1 in the computer networking field. Yet additional short-sale points emerged in late 2000 and early 2001 3.

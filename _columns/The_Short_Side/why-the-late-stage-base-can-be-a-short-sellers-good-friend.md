In the short selling game, the late-stage base breakout is similar to the moment a prospector is a few scrapes away from unearthing gold.


Just like the most successful 49ers during the mid-19th century California gold rush, you have to be like the early bird. And you must use charts correctly.


Leading stocks form a series of bases, or periods of temporary declines or sideways price movement, as they embark on a long run of price gains and new highs. In the early bases, most top-performing stocks tend to show controlled, tight price action within the base. The size of the declines are limited. Volume tends to sway higher during up weeks in price, not down.


But as a stock tires, its action becomes more prone to big swings, sharper declines, and erratic price action.


When you spot such action, you might have stumbled upon a third or fourth base, or perhaps even a fifth. Such late-stage bases tend to show flaws. The stock appears to careen up and down in price, a bad sign. The base itself may be too narrow in length. And the base may be forming while the stock market itself shows signs of topping.


Even amid these flaws, some stocks will still break out past a properly defined buy point. If the breakout stumbles, and the stock stalls, keep watching. A drop of 7%-8% below that pivot point is your entry as a short seller. In other words, if the stock broke out at 100, the prime short-sale entry is at 92-93.


As always, never let losses in a short position run free. Accept the loss and cover the position if the stock rises 7%-8% above your short-sale price.


**Oracle** ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) formed no fewer than three bases during an outstanding price run of more than 350% to a split-adjusted high of 45.


It all began on with a breakout from a long, deep cup with handle on Sept. 3, 1999. For the business and database software king from Silicon Valley peaked at 45, this base was first stage. A stock has to rally at least 20% from the proper buy point before you can count a new stage.


After the September breakout, Oracle gained less than 18%, then pulled back in sideways fashion for nearly seven weeks. The new base was part of the prior long base, hence this "base on base" pattern still counts as stage one (see the accompanying chart).


After former Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan and the U.S. central bank made it clear there would be no hikes in interest rates until at least after Jan. 1, 2000 -- a source of anxiety for investors at the time because of the Y2K scare that computers would somehow reset back to 1900, not 2000 -- the market took off. So did Oracle.


The stock carved a sloppy seven-week consolidation in early 2000, but investors were still nuts about tech stocks. A breakout in the week ended Feb. 25, 2000, yielded a 45% gain. But the third base, while not super late stage, was horrible in many respects: wild weekly action; numerous down weeks in price in heavy volume; and a 19% drop within the cup base's handle, far more than the 8%-12% decline typically seen in good bases.


On top of that, Oracle had just split shares 2-for-1 in January. That followed three separate 3-for-2 splits stretching over the prior four years. Too many splits reflect over-exuberance and signal a top is near as the supply of shares floods the market.


In Oracle's case, a breakout past 87.72 on Aug. 28 (or 43.86 following another 2-for-1 split in October 2000) showed feeble action. The big cap rose 6% in five sessions, but that was it. After topping, the stock fell 7% below the 43.86 split-adjusted price in heavy trading near 40.79 on Sept. 11. That was the time to short.


On Sept. 13, Oracle undercut its 50-day moving average. The following two-day rebound lacked fortitude, and shares continued to slump. A short seller could have covered the position near 32 just a few weeks later for a gain of more than 20%.

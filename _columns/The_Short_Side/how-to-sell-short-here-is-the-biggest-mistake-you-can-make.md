When it comes to selling hot stocks short, it's worth taking this small piece of advice: Don't strive for perfection.


Put another way, don't try to sell at the very top.


Human brains would logically agree that in the game of short selling, it's best to sell high and buy back low. But given the market's upward bias, selling a big winner short just as it's rallying to a new all-time high can be extremely hazardous. Why? What may seem at the time to be the stock's peak is often not the case.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SHRTsideAAOI073117.jpg)Always remember that the stock market is not a fully rational system. While there may be program trades and algorithmic strategies, the market is still prone to the herd and the emotions of the many. Even if your logic that a stock is priced too far above its "fair value," your opinion won't necessarily stop the irrationality of investor behavior.


Let's take one of the top performers in the stock market over the past 12 months, **Applied Optoelectronics** ([AAOI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAOI)). On Jan. 12, the IBD 50 name broke out of a seven-week base that was second stage **(1)**. The buy point was 27.38. (Please see a long-term weekly chart in [MarketSmith](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012GE5) to see the entire second-stage base.) In just over seven months' time, shares have rushed more than 277% higher. Trying to short the stock at some of its recent peaks would have triggered big losses.


For this reason, always stay disciplined and always have patience. Here are some key steps.


One, as espoused numerous times in [The Short Side column](https://www.investors.com/short-selling/), don't try to be creative. Form your watch list among those companies that have rallied a very large percentage in price, then show signs of a sharp decline in the works. After a stock makes a new high, it might reverse lower in a big way, often in tremendous turnover. Weeks or months later, a late-stage base breakout failure or a head-and-shoulders pattern may form.


The late-stage base failure can initiate a short-sell entry soon after the breakout fails, sometimes in just days. The head and shoulders usually takes five to seven months to form.


Two, study the group strength of your short-sale candidates. Are you seeing weakness among its industry leaders? Is the sector weakening? And, is the market showing signs of choppy action, erratic movement, or intense selling? These factors may help you make money on the short side.


Three, if you have missed those early short-sale opportunities, don't quit. You might spot another chance to sell short, including failed tests of resistance at a falling 10-week moving average.


Applied Optoelectronics, the small-cap tech, did in fact present a timely short-sale entry as it formed a faulty V-shaped base in March, then cleared the 56.24 entry **(2)**. When the Sugar Land, Texas, firm reversed and fell 7% below that buy point to 52.30, an intrepid short seller could have sold short — assuming you were able to borrow shares from your broker. The stock's float is just 17 million shares. Applied dropped to as low as 40.28 just 12 sessions after the breakout, a perfect time to cover that short for a very nice gain, as much as 29%.


That 40.28 low turned out to help shape the bottom of the stock's new base. What if you had attempted to short as Applied cleared its new cup **(3)**? Disaster.


And what if you tried to sell short again in July as it rocketed off its rising 50-day moving average and catapulted into new high ground **(4)**? Disaster, again. And glee for the longs.

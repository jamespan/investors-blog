Stock trading is a mental game. So excellence on the short side of the market depends as much as the long side on a healthy mentality. What do stock market masters say about the subject?


One can learn from William O'Neil's personal trading career. Twenty-two years before he founded Investor's Business Daily in 1984, O'Neil made great strides as a stockbroker.


In 1962, when most brokers felt bullish about stocks, the Oklahoma native and Southern Methodist University grad felt keenly bearish. So by April 1, O'Neil was 100% out of the market.


Then he went short.

"By the end of 1962, I showed a net profit when almost everyone around me was down substantially in one of the worst stock market breaks of the 1950s and 1960s," O'Neil wrote in the foreword of the IBD Short Selling [Home Study Program](https://www.investors.com/products/ibd-home-study-program/beginning-strategies-for-successful-investing/?src=A011BMT&nav=IBDUHomestudy) . "It was a year later that I bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and started my own firm."


**First Key: Be Humble**


If you meet O'Neil, you immediately get the impression that not only is he wise about the stock market, but he is humble too.


Humility is one of the mental features that a trader must have to succeed in the short-selling game. O'Neil never insists on being right on every trade. He knows and accepts that he will make mistakes, and he acts accordingly by exiting bad trades swiftly.


O'Neil himself liked to say this about market players: There are the quick, and there are the dead.


That's one thing you must do if you want to win in the short-selling game: After you sell a stock short, if it goes up in price, accept the trading mistake fast. Cut your loss at 7% or 8% above your short-sale price. Take losses even more quickly when it's obvious that the stock's rise is powerful and there is strong volume behind the trading action.


If you can limit your loss at 7% on each bad trade, then you can be wrong three out of every four times and still break even with a fourth trade that nets you a 20%-25% profit.


Being humble, then, means controlling your emotions. Yet unlike computers, human beings often have a tough time doing it.


What are some other healthy mental qualities worth keeping throughout your trading life?


**Patience, Patience, Patience**


Develop this quality. Short selling isn't a video game in which you have unlimited bullets or laser power. You must pick your spots with extreme care.


It would have been tempting to sell shares of **Keurig Green Mountain** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) short earlier this year â€” for instance, when it got clobbered during the week ending March 27 and fell 8%. However, the stock's weakness was too obvious that week. The chart showed that it was not at a proper short-sale entry.


Keurig rallied mildly over the next four weeks, but eventually it moved sideways. During that period, IBD Leaderboard noted that a new short entry could emerge near 120.


From April 4 through May 27, IBD's Market Pulse showed the current outlook as "Market in correction." The right time to strike on Keurig came on a sharp drop in heavy trade on May 4. By Aug. 4, Keurig fell from the 111.62 May 4 close to 52.67.


**Don't Follow The Crowd**


That's the lesson that O'Neil taught in his 1962 big score. You must be willing to think as a contrarian.


The short-sale entry points that IBD teaches in this [column](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm) also feature contrarian thinking.


In the head-and-shoulders pattern, the short-sale entry does not emerge when a stock is plunging to new lows and when the stock's weakness is obvious to all. It arrives only after the stock looks like it's acting bullishly, making rallies up through the 10-week moving average or nearly up to it, typically in light volume, and then rolls over in heavier turnover. That's the time to strike.


**Have Real Conviction**


To be successful in any field, you generally must know a lot about that field. Common sense, right? It pays off in short selling, too.


It's possible that you'll have success in selling short a stock in which you made a lot of profit on the upside. Why? You've observed the stock's behavior intensively. The way that the stock reacts to news is familiar to you. Such knowledge helps a lot when the stock has topped and is ready for a long toboggan ride down.


**Practice Iron Discipline**


This is all about following a sound set of rules all the time. One of IBD's tenets: Follow the market's underlying trend.


The accompanying weekly chart of the S&P 500 peaking in June 2008 shows how market leaders of all stripes fell as the subprime debt market meltdown caused a widespread sell-off.

IBD's Leaderboard product, launched in July 2011, has served many readers in improving their stock selection and market timing on the long side. It has also helped traders profit on the downside.


How? The Cut List feature not only raises a red flag on stock market leaders that are showing troubling action. The list is also a useful place to get ideas for potential short-sale candidates.


**Be On The Right Side**


A big winner eventually peaks and rolls over. It can take time before this actually happens. Stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Google** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) have shown that a superior price run can go on for years.


But before a tired market leader starts treading a path of 52-week or multiyear lows, it may trace a key chart pattern that provides timely entries for short sellers.


Looking for the head-and-shoulders pattern or the immediate failure of a late-stage breakout takes time and practice. Truly spotting a perfect chart pattern — on the long or short side — to anticipate its next likely direction can be devilishly tricky.


So, reading and rereading past columns in The Short Side [archive](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm), as well as paying attention to the companies that get featured in the Cut List, can greatly help a short seller become more savvy in picking out a stock's peak and inevitable decline.


In other cases, the Cut List will highlight a previously highly rated stock that has broken down very badly and then makes timid recovery attempts. The stock tries to lift back above the key 10-week moving average, then gets beaten down. Or, a stock builds what MarketSmith President Scott O'Neil coined the "L pattern," in which it trades in a narrow price range for weeks or months before making another leg down.


**Nu Skin Enterprises** ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)) made a brilliant run during the market's roaring 2013. It joined Leaderboard on June 27, 2013 1. Five trading days later, the stock began its vault to new highs. By December, it stormed 120% higher. But at the end of that month, the stock also made new highs in light trade — an early sell signal.


Another key sell signal arrived Jan. 15 this year, when Nu Skin fell 16% 2 and sliced right through the 10-week moving average in boisterous trade. Nu Skin got sent from the Leaderboard to the Cut List after the market close Jan. 15 on news that the Chinese government was investigating its marketing practices.


Its presence on the Cut List gave a clue to readers that Nu Skin could emerge into a short play. That in fact happened on May 6, when the stock broke below its 50-day moving average in heavy trade, closing at 81.38.


**Nu Skin's L-Pattern Entry**


On July 8, the stock triggered a new short-sell signal by falling 2% and breaching the 71.25 low of its tight trading range over the prior six weeks. Through Friday, Nu Skin has produced gains of 38% and 21% for those who shorted at 81.38 and 71.25, respectively. When a short-sale profit reaches 20% to 25%, it's time to cover at least part of the position.


Another great source of ideas is MarketSmith's Growth 250 [list](http://www.marketsmith.com/) — in particular, the stocks that make the "Breaking Down" list. Nearly 60 stocks inhabit the list today.

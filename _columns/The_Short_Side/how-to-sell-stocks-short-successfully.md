  The Short Side: Avoid Stocks With Large Dividends

When you sell a stock short, you have a choice: Target stocks that pay a regular cash dividend, or companies that do not.


Prefer the latter.


Selling shares short is risky enough. Why add the unnecessary burden of having to pay a dividend to the owner of the shares you borrowed?


If you have sold shares short and hold them for weeks, or even days, you may be forced to pay the dividend that's normally issued by the company.


Brokerages routinely pull funds out of a short seller's account on or near the dividend recording or settlement date. That's why it's smart to check a company's website and see if the company pays quarterly, semi-annual, or yearly dividends. If so, see when the next dividend record date is likely to occur.


**TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)) holds a lottery against clients who had active margin debits to determine who must make a substitute payment vs. a potentially qualified dividend from the issuer itself.


A day after the record date, Ameritrade withdraws cash from the selected short sellers' accounts to fund the payout.


"A house margin call can be generated if the size of the dividend is greater than the equity in the account, which can be the real risk," Lori Havens, a spokesperson for TD Ameritrade, told IBD via email.


Special one-time dividends can further complicate the game.


As noted in a Nov. 28 IBD article, 173 companies had announced special payouts in the month of November alone, according to research by S&P Dow Jones Indices. That was up from 54 firms in October.


In some cases, the special dividend can be quite beefy. On Nov. 19, gun maker **Sturm Ruger** ([RGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGR)) declared a special cash payout of $4.50 a share, payable Dec. 21 to shareholders of record Dec. 7. The stock soared 22% over the next seven sessions 1.


"We remain committed to our new product development strategy and will continue to seek accretive acquisition opportunities and prudently expand our manufacturing capacity," Ruger CEO Michael Fifer said in a statement announcing the special dividend.


**Check For Availability**


Another issue worth checking before shorting a stock: Does your broker have shares that you can borrow right away?


Before attempting a trade, it's smart to call and check.


**Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) typically has 18,000 stocks available for loan, Erin Montgomery, a spokesperson at the discount brokerage pioneer, told IBD.


"Stocks that are easy to borrow come at no cost to the client, as the cost to borrow them is very low," Montgomery said via email. "Stocks that are harder to find and are in higher demand are costlier to borrow. If the client chooses to proceed, this cost is then passed on to the client."


This is another good reason why it pays to focus on highly liquid shares of companies that had big price runs in the past but have triggered key sell signals. As noted in the Feb. 4 Short Side [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/020113-642912-analyze-daily-stock-volume-before-selling-short.htm), focus on stocks with an average daily trading volume of at least 800,000 shares a day.


A million shares or 2 million shares? Even better.

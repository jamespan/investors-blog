  The Short Side: Aim At Big Winners That Top

To sell short with success, cast an eagle eye on those stocks that have enjoyed the most success â€” on the way up, that is.


What if you avoid the biggest winners, and instead take aim at mediocre or slow-and-steady gainers? Your gains on the downside are also likely to be mediocre.


Some stocks move sideways for months, if not years. They may be large in market value or a small-cap; volume may be gargantuan or puny. It doesn't matter. You might eventually squeeze out a nice double-digit gain, but it could take a long time. The stock may become a barrier between you and a better short trade.


Instead, find a stock that shines brightly like a star opera diva, not a stagehand who wears black clothing and moves sets around during scene changes. Like a diva, a great stock attracts the most hearts and minds. At some point, the stock will fail to deliver. Top- and bottom-line growth decelerates. Its products or services lose market share to upstart rivals.


In the stock market, few funds ready to buy more shares appear. That's when a former star is primed for a big fall. When a stock has become a regular fixture in the business media, many of the top fund managers will have already amassed lots of shares. They are then deciding when to exit and lock in profits.


If you're a savvy mutual fund and your shares in the stock have climbed 400% or 600% or more in value, wouldn't you start thinking about when to sell? Of course.


Never try to pick the exact top. Learn the head-and-shoulders [pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm). You can also gain from studying charts of other former big winners that fell fast right after trying to rise out of late-stage bases.


When the demand-vs.-supply dynamic has shifted to the latter, these stocks will struggle to rise a few points. They appear to slide more quickly as volume picks up.


Once you've made a great short sale, get ready to cover the position quickly and bag that 20% to 25% profit. Maybe the stock falls even more than that, tempting you to hold out for a bigger gain. That's fine, but never get too greedy. Your goal is to always keep a smart win-to-loss ratio of 3-to-1. Strive for gains of 20% to 25%, and cut your losses at 7% to 8%. Why? You can be wrong three out of four times and still finish break-even.


**Ocwen Financial** ([OCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OCN)) rose 2,623% from its 2008 low of 2.21 to a 60.18 high. In September 2013, it built a faulty late-stage cup base that was just four weeks long. The breakout past 58.34 1 fizzled in a week.


The mortgage loan servicing firm did not drop 25% right away, yet it rebounded in lighter volume than during the two-week sell-off. Tight action in December was intriguing 2, but Ocwen did not break out.


The new base was asymmetrical. Ocwen's RS line faded lower. A short-sale signal arrived in the week ended Jan. 17. The stock sank below the 10-week moving average at 54.69 in the heaviest volume in 10 weeks. One could have covered three weeks later for a 25% gain.


At the proper entry point, fundamentals were still good. But earnings-per-share growth had decelerated fast for several quarters, from 488% to 121% to 66% to 19% in Q3 2013.

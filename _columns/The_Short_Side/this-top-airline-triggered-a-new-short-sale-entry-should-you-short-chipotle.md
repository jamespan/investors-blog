**Alaska Air** ([ALK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALK)) fell sharply on Wednesday following Q3 results and triggered a follow-on short-sale entry point as shares crossed back below the 50-day moving average at 76.93 in heavy turnover.



Make sure to keep losses in all short-sale trades small because the market remains in a confirmed uptrend. In the past week, however, the Nasdaq's distribution-day count rose to four by Monday, as noted in [The Big Picture column](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).


Short sellers should also not sell a stock extended in price. In the case of Alaska, the prime entry was at 76.93; it should not be shorted below 73.27. That means the stock already is too low to short, but watch in case it goes back into the short-sale price area.


The leading airline reported Wednesday a 2% rise in third-quarter profit to $2.24 a share, a penny below the consensus view. Revenue jumped 35% to $2.12 billion, helped in large part by its acquisition of Virgin America, which it completed in December. Net margin fell 430 basis points to 13.1%. Alaska paid a quarterly dividend of 30 cents a share in the third quarter.


Alaska has been a huge winner since the market bottomed in 2009. Since clearing a base Dec. 1, 2009, near 30 (before a pair of 2-1 splits in 2012 and 2014), the stock has vaulted more than 1,200%.


But after peaking in March 3 this year at 101.43, Alaska slipped beneath its 50-day moving average and tried to form a new base over four months. The stock failed to rally back above the 50-day line in late March and in late April. Such action is similar to what you would see in a [head-and-shoulders pattern](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/how-to-spot-the-head-and-shoulders-short-sale-pattern/), one of two key chart patterns for short selling after a big leader has topped.


On June 1, Alaska's rebound strengthened, and shares rose significantly above the 50-day moving average. Yet the stock failed to break out of that base. Instead, the stock went on a nine-week slide. The midcap play triggered a primary short-sale signal by crossing back below the 50-day moving average near 89 on July 21. It soon lost support at the longer-term 200-day moving average too.



As seen in a weekly chart, Alaska cut below its 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to the 200-day line on a daily chart) in heavy volume during the week ended July 28. Since then, the 40-week line flattened and has begun to slope lower.


One could have covered the short sale in August as the gain reached 20%.


Alaska rallied vigorously for three weeks starting in late September, reclaiming its 50-day moving average in the process. But a dive back below the 50-day line indicates that institutions are still eager to sell hard.


The airline group has been losing more altitude; it has fallen to No. 129 out of 197 industry groups, down from No. 95 six weeks ago.


None of the 21 members in the industry group holds a Composite Rating of 80 or higher.

Meanwhile, **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) dived more than 15% on Wednesday after reporting Q3 adjusted earnings per share that missed the consensus view by 10% and sales growth of just 9%, down from increases of 28% and 17% in the prior two quarters.


Chipotle also triggered a short-sale entry by falling back below the 50-day line, which is near 312. At 275, the stock is already extended past the ideal short-sale entry.


Given the gap down in price, if the stock continues to show weakness, one may consider selling shares short as close as possible to Wednesday's opening price of 283.04.


However, shares are also more than 44% below a 52-week high, so the chances of institutions coming in to support the stock are typically higher. All that makes this short entry riskier.

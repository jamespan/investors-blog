  The Short Side: Late-Stage Breakout Sets Up Key Entry

When the market has enjoyed a strong uptrend for some time, the best stocks rocket to new highs, form a base, then repeat step one.


Like a rocket, however, these stocks eventually run out of fuel. Demand for shares cools off; they cannot be profit-building machines forever.


If you want to sell stocks short, use this Newtonian-like law of the market to your advantage.


Near a great stock's peak, it might form a third-, fourth- or even fifth-stage base and have just enough energy to rise out of that base. It might scratch out an all-time high. But late-stage bases tend to feature few strong buyers. Savvy institutions sell into such strength, unloading thousands or millions of shares at high prices.


This sudden new supply of shares can cause a stock to stop its rally and fall sharply â€” fast.


The late-stage base breakout is one of two primary chart patterns for short sellers. (See the archives of this feature at Investors.com to get more detail.)


First: Know how to identify and count bases. If you are brand-new to IBD, you need to learn the cup with handle, flat base, double bottom and other critical patterns. Use [Investor's Corner](http://education.investors.com/investors-corner.htm) and [IBD University](http://education.investors.com/) at Investors.com to bulk up your knowledge.


Begin counting bases when you find a stock that has broken out of a good base to 52-week or all-time highs. That's a first-stage base. If the stock rises 20% or more from the base's proper buy point, it is poised to correct and start a second-stage base. A base-on-base pattern is just one base, not two.


The right moment to begin shorting? A stock will reverse lower and fall below its buy point. While doing so, it may cut through its 50-day moving average (or 10-week line on a weekly chart). Volume should accelerate, meaning that fund managers want to get out of the stock and are dumping shares with gusto.


The smart short seller doesn't argue with such action, but goes along with the ride.


Take profits when the stock falls 20% to 25% below the ideal short-sale entry. What if the stock doesn't crash, but bounces higher? Cover the stock and take no more than a 7% to 8% loss to ensure you can battle another day.


After **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) broke out of a first-stage double-bottom base in October 2011, it roared 31% higher in just seven weeks, then formed a second-stage seven-week cup. By March of this year, the expert in computer network management tools had completed a long fourth-stage base.


The breakout in the week ended March 8 lasted two weeks. As the stock fell below a 57.87 entry point, it also slumped below the 10-week line in accelerating trade. **(1)** This was the right time to sell short. Just four weeks later, SolarWinds dropped as low as 43.21, **(2)** giving traders a chance to cover the position for a 20%-to-25% profit. At the breakout, average daily volume was 630,000 shares, a tad less than the 800,000-share ideal minimum. However, average daily dollar volume of $36 million was adequate.

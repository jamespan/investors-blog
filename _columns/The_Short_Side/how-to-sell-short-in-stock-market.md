If you want to sell shares short with success, go for the best stocks â€” of course, after they've topped.


What does IBD mean by "best"?


They score the largest gains after breaking out of a series of proper bases. These winners tend to rack up gains of 200%, 300% or more before they finally top.


Did you see a 500% or 1,000% gain in a former market leader? Put the ticker on a watch list. You're fishing in waters where big fish, the likes of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and **BlackBerry** ([BBRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBRY)) once swam.


What if you instead aim at gains among mediocre winners?


You can still be successful, if your timing and the market conditions are right. But your gains are likely to be mediocre as well. Remember that well-worn cliche: The taller they are, the harder they fall. Or think this way: If you want to ski down a hill fast, you need to climb a big mountain.


Market research also points out the logic of shorting former big winners. As today's Investor's Corner (on Page B7) points out, the leading growth stocks tend to fall 1.5 to 2.5 times the size of the major indexes' decline when the market goes into a correction.


So if the market falls 10% from its latest high, expect the growth leaders to fall 15% to 25% or even more. Fear is a powerful human emotion, so these slides can take place fast. That's ideal for the short seller. You don't want to be in the market too long.


**Qualcomm** ([QCOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOM)) was a dandy of a stock during the go-go 1990s. As the monthly chart shows, the stock made huge gains after breaking out of a deep cup with handle in early January 1999 at 60.10. (The adjacent monthly chart is adjusted for stock splits.) By year's end, the wireless chip expert rallied more than 2,300%.


No wonder the stock had such a rough time after the stock market peaked in March 2000. The stock tried to carve a cup base, but it was simply too deep. By the end of 2000, Qualcomm resumed a long trend of lower highs and lower lows. In 2001 and 2002, there were several appropriate areas in which one could have sold short and pocketed nice gains.


Now, contrast that with the stock's recent action. Qualcomm has moved higher since the market's March 2009 bottom, but with little of the gusto seen a decade ago. A breakout from a long first-stage cup in January 2012 at 58.07 yielded a gain of just 19%.


Since peaking at 68.87 at the end of March that year, Qualcomm got smothered by sellers. But when the stock finally poked above its 10-week moving average in July, (**1)** it was not a time to short. Neither was the pattern a proper head and shoulders, or a late-stage breakout failure.

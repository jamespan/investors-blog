Retail companies can be great generators of wealth for the long investor.


Yet since they can make such outstanding gains in the stock market, so too they can produce nifty opportunities for profits via short selling.


As noted in this monthly column over the years, the smart short seller favors those companies that appreciate greatly in price, in the range of 300% to 400% or more, then show clear signs of a major top. When the big boys and girls finally start selling hard, a long series of declines may give short sellers a unique opportunity.


It's the second, third and perhaps even fourth waves of selling that produce key short-selling patterns on a chart. In the [Jan. 27 column](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/the-short-side-can-you-target-a-weak-sector-even-in-a-bull-market-yes/), we covered the right time to have sold shares short in mall-based department store chain **Dillard's** ([DDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDS)). Today, let's study another company that has thrived in mall locations, **Signet Jewelers** ([SIG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIG)).


As a monthly chart shows (such as the ones at IBD's [MarketSmith premium service](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=mssharpen-fixed&src=A012BF2)), Signet made a giant run after bottoming out at 6.95 in March 2009. Over the next 6-1/2 years, the stock rallied 2,090% to a peak of 152.27 in October 2015.


![shortside_sig_022717](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ShortSide_sig_022717.png)Toward the end of the run, the jewelry store chain formed a long chain of bases that resulted in moderate gains, precisely from its August 2014 breakout past a 113.28 cup-style pattern all the way to a narrow flat base (143.03 entry) that started to form in the week ended Sept. 4, 2015. Regardless, that long basing pattern was quite late in the advance, considering that Signet had climbed out of a first-stage base all the way back in mid-September 2012.


At Signet's peak, its IBD ratings sparkled (95 Composite, 94 EPS and 93 RS on Oct. 30). Yet when it comes to short selling near the peak, these ratings don't matter. The first short-selling opportunity came as Signet's breakout failed and shares fell 7% below the 143.03 buy point, to around 133, during the last week of November 2015 **(1)**.


Notice how on that week, turnover exploded to 8 million shares vs. 5 million shares the prior week and double its 10-week moving average. Clearly, institutions were racing for the exits.


Signet fell to 114.88, down roughly 16% from the 133 short-sale entry, then rebounded. It would have been perfectly fine to cover the short position and protect gains. But notice how in the first two weeks of January 2016, the rally quickly got stopped short at the stock's 10-week moving average near 128, which was sloping lower. That was short-sale opportunity No. 2.


One could have covered the new short position five weeks later as the stock sank to 93.45, a gain of as much as 37%.


Signet today is not in short-selling range. The stock is deep below its 10-week moving average and trading more than 50% below that 152.27 peak. Don't short stocks that have already displayed so much weakness. Eventually, fund managers or market makers on the NYSE may come in with big share buys, trying to run in the shorts.


 Is it too late to be selling other retailers short? Possibly. Let's look at a few current examples.
On Feb. 17, industry peer **Tiffany** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)) cleared an 85.54 buy point in an eight-week flat base that is part of a long pattern going back to late 2014. It's a first-stage base, and so a no-no for short sellers.


**Nordstrom** ([JWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JWN)) fell 27% over a five-week streak of losses in December and January. Such declines over a short time frame can set the stage for the L-shape pattern, triggering a follow-on short sale. But Nordstrom has since staged decent gains in three straight up weeks, all in above-average turnover.


Among IBD's 197 industry groups, drugstores rated 192nd as of Thursday's close. Yet **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) is basing again and has kept a slow yet steady uptrend intact since bottoming out near 28 in June 2012.


Peer **CVS** ([CVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVS)) is more interesting, trading for months below its long-term 40-week moving average, which continues to slant downward. But the pharmacy chain also carries a 2.5% annualized dividend yield, which becomes a cost for short sellers.

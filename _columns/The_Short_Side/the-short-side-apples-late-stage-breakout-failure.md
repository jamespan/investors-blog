To sell stocks short profitably, you have to show quick mental reflexes. The late-stage base breakout, when it fails, is precisely one of those times when you must demonstrate that agility and courage.


A stock that has formed a late-stage base, typically its third or fourth amid a long run, is ripe for failure. This situation gives the short-seller an edge.


The time to capitalize arrives when a stock reverses hard after attempting a breakout from, say, a cup-with-handle or a flat base.


When the stock falls 7% to 8% below the correct buy point, sell shares short. An earlier entry point may emerge right when the stock cuts below the 50-day moving average in big volume. When a stock is strong, it will almost never go below this key intermediate-term support level.


At this type of short sale, the stock's IBD proprietary ratings are usually still red-hot. This may seem counterintuitive. But the EPS Rating takes into account a company's profit growth over the past three to five years. The Relative Price Strength Rating analyzes a stock's 12-month price performance vs. all companies in IBD's database. Therefore, a drop in price over the past few days — even if it is steep — is not going to send the RS Rating from 95 to 45.


So pay less attention to the ratings. Watch the stock's price-and-volume movement like a hawk.


Why do late-stage bases benefit the market bears?


By the time the stock breaks out, it's typically on most investors' radars. When a stock's power is exceedingly obvious, it's usually too good to be true.


The market itself may be tiring after a prolonged advance. So if there is heavy distribution (a problem that would be noted in The Big Picture), or sector rotation is taking place, you may be able to find several winning stocks that are near their peak.


Let's analyze the action of **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) back in the fourth quarter of 2012. The tech giant began its long price run in the spring of 2004, when it broke out at 24.94 (before a 2-for-1 split in 2005).


In mid-August 2012, Apple drove past a 644.10 buy point in fast trade. It rallied nearly 10%, but volume faded. By late September, trade picked up as shares fell.


On Oct. 5, Apple sliced its 50-day moving average 1, falling 14.20 points, or 2%, to 652.59. Volume grew heavy 2. Time to sell short. Apple held a Composite Rating of 91, a 99 EPS Rating, an 87 RS and an A for SMR. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating was a middling C.


The time to cover came on Nov. 16. The stock dived to as low as 505.75 before reversing wildly and rising to 527.68 3, up 2.05 in gargantuan turnover. If you covered the stock at 522, you would have walked away with a 25% gain in hand.


Apple later reported that earnings per share in the December-ended quarter fell 18% as revenue growth decelerated to 11%, the smallest increase in more than three years. Competition from Samsung and other smartphone rivals were taking a bite of Apple's business.


Apple also faced the law of large numbers. Quarterly revenue had long topped $30 billion. The savvy short-seller knows that great stocks tend to peak well before their growth does.

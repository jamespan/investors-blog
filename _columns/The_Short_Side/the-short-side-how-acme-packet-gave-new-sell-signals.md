Let's say you nailed the proper short-sale entry point in a former market leader like a true pro. Should you look for more selling opportunities in the same stock?


In most cases, yes.


This begs the question: In what situations should you not?


One is the state of the stock market itself. If one of the key indexes — that is, the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 or the NYSE composite — follows through powerfully after a serious decline, short-sale trades tend to have sharply lower odds of success.


Another reason: You might have initially shorted the stock deep within its decline. At some point, the stock may try to build a first-stage base, especially if it has strong or improving fundamentals. You might get shaken out.


If these two scenarios do not apply, you can use the 10-week moving average as a vital tool to scope for new entry points to the downside.


The primary short-sale entry emerges usually after a stock has crafted a [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/122812-638723-smart-short-selling-dollar-tree-stock.htm) or a [late-stage base](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/011113-640339-wynn-resorts-was-a-short-selling-success.htm). You can cover the position once the stock has fallen 20% to 25% from the ideal entry point.


If you've correctly spotted a true market leader that ran up 200%, 300% or more from a first-stage breakout, chances are good that the same stock, once it's trending lower, will make numerous attempts to climb higher and pierce through its 10-week line.


Every minichart in the newspaper features a 10-week moving average. This visual tool helps the reader see the general direction of the stock over the past 10 weeks of trading. Once a stock is moving in a clear trend, it's hard to stop that trend.


Watch for the stock to rally for a week or longer as it tries to rebound. Such rebounds are inevitable; some traders are buying on the dip, and some are covering their shorts. The temporary lift in demand may push the stock close to or even slightly above the 10-week line. (You can also view the stock's action on a daily chart and see if it's trying to rally back above the 50-day moving average.)


Once a stock has attempted to clear the 10-week line — which is usually sloping lower at an acute angle — and is stalling, that may be a ripe moment to short the stock. As always, cut your loss and cover the stock if it rises 8% beyond your short-sale price.


In 2011, **Acme Packet** ([APKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APKT)) showed how some big winners make multiple trips to the 10-week moving average after peaking, then stage fresh sell-offs before finally bottoming out.


In 2011, the data networking play fell steadily after its late-stage cup breakout failed just days after the April 21 rally past a 77.35 entry. **(1)**


The first follow-on short-sale entry took place after the stock's rally stalled in the week July. **(2)** As the stock market grew choppy, Acme Packet's rebound came in decelerating volume — a sign of waning demand. The stock fell swiftly over the next four weeks with declines of 8.8%, 0.3%, 10.3% and 11%.


If the 10-week moving average is flattening out, more likely than not the stock is beginning to bottom out. That is not the time to use this tool for shorting. Consider the action of **Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) and **GNC Holdings** ([GNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GNC)) since January.

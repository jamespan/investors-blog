To be a good short seller, improve your chances of selecting the best stocks to profit on the downside by spending time searching for crumbling fundamentals. You will need a little extra time to do such research. Such efforts usually pay off.


"Crumbling" is hard to quantify. But given how important earnings are to a stock's health, be on the lookout for any signs of slowing in the size of profit increases, or even the possibility that profits are in fact falling vs. year-ago levels.


Suppose a company routinely notches year after year of high double-digit or even triple-digit percentage gains in earnings per share. Such companies are rare. That's why in a sea of thousands of stocks, only a small group shows EPS gains at the 25% to 50% rate or even higher. But market conditions change, competitors pop up, and rivals fight back. Plus, if a company commits missteps in execution, innovation or strategy, earnings are naturally going to slow down.


In short, there are many reasons in which a company's growth train can quickly run off the tracks.

Stock prices may go down hard before the company sees a major decline in profits or even goes into the red.


In the 2000s, **Teva Pharmaceutical Industries** ([TEVA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEVA)) was a wonder stock. Even as the Nasdaq composite plunged almost 80% during the bear market of March 2000 to October 2002, Teva nearly doubled in price. After breaking out of a long base near 6.57 (adjusted for stock splits) in November 1999, shares ramped up 888% nearly 11 years later to a peak of 64.95 by March 2010.


Why was the generic-drug stock so hot? The Israeli company mastered the U.S. and other markets. Sales and earnings gushed higher. Earnings per share rose 36% in 1999, then 29%, 55%, 39%, 37%, 37%, 12% and 45% in the next seven years through 2006. Huge growth! Sales increased at a similar pace. The business media covered Teva a lot.


In 2012, revenue eclipsed $20 billion for the first time. Teva, now the 800-pound gorilla, was facing the law of large numbers, which makes it so much harder for big companies to sustain fast growth rates in both the top and bottom lines. Meanwhile, competition heated up. Big pharmaceutical firms began producing their own cheaper versions of branded medicines.


In 2013, Teva sales went stale. Earnings per share fell 6%, the first year-over-year drop in 15 years.


Teva shares built a gigantic saucer base for more than three years. The stock eventually broke out to 52-week highs in January 2014 and climbed from a 41.84 entry to a high of 68.75, up a respectable 64%. But a breakout from a new flat-base pattern at 68.85 produced sour grapes.


Over the next five months, Teva rallied at least three times to regain its 10-week moving average, but never hit a new high. Such action is similar to the right side of a head-and-shoulders pattern. That's the time to get ready for a short sale. A good short entry emerged near 64.18 in January 2016, just as the U.S. equity markets plunged that month.


By mid-March, Teva slid to the 52-53 level, and the gain reached 21%. Time to cover. Later attempts to rebound over the 10-week line created new short opportunities.


Like other companies, Teva decided to become an acquisition powerhouse to boost growth. In 2016, it closed a $39 billion deal to buy Actavis Generics from **Allergan** ([AGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGN)). That big buy helped boost sales in the second half of that year and the first two quarters of 2017. Earnings have been a different story. Integration of two large enterprises can be challenging.


Teva took on enormous debt to make the deal work. At the end of 2016, long-term debt nearly quadrupled to $32.5 billion, or 93% of total shareholders' equity.

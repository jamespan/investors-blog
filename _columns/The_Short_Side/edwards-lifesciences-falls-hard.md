While the market may remain in correction, numerous stocks are still carving fine uptrends. Key indexes are just an arm's length away from making new highs.


In such conditions, the opportunities for short-sellers look sparse.


IBD ran a screen for companies that meet the following criteria: EPS Rating of 95 or higher, RS Rating of 25 or lower, average daily volume of 800,000 shares or more, and trading no more than 25% below their 52-week high. Stocks trading at less than 30 a share were tossed out.


The screen found six names: **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)), **Alexion Pharmaceuticals** ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), **Whole Foods** ([WFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFM)) and **PetSmart** ([PETM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETM)). Edwards fell 23% last week after posting Q1 results showing decelerating growth. But Lululemon exited the IBD Leaderboard Cut List on April 22 due to its strong rebound.


Alexion, Ross, Whole Foods and PetSmart are all above their 10-week lines and moving sideways lately. So they are not good short-sale candidates for now.

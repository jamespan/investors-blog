  The Short Side: Great Sell Is Not A Great Short

A great sell is not a great short.


For the individual investor, selling a big market winner on signs that its run is over is challenging.


You have to count bases. You have to look for signs of falling demand for shares. And you have to consider the state of the market.


It may seem intuitively true that if you exit a stock properly, then you could follow that great sell a heartbeat later with a short sale in the same stock.


Unfortunately, that's not the case. Why?


If a stock triggers a key sell rule — such as new highs on low volume, a serious drop in the heaviest volume since the start of the run, or multiple reversals in thick trading — that action won't guarantee that you're going to make money on the short side quickly.


**Show Patience**


Why? The stock may move sideways for days, weeks or months before it really starts to head lower. It may even go up sharply.


So if you short a stock too early, you could get caught in the middle of a snap-back rally and be forced to cover the short for a fast 7% or 8% loss.


The goal in short selling is to make a profit of 20% to 25% when you're right.


So what happens if you short a stock near its top, and it falls 5% to 15% from your sell point?


You'll feel like you were right. But what if the stock is actually working on a shallow cup or a flat base? If the base building is successful, then the stock is going to bottom out and turn up. Your decent gain will shrink fast.


As noted in past Short Side columns, the three main short selling entry points are as follows: 1) the [head and shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/122812-638723-smart-short-selling-dollar-tree-stock.htm); 2) the failed breakout from a flawed [late-stage base](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/011113-640339-wynn-resorts-was-a-short-selling-success.htm); and 3) upside resistance at the 10-week moving average following a peak and severe decline.


Consider **Mellanox Technologies** ([MLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MLNX)), which scored a magnificent gain after it cleared a boxy eight-week consolidation at 37.53 at the start of 2012.


The ethernet and Infiniband interconnect technology firm bounced off its 10-week moving average twice in the spring, then vaulted 50% in the week ended April 20 on juicy first-quarter results. The stock broke out again near 60 after moving in a tight range for six weeks.


In the week ended Sept. 7, Mellanox nicked a new high of 120.05 — 220% past its initial entry — and reversed for a 3% loss in the highest weekly trade in six weeks 1.


That was an early sign that the supply of shares being traded was beginning to outstrip demand.


In the next week, Mellanox gapped lower, cut its 10-week moving average and fell 8.5%. Volume surged to 13 million shares, 90% higher than the prior week. It was a second classic sell signal.


But had you begun shorting shares so soon after the peak, you could have easily been forced out with a loss. The next week, Mellanox rebounded more than 9%. The sideways shuffle in following weeks would have tested many traders' patience.


One may ask: How about a stock that goes on a classic climax run at the end of a bull market? Isn't that a great time to short?


Yes, but your timing must be perfect. It's wise to assume that 99 times out of 100, you won't sell right at the top.

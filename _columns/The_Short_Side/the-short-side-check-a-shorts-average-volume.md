When you are ready to sell stocks short, do not simply track weak action by a former big winner. Study its daily and weekly charts and identify the ideal pattern.


All of these steps are vital. But that's still not enough. Before shorting a single share, take this precautionary step: Check out the stock's average daily share volume before you pounce.


If the average daily volume does not exceed 700,000 shares, in most cases the right move is to move on to a different stock. Preferring only those stocks with such large daily turnover reduces your risk. Why?


Thinly traded stocks can be volatile and highly unpredictable. If you sell short a low-volume stock, even if you are right about the ultimate price direction, market makers and other participants have the power to run the stock up and force you out.


**Think Big Volume**


In contrast, a stock that trades 1 million, 2 million, 5 million shares or more a day on average is much more purely swayed by the actions of the true powers of the market — that is, the mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors and banks that own large amounts of shares in their portfolios.


Short-sellers make money when the tide of institutional trading takes an authentic turn in favor of the sellers, not buyers. A stock will fall because the supply of shares available for sale will swamp the level of demand.


By concentrating on truly liquid stocks, you are targeting the market's institutional-quality names.


Find out a stock's average volume by going to the IBD [Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) . You'll see the figure for "50-Day Average Volume" in the technical section of the checkup. Also find the figure at the top of a daily chart on [MarketSmith](http://www.marketsmith.com) or IBD [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx).


Software virtualization pioneer **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) posted a splendid run after breaking out of a long base at 34.30 in the week ended Aug. 28, 2009, five months after the stock market bottomed.


The stock gained 185% to a high of 97.61 1 in January 2011, and was up 466% from a 2008 low of 17.25. VMware created a third-stage base that lingered for months. In early July, VMware broke out, clearing upside resistance near 100. Volume was not fantastic, yet it was above average. The stock gained less than 12% in three weeks, then reversed.


VMware slid 6% and 13% in the next two weeks as the market fell into a correction in July. The stock also undercut the 10-week moving average near 97.50, giving short-sellers an entry. On July 20, the average daily volume for VMware was 2.18 million. As it triggered a short sale, the average volume rose to 2.3 million shares.


By the week ended Aug. 19, VMware dropped as much as 27% to as low as 76.70 — a great time to cover the short position.


Low share volume may be forgiven when the stock trades in the triple digits per share. A stock with a 500 share price and an average daily volume of only 200,000 shares actually is quite liquid. Why? The average daily dollar volume is $100 million.


That's in fact more trading action than, say, a stock that sells for 45 a share and average dollar volume is 850,000 shares, equal to more than $38 million on average daily dollar volume.

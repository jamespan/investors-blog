Trying to sell stocks short in a good market is almost like trying to surf on a tranquil lake.


You won't have fun, and you won't go far.


There really is a right time to sell short, just as there's a right time to enter the market on the long side.


For starters, think about shorting stocks only after the market has made a long advance. Then, when you start to see distribution days pile up on either the Nasdaq or the S&P 500 — and when many of the distribution days are heavy declines, such as 1% or 2% — roll up your sleeves and search hard for big winners that are failing.


When a market sinks into a significant correction, falling 10% or more, the biggest winners are bound to fall harder. By how much? Expect these stocks to correct as much 1.5 to 2.5 times the major indexes.


This tendency boosts your chances of winning with short sales. Plus, in a correction, roughly three of every four stocks will fall. So you're really increasing the odds of shorting stocks that are ripe for declines of 15%, 25% or more.


If you're really savvy, you might hook a stock that has peaked and goes into a spiraling decline.


The average drop by a major leader, once it's topped, is 72%. So a stock that peaked at 200 may fall back to 56.


Such a decline may give you multiple places in which to short the stock and nab profits on the way down.


Learn these two patterns on the short side: (1) a quick failure soon after a breakout from a late-stage base; and (2) the head and shoulders pattern. Both signify a major shift in the balance between supply and demand for a stock.


Big declines in the stock market are bound to happen. Just look at the past 16 years of U.S. market history:


The 2008-2009 bear market lasted more than a year, and the Nasdaq fell 56%.


The 2000-2002 tech crash led the Nasdaq to a 78% decline over 31 months.


The 1998 Russian ruble crisis and blow-up of Long-Term Capital Management sent the Nasdaq sliding 33% in three months.


All of these bear markets offered plenty of good opportunities and time to sell short successfully.


On Wednesday, June 11, 2008, the market did a head fake and tanked again. The Nasdaq fell 2.2% and undercut recent lows. The S&P 500 fell 1.7%; a spike in crude oil prices to $136.38 a barrel spooked investors and triggered inflation fears.


The Fed's beige book noted economic weakness in late April and early May.


Financials came under pressure with Lehman Bros. announcing plans for another capital boost. Its share price eventually hit zero.


Financial stocks were great shorts. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) topped on Oct. 31, 2007. After multiple attempts to rise back above the 10-week moving average in the summer of 2008, it went from 180 to 74 in eight weeks.


Bank of **America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) briefly reclaimed its 10-week line three times in the first five months of 2008, then rolled over ahead of the market's brutal second-half sell-off.

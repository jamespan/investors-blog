"Don't short based on a rumor or theory."


This guidance, from MarketSmith President Scott O'Neil's presentation on short selling at IBD's CAN SLIM Masters Program in December, concisely sums up a key rule in the difficult game of shorting stocks.


Rumors and theories, which can spread via the Internet and cable TV faster than a Southern California wildfire, can lead to violent price swings in a stock â€” no matter how liquid the stock is.


While nimble traders may be able to ride the fast moves up or down for quick gains, most investors are likely to get burned.


One reason: You just don't know what the stock will do in the days and weeks after a big headline affects the market.


Two: When a stock moves wildly, it has attracted swing traders, funds that use trading algorithms and the like. The stock's behavior may grow even more irrational.


To achieve more consistent results, keep your eye out for sound topping patterns. And after selling right, don't get too greedy. Take profits at 20% to 25%. This helps to avoid short-covering rallies.


**Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) continues to capture the financial news spotlight. And no wonder. The former IBD 50 member has become a battleground of Wall Street egos and the debate over network selling.


Herbalife formed a long head-and-shoulders pattern from late 2011 to late 2012. Notice how the stock made multiple rallies back above the 10-week moving average following a 33% fall in May 1.


In late October, Herbalife began its four-week slide after three rebounds back above the 10-week line, setting up a short-sale opportunity near 50. One could have covered the short in late November when it fell to 42.18 2.


This sell point arrived well before fund manager Bill Ackman publicly attacked the firm.


According to a BloombergBusinessweek article posted on the web Jan. 10, Ackman began studying Herbalife in 2011 after a researcher suggested that he take a look at the stock. He hired two law firms and forensic accountants to join the project.


On Dec. 20, Ackman went public by arguing the nutritional products firm used "inflated pricing, misleading sales information and a complicated incentive structure to hide a pyramid scheme," the article said.


Ackman's fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold 20 million shares short. That's 18.5% of total shares outstanding.


In the week ended Dec. 21, 2012, Herbalife cratered 16.66, or 38%, to 27.27. That left the stock battered and bruised, 63% below its 73 peak.


But it was not the time to hop on the short-sellers' bandwagon. When it seems too obvious to short, it's the wrong time to short.


Herbalife rebounded fiercely. It gained 7.8%, 25.9%, 8.2% and 8.7% over the next four weeks.


During that rally, the media swarmed on the hot story.


On Jan. 10, CNBC broadcast an exclusive live interview of Herbalife CEO Michael Johnson. He questioned Ackman's motives and his pledge to donate the profits of the trade to charity.


On Feb. 14, the media reported that activist fund manager Carl Icahn reported in an SEC filing that he bought 14 million shares, or 13% of the company.


Were there other warning signs that didn't have to do with big headlines? Yes.


From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2011, earnings per share grew on average 45% over that eight-quarter time frame. But from Q4 2011, EPS growth has slowed to 20% to 25% .


While that growth rate is certainly decent and nearly meets the 'C' requirement in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm, the deceleration would have given astute readers cause for concern.

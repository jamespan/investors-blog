  How To Sell Stocks Short: Focus On The Base Count

The following saying may seem obvious. It may also be worth its weight in gold for short-sellers. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. The bigger a stock's run, that is, the more likely you will be able to spot the stock's topping action and thus smartly profit from it.

  

When is a run big enough?

  

In general, the savvy short-seller looks for growth stocks that have climbed at least 300% to 400% from a proper breakout price. So if a stock initially broke out at 20, it needs to rise at least to 80 to be considered as a good candidate.

  

Here's another technique: Count the stock's bases.

  

[What is a base](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/100413-673871-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm)? On a stock chart, it marks the time in which a leader pulls back after a strong price run. When fresh demand comes into the stock, the stock bottoms out, starts rising again, completes the base, and finally breaks out to new highs in boisterous trading.

  

After a breakout, check to see if the stock rises at least 20% from the proper buy point. If yes, then a significant price drop would mark the start of a new base.

  

When a stock rallies less than 20% from a proper buy point, then corrects sharply in price, a new base is considered part of the prior one. So, a base-on-base pattern counts as one base.

  

Third-, fourth- or fifth-stage bases give higher odds of falling apart, especially if the stock's fundamentals show wear and tear or if the stock market itself is cooling. Severe declines sweep the deck clean. When a stock falls so hard that it undercuts the lowest price of its most recent base, reset the base count back to zero.

  

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), the Silicon Valley pioneer of video streaming for the movie and TV industry, broke out of a deep first-stage base at 38.93 in early March 2009. That month, one of the worst bear markets in generations came to a halt. The S&P 500 staged a follow-through on March 12, rising 4.1% in heavier NYSE volume on Day 5 of a new rally attempt.

  

People who still felt bearish about the market and tried to short the stock got thumped. Netflix ramped up 29% in six weeks, then corrected to form a stage-two base that was far less deep **(1)**. The 5-1/2-month cup with handle showed some rough edges, yet the decline from head to toe was just 28%, easily within the normal decline for such a pattern.

  

In the prior base (not seen in the chart), the dive from 40.90 to 17.90 in 2008 was 56%, in step with the bone-crushing bear market.

  

Netflix broke out in the week ended Oct. 16, 2009 in accelerating volume. The [IBD ratings](http://education.investors.com/courselandingpage.aspx?id=735749) were stellar: a 97 Composite, 97 EPS, 69 RS and B for Accumulation/Distribution. With a bull-market tailwind, Netflix soared 531% over the next 21 months. It also formed four more bases in the process.

  

Base No. 6 was poison.

  

See on the weekly chart how it was V-shaped and only four weeks long? They were two grave flaws. When Netflix slumped below a 277.80 buy point and cut through the 10-week moving average near 269, it triggered a short-sale entry. Three weeks later, the short position could be covered for a quick 25% profit.

  

Today? Netflix is not a sound candidate. Its recent dive below the low of a base formed in July to August 2014 reset the base count.

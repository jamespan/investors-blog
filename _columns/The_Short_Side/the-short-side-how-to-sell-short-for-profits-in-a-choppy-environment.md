When the going gets choppy, the smart short seller goes for smaller profits.


If you've been reading IBD for a while, especially the [Investor's Corner](https://www.investors.com/category/how-to-invest/investors-corner/) and [Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) columns, you know that adjusting your expectations helps pave the road to savvy trades on the long side.


It's no different on the short side of stock investing.


The aims for both long trades and short trades are symmetrical. After you buy a stock on a solid breakout, you hold the stock with the goal of selling it for a profit of 20% to 25%. You cut losses at 7%-8% maximum. When the market trend is cloudy, you simply aim for more realistic gains in the 10% to 15% range and cut losses more quickly, ideally at 3% to 5%.


This strategy is rational on the short side as well. Even if the market is in a correction, the major indexes may not actually fall that much. It's not 2008 every year.


So even if your focus is laser-sharp in your stock selection and short-sale entry points, you can expect some of your gains to fail to reach the 20%-25% goal line. When a stock begins to show support at a key price level -- such as a round number or at an area where the stock had bottomed out in the past -- and then begins to rebound, take a look at the general market. Is the market's decline slowing? Are the major indexes locked in a certain price range? Are stocks in related industries firming up? Has IBD's [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/) changed?![SHRTsd053016](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SHRTsd053016.jpg)


If the answer is yes to one or more of these questions, be ready to take at least some gains more quickly. Even a nice string of modest gains can lead to a great year for your account.


The year 2015 was choppy for investors, yet luxury accessories and clothing retailer **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) had been in a long downtrend following its peak at 101.04 in February 2014. The former market leader had gushed 266% in price after breaking out of a thin IPO base with a 27.68 buy point on Jan. 17, 2012.


Kors sold off hard from May to July 2015, then went sideways for months. The stock's [Relative Price Strength Rating](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-michael-kors-hldgs-ltd-kors.aspx) had plunged below 25 on a scale of 1 to 99, just what you’d like to see in a former leader you want to short.


In the fourth quarter of 2015, Kors gave two opportunities to short as it broke below the 10-week moving average. One came during the week ended Oct. 16 near 42.66 **(1)**, while the general market still traded in a confirmed uptrend but Kors was lagging severely with a 17 RS Rating. Weekly volume accelerated that week, signaling heavy selling by fund managers. Remember, it's the funds that control up to as much 80 cents on every dollar traded in the stock market.


A second short sale opportunity emerged during the week ended Dec. 11 **(2)** as Kors melted after trying again to rise back above its 10-week near 40.89. This time, the market had just slipped into a correction after the S&P 500 suffered its ninth distribution day over the previous 25 trading sessions. Kors' earnings growth had fallen fast, from 73% in the fourth quarter of 2013 to a respective 56%, 49%, 41% and 33% during the four quarters of 2014, and then 15%, 2% and 7% in the first three periods of 2015.


Here, you could have covered for a gain of 12% and 17%, respectively, if you were lucky to cover right at the bottom of each short-term decline. In both cases, the short sale failed to produce a gain in the 20%-25% range. And you had to cover quickly to avoid a round trip.


Without doubt, these short plays appear deep within Kors' long-term downtrend. Too late? Perhaps. Yet a much earlier short sale encountered an equally stiff headwind. Check out the week ended Jan. 9, 2015 **(3)**, when the stock tried to touch its 10-week line near 74.12 and then skidded like a high heel on a banana peel. Weekly volume spiked. But Kors rebounded over the next month. Again, one had to nimble in taking small gains.

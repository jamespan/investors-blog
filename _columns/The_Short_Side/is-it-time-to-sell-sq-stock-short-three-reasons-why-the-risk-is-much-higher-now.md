  Is It Time To Sell SQ Stock Short? Three Reasons Why The Risk Is Much Higher Now

Is it time to sell **Block** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) short? Given the big decline in SQ stock since early November, many IBD readers may feel tempted to do so.




However, close analysis of the recent price-volume action in Block, formerly known as Square, hints that new opportunities to short this former huge market winner are thin â€” at least in the near term. Plus, as the stock market strives to bottom out amid Russia's fierce attempt to take over Ukraine, perhaps [SQ stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-buy-now/) itself may be putting in at least a short-term bottom.


That would boost risk for new short sellers.


Let's first cover when was the correct time to sell Block short in 2021.


SQ Stock: A Safer Short Sale Entry Point
----------------------------------------


From February to July of 2021, the provider of software, hardware and financial services for small and medium merchants built a base best described as a [long consolidation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/shopify-stock-consolidation-pattern-led-to-beautiful-gains/). While it was technically a [second-stage base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) since the 2020 bear market bottom, keep in mind that Block rallied more than 700% from that year's low of 32.33.


That kind of move made Block ripe for a serious correction.


In the week ended July 23, 2021, SQ stock rolled past a 254.88 [handle buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) within its long base. The rally worked for a few weeks; by early August, Block gained 13% and hit new all-time highs. That's a decent move.



But then the breakout began to unravel.


Nearly two months later, Block undercut its 10-week moving average. Volume during the week ended Sept. 10 turned out to be bone dry. Yet the price action was certainly bearish. That same week, SQ slunk below its buy point of 254.88.


SQ Stock's Shorting Opportunity
-------------------------------


That's a failed breakout after a long, strong move up.


When [SQ stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-buy-now/) fell to 237 in October, it triggered the [golden rule of CAN SLIM investing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/): Cut your losses short.


And that action also marked an initial [short-sale entry](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/why-the-late-stage-base-can-be-a-short-sellers-good-friend/). It takes real courage to sell such a longtime market leader short. But after many successful breakouts and a multiyear climb, such a stumble by a big winner provides an early buy opportunity.



During the week ended Oct. 29, bullish investors and market makers pushed the stock back from its early-October low of 222.92. That rebound would have forced most short sellers at 237 to cover their position and keep losses small.


However, notice how in that same week, Block finished low in the week's range. True, it was a third straight week of gains. But volume in each of those weeks was flaccid. Call it a meek rebound at best.


One might also describe such price-and-volume action as wedging.


Over the next five weeks, SQ stock went into a severe decline. In early November, the new drop through the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) near 250 presented a new short-selling opportunity.

The Best Time To Cover A Short Stock
------------------------------------



The IBD strategy calls for covering a successful short sale when the profit reaches 20% to 25%.


So, once Block sank below 200, it was a good time to buy back shares.


Could a short seller have decided to, say, cover just half of that position, and then see how the rest fared? Sure, especially given that [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-spot-stock-market-tops-track-the-distribution-days/) began to crop up on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. On Dec. 3, IBD also downgraded the health of the stock market to "correction" from "uptrend under pressure."


For a tanking stock, a rebound back to the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) (on a daily chart) or the 10-week line often offers a secondary short-sale entry. And on Monday, Block outperformed the stock market with a 6% gain in heavy volume. SQ also touched its 50-day line for the first time in three months.


But at this point, attempting a short sale carries far more risk of losses.


On Wednesday, Block failed to participate in the broad market rebound. Shares fell 2.6% in afternoon trading and continue to bend beneath the 50-day line. Volume at 2 p.m. ET was running a touch above its average over the past 50 sessions.


On Feb. 25, during that massive gap-up in price, more than 64 million shares exchanged hands, 276% above average.


Upside Risks
------------


Here are three reasons why:


First, Block, at its February low of 82.72, has already plunged almost 71% from its all-time peak of 289.23. Any high-quality growth company that falls 50% or more from its peak typically sees a period of strong gains as growth and value players reenter the stock.


Second, SQ stock saw 64.5 million shares exchange hands amid a strong earnings-related gap-up. That marked the heaviest trading in at least two years. Such action indicates the sellers are exhausted and bargain hunters stampeded into the stock.


Third, Block's credit card payment processing industry group ranks poorly among IBD's 197 industry groups. But it also houses several leading stocks, including **American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and **Everi** ([EVRI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EVRI)), a small cap in the gaming industry. Fundamentally, an economy that continues to recover from the pandemic may indicate that solid fundamentals will draw more investors into companies such as Block.

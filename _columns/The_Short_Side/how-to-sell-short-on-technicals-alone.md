  The Short Side: Sell Short On Stock Technicals Alone

Do you want to sell stocks short with success? And do you already know IBD's CAN SLIM system for selecting great stocks on the long side?


If you answer "yes" to both questions, then you must understand this about shorting:


Focus your analysis on what the stock is doing on the chart right now, not what you think is happening to the actual company's business or its industry.


It's dangerous to sell shares short because you have concluded the company is going to disappoint investors in its next quarterly results, or simply because you see thinning lines at the company's neighborhood store.


Your job is not to be the Wall Street analyst who is forecasting what this quarter's sales and earnings are going to be.


Instead, strive to be a master at interpreting the current state of supply and demand in the market.


"This (game) is 98% technical, in my opinion," Scott O'Neil, MarketSmith president, said at IBD's CAN SLIM Masters workshop in in December.


On the long side, you do want to hunt for companies with a proven track record of growth and big-time fundamentals.


It's common for a great stock to exhibit several quarters of double- or triple-digit profit and sales growth before it busts out of a well-formed base. During a stock's run, the company will likely continue to post superb results.


But all looks great at the peak.


On the short side, drops occur fast. Fear or disappointment can trigger huge sales of shares by the institutional crowd, even if the company is still No. 1 in its industry or is growing sales and earnings at a rapid clip.


O'Neil notes it's common to find a strong short sale candidate with EPS and SMR ratings that are still excellent — even as the stock is showing true price weakness and giving sell signals.


"The Relative Price Strength Rating should be poor, 40 or under. I really prefer in the 20s or teens," he said.


When **Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) triggered a short sale entry near its downward-sloping 10-week moving average in mid-October, the former highflier certainly fit that mold.


Formerly known as Hansen Natural, the maker of the popular Monster energy drinks, fruit juices and all-natural sodas scored a 96 Earnings Per Share Rating in IBD's Oct. 19, edition. But its RS Rating was a 25 — a far cry from its 98 rating when the stock hit a closing weekly high of 78.64 in the week ended June 15.


In the June 18 paper, Monster was a sector leader and the Food/Beverage industry was No. 1.


If one shorted Monster as it fell back below the 10-week line near 56, the right time to cover was one week later. The stock fell as much as 25% to a low of 40.


What types of stocks are perhaps showing the same criteria as Monster did last October?


**Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)),  **PetSmart** ([PETM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PETM)) and **Whole Foods Market** ([WFM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFM)) have EPS Ratings of 95 or higher, RS Ratings of less than 25, and trade at least 800,000 shares a day. All three have made big runs but are now struggling to climb back above their 10-week moving averages.


In the end, trust the chart, not the fundamentals.

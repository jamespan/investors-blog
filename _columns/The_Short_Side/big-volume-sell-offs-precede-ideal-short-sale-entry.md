Imagine you've just sold short some shares of a fallen leader. Volume is surging as the stock drops.


You're happy. You're making money.


Of course, this is the ideal scenario. But how do you really boost the chances that your trade is going to be a winner?


It's actually quite easy: look for weeks in which the stock suffers a big decline in huge volume.


If that hasn't happened, sit on your hands and look elsewhere.


One of the paradoxes of successful short-selling is that you must wait for the stock to dive in big volume before going in. When a stock gets hit with such a dramatic sell-off, it's more than likely to happen again.


An institution or two may have millions of shares to dispose of and seal their profits. These large players typically need days, if not weeks, to liquidate a big position completely. Thus, the most successful short plays see multiple rounds of high-volume declines as they correct 30%, 50% or more from their highs.


As you study a prospective stock to short, look at its weekly chart closely, especially near the area in which it peaked in price.


Do you see a week or two in which the stock falls 10% or 15%, and volume is screaming? Is the volume bar one of the tallest on the chart in months? If yes, it's time to spot either the head-and-shoulders pattern or the breakdown following a breakout from a third-, fourth- or even later-stage base.


**Skechers USA** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) was a great short back in the second half of 2001. An alert trader could have sold shares as the Manhattan Beach, Calif., athletic-shoe maker tried to rebound back above its downward-sloping 10-week moving average near 22.35, then reversed for a 7% loss in the week ended Sept. 7, 2001.


The next week, on Sept. 11, al-Qaida terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners, sending two into New York's World Trade Center. When the stock markets reopened on Sept. 17, Skechers cratered. It fell 47% over the next 12 trading sessions in heavy volume, allowing plenty of chances to cover the short for a big gain.


How did the decline set up?


Skechers was clearly under heavy selling pressure well before the 9/11 tragedy. The breakout from a sloppy third-stage base with a 32.30 buy point produced a 25% gain to a peak of 40.30.


The stock fell for three straight weeks as the general market headed lower. In the week ended June 15, Skechers slid 17% and fell below its 10-week moving average in volume that shot 72% higher than its 10-week average 1.


MarketSmith President Scott O'Neil likens those sharp declines to torpedoes of sellers that are piercing holes into the hull of a warship. It takes only a few such torpedoes to sink a ship.


Another such torpedo sell-off took place in the week ended July 20 2, when Skechers got pounded for a 22% loss to 21 in big volume.


That was not the time to short. Skechers rebounded furiously in two of the next four weeks 3.


But the rebound fell flat. The stock essentially treaded water for weeks in an L-shape-like [pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm), setting up the prime short-sale entry.

This past week the Dow Jones industrials finally climbed over the wall of 20,000, nearly 18 years after it cracked the 10,000 barrier (in February 1999) and more than 50 years after it hit 1,000 in January 1966.


That said, corrections in individual stocks and the market itself provide savvy traders a limited yet legitimate opportunity to profit from brief, fast price declines. It's highly preferable to sell short when the market is in a pronounced downtrend. Yet an experienced speculator can find opportunities in a specific industry niche — even when the major indexes are generally rising.


The evolving economy, new competition, and game-changing technology and innovations allow companies to enter an industry and grab market share. The incumbents see their sales and profits squeezed. When fundamentals erode, you can bet that the stock market will have guessed this development months or even years in advance.


Since the Jan. 8, 2015, follow-through by the Nasdaq composite, stocks have certainly suffered some nasty bumps along the way. Yet the uptrend has been stubborn, and both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have recently touched new highs. The same cannot be said for members of IBD's department stores industry group, which currently lies at a lowly No. 194 out of [197 IBD groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-jan-26-2017/).


Retail chains have seen shrinking foot traffic as more people shop online. And **Dillard's** ([DDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDS)) has not escaped the incredible impact that the internet and e-commerce have had on buying and selling goods.


So, when was the right time to sell Dillard's shares short? One moment came as the stock formed a miniature L-shape pattern with a 112.30 entry point in the spring of 2015.


![shrtsidedds013017](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ShrtSideDDS013017.png)From April 27 to May 15, Dillard's fell almost 18% to as low as 112.30. That unusual drop followed a steady multiyear rally. The stock's character had changed. Note, too, how this vertical-like decline, forming the first part of the L-shape **(1)**, came just a few weeks after the department store chain made new highs in low volume four sessions in a row in early April **(2)**.


Dillard's tried to rebound, rising 1.5% on May 18, then 0.6% the next day. Volume was sharply above average on both of those sessions, yet paled compared with the 2.6 million shares changing hands on May 15, when the stock suffered its 7% wallop. Dillard's failed to make more headway and finished up the horizontal part of the L-shape.


Dillard's then triggered a short-sale entry by falling hard four days in a row June 4-9, sinking below the L-shape pattern's low of 112.30. Roughly a month later, the stock was testing the 100 level, down more than 12% from the prime short-sale trigger.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was bobbing up and down within a narrow price channel, briefly poking to new highs before ducking lower, ahead of the Aug. 19-25 market flash crash. Such conditions certainly did not help the bargain hunters in Dillard's or its peers **Kohl's** ([KSS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KSS)) and **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)).


Dillard's continued to slide lower, producing a 20% gain for those who sold short at 112.30 and covered near 93 **(3)**. One could have decided to cover in August when the stock fell to 89, good for an overall profit of 25%. By January 2016, Dillard's reached as low as 60.66, down 46% from the 112.30 entry, before shares finally rebounded.


Dillard's staged a terrific profit turnaround after the 2008-2009 Great Recession. Thanks in part to solid operating expense control and higher same-store sales, the Little Rock, Ark., firm jumped back into the black in FY 2010. It boosted profits from 73 cents that year to $7.70 in FY 2015.


However, revenue has been virtually flat since FY 2014, and profits have suffered. In FY 2016, earnings per share dropped 13% and are seen falling another 17% to $5.55 in FY 2017, which ends in January this year.


 As seen by the current weekly chart, Dillard's and other department store retailers have remained market laggards.
As seen in [IBD Stock Checkup](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-dillards-inc-dds.aspx), Dillard's shows a poor 11 Relative Price Strength Rating from 1 to 99 and a 3 Composite Rating.

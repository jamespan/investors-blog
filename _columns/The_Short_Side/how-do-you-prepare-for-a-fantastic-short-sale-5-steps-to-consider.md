When a hurricane is coming, smart homeowners prepare. When the next hurricane of sellers floods Wall Street, how does a savvy short-seller get ready?


Preparing early is key. This is not the same as shorting stocks early. Sell too early and your portfolio could suffer irreparable damage.


Instead, be methodical. These steps may help.


**Step 1: Don't try to pick the top.** Wait for signs that a major top, in the general market or in a specific sector, has occurred, then assemble a good watchlist. Reading [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) will help. As the great trader Jesse Livermore is known to have said, you want to be on the right side of the market.


**Step 2: Look for huge winners.** The rule of thumb is to demand that a stock has risen at least 300% in price. The more, the better. Any less than that and you might end up trying to short a company with more room to grow. The accompanying table shows stocks that have strong EPS ratings, an average daily trading volume of at least 700,000 shares, a gain of at least 100% over the past 24 months, and are trading at least 35 a share. They include the dental technology firm **Align Technology** ([ALGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALGN)), which has soared more than 3,000% from its October 2008 low.


The IBD 50 is also a good place to look.



**Step 3: Find startling declines in massive volume.** What is "startling"? Check out the daily chart of former market leader **Acuity Brands** ([AYI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AYI)), which was a short-sale idea at Leaderboard earlier this year. On Oct. 5, Acuity dropped 4.7% in massive volume. Then the LED lighting firm slumped 5.6% in double normal volume on Dec. 20 — telltale signs that savvy fund managers were rushing for the exits.


IBD's [Stocks On The Move](http://research.investors.com/stocksonthemove.aspx?stklist=up) screen, which runs throughout the trading session, is a good place to start. Go to the [Stock Lists](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-to-watch-top-rated-ipos-big-caps-and-growth-stocks/) section at Investors.com. Another tip: Go to the full 197 industry group rankings and see which groups and subgroups fell the hardest for the day. Then pinpoint the most liquid, heavy decliners. To see the entire rankings, go to [Data Tables](https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/) in Stock Lists at Investors.com.


**Step 4: Spot emerging bearish patterns.** Take time to [use charts](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/). Has a stock broken out of a late-stage base? Is a head and shoulders forming? If the stock has already formed these patterns, is a test of resistance at the 10-week moving average shaping up?


**Step 5: Check the short interest.** Is it excessive? If so, take a pass. Please see [last month's column](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/when-not-to-sell-short-be-wary-of-a-stock-with-heavy-short-interest/), published on May 26 and available online at [Short Selling](https://www.investors.com/short-selling/) in the Research section of Investors.com.

In l[ast week's inaugural column of The Short Side](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/122112-638051-short-selling-strategy-involves-patience.htm), we noted how patience is critical to finding the right time to sell a stock short.


Just as important as patience is the skill to take swift action when that moment has come.


One reason: fear.


The primal human emotion of fear causes stocks to roll over faster than greed can send stocks higher. (The exception, of course, is when a stock goes into a classic climax run.)


**The Set-Up**


Let's consider the head-and-shoulders pattern, one of two basic set-ups you need to know to find great stocks to short.


In many cases, it takes five to seven months after a former market leader has topped before the short sale entry point appears. In other cases, the opportunity grows ripe in just three months' time.


Yet, once the time to short a stock arrives, you literally have one or two days in which to sell shares at a prime price.


"You have a narrow window of opportunity," Investor's Business Daily Chairman Bill O'Neil said. When it comes to shorting a stock after it has peaked, "50 days you are wrong (to do so), and two days you are right. The odds are stacked against you."


**Dollar Tree** ([DLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DLTR)) was a superb stock within the vast retailing sector. After clearing a 17.34 flat-base entry point in late February 2010, the stock rallied 228% over the next 28 months.


The seller of goods priced $1 each made a high-volume test of its 10-week moving average in the week ended May 18.  **(1)**


At the time, the market was in a correction. But Dollar Tree bounced back fast and rose to new highs just three weeks later. The stock rallied as high as 56.82 before reversing lower in the week ended June 22. **(2)**


This action over nearly two months formed the left shoulder and head of an ensuing pattern.


Just one week later, Dollar Tree split its shares 2-for-1, its second split in two years.


A rebound off the 10-week moving average fell flat. Volume paled vs. the prior two down weeks. **(3)**


The stock then began having trouble keeping its head above the 10-week line, a significant change in behavior. Expect such changes when a stock is ready to go into a significant downtrend.


**10-Week Line Resistance**


In the week ended Aug. 10, Dollar Tree tried to rally back above the 10-week line but got shoved lower. **(4)** Yet it wasn't the time to sell short. Why? Dollar Tree had just peaked less than two months earlier. Rather, the stock was in the middle of crafting the pattern's right shoulder.


Those who tried to short were in for a wild ride the following week. That's when Dollar Tree reported July-quarter results (EPS up 31%, down from 144% growth in the prior quarter).


The right short-sale entry came in early October, **(5)** nearly four months after the June 20 peak.


On Oct. 5, Dollar Tree rose 3% to 48.07 — 15% below its 56.81 peak — but failed to get above its 50-day line and stalled. Then it fell 2% and 3% the next two sessions, the second day in accelerating volume.


This was the two-day window of opportunity to sell short.


It can be hard to judge exactly how many times a stock tests its 10-week moving average. In Dollar Tree's case, it's reasonable to say that the stock had made three unsuccessful attempts to reclaim that key support level.


A second short-sale entry emerged in the week ended Nov. 30, five months after the head formation.


Other stocks in the retail and consumer goods sectors that also display weakness today include outdoor sports equipment and apparel chain **Cabella's** ([CAB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAB)), luxury leather goods and accessories giant **Coach** ([COH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COH)),  **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)), **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) and **Under Armour** ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) .


Cabella's has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern from August. Ross Stores didn't form a true head-and-shoulders pattern. Yet on a weekly chart, notice how the stock frequently stalled or posted negative reversals near the 70 round number level.


Scott O'Neil, president of MarketSmith, notes that once a former leader has topped, expect to see the Relative Price Strength Rating to go below 40. That's a sign of heavy selling pressure.


Keep these names on a short-selling watch list, especially if the market uptrend fails to continue in 2013. Monitor the strength of the retail sector, too. If it improves, the probability of making money on the short side falls fast.

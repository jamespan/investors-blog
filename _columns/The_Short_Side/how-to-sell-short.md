Besides the [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm) and the [late-stage base](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/053014-702808-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) breakout failure, a stock might etch a third chart pattern that gives traders an opportunity to capture gold on the downside.


The L-pattern does not necessarily show up in every former market winner that tops and makes a huge decline. But when it does appear, you not only get an opportunity to sell shares short.


You also get further confirmation of the stock's weakness.


IBD research on this pattern is in its early stages. Yet it's clear that several characteristics of the L-pattern emerge.


First, look for a steep decline after a stock has peaked in price. A stock may fall 20% to 40%, or even more, in a few weeks or months. That wicked drop forms the vertical part of the L.


Second, watch how the stock recovers. Bargain-hunting traders step in to stop the slide. Yet the stock is still held by minions of unhappy, desperate shareholders who aim to unload their shares.


So the rally stalls. At best, the stock moves sideways at least three to four weeks. The bottom section of the L forms.


Even as the L forms, the stock may still act highly volatile.


After all, when a stock has fallen sharply, it may rebound with fury as some traders cover their short positions. Other participants with deep pockets may buy shares and try to run in the shorts.


This brings us to the third critical characteristic: The size of decline and the rebound must be in proper proportion. The rebound should be limited in percentage terms compared with the drop. In other words, the L should look tall and thin, not squat .


**Mechel OAO** ([MTL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTL)) staged a waterfall decline from its high of 58.66 in May 2008 — just before the market plunged late that year — to 3.63 by November the same year.


Before that 94% drop, the Russian steel maker forged a series of bases and broke out to marvelous gains. The total climb from an initial breakout in January 2007 past 26.80 (before a 3-for-1 split in May) was 557%.


Mechel's price swing within the horizontal part of the L may look a bit wide and loose. And it was.


Yet the weekly chart shows that the overall sideways action was relatively compressed vs. the near-vertical drop that preceded it.


In the week ended Sept. 26, Mechel touched the 10-week moving average near 23.92 at the end of September, a good entry point.


The stock then slid 73% over the next two weeks to as low as 6.51, offering plenty of opportunity to cover the position.


When the stock tried to rally hard in August, note how volume was generally below average **(1)**. Demand was far from overwhelming. Yet it was still too early to short.


The week ended Sept. 5 **(2)** was not the right time; the weakness was too obvious. Mechel bounced back the next week.


You really need a severe drop to form the first part of a good L-pattern. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) joined the Leaderboard [Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/) on Sept. 15, then dropped 21% in a single week in October. An L-pattern formed, yet the overall decline did not match Mechel's. The short play worked well for a while. It fell from a 374.60 entry to 315.54, a 19% gain for shorts, but recouped all of its losses following better-than-expected Q4 results Jan. 20.

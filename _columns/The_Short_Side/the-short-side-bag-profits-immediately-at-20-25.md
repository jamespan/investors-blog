In the business of short selling, it may be worthwhile to recall and honor the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson.


The American philosopher once said, "In skating over thin ice, our safety is in our speed."


Good short sellers should relate to those eloquent words.


If you have sold shares short correctly, you should see the stock drop within the next day or two, if not immediately. By the end of the week, the stock may be down 5% to 10% or more, a smart gain.


(Look at the archives of Short Side articles at Investors.com to learn the proper entry points for a short sale of a former market winner that is breaking down.)


In many cases, the stock may be down 20% to 25% within a couple of weeks.


You feel good. Paradoxically, that's precisely the moment when you should buy back those borrowed shares and cover the position. Why? The bullish forces will support the stock and try to flush out the shorts.


The gains from a good short trade won't likely vaporize at the speed that a water puddle might on an Abu Dhabi sidewalk. But if you let greed take over your brain, you just might see your gain get cut in half in little time.


Wait a bit longer, and your short position may soon be sitting on cracking ice. So never let a good short position melt into a losing one. This point is especially critical when you are playing with a fast-moving stock — you know, one that routinely moves 5%, 10% or 15% within a single week, or more.


To decide if a stock is highly volatile, do not depend on a stock's beta ratio. Closely eye the weekly chart. If the intraweek swing (price high minus low, divided by the week's low, then multiplied by 100) is consistently big, then you know you have to take profits judiciously.


Still feeling supremely confident that your stock will fall more than 25% from where you shorted it? Consider selling half of your position, so that at least some gains have been secured.


**Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) had a marvelous run from 2009 to its late-April 2012 peak. The direct marketer of nutritionals and diet shakes had crafted several bases after hopping out of a cup-with-handle in October 2009. Life was good.


Then the Cayman Islands-based company became the short-sale target of hedge-fund manager David Einhorn. In the week ended May 4, 2012, Herbalife plunged 33% in the heaviest trading since 2007.


The stock's week-to-week price swings grew dramatically in size and frequency. Over time, the stock made a giant head-and-shoulders pattern from November 2011 to October 2012. If you sold shares short near 50 during the week ended Oct. 26, the stock would have been tough to hold, because it soon rallied as much as 6% above the prime short entry.


You could have also shorted shares near 49 in the week ended Nov. 30 **(1)**. Herbalife struggled to rebound but nosedived in the week ended Dec. 21 after Pershing Square Capital's Bill Ackman said he was shorting it.


At the week's low, you would have been up 88%. Time to cover — fast. Over the next four weeks, Herbalife vaulted 73% **(2)**, eating away at those gains. By Jan. 16, 2013, the gain had shrunk to 4%.

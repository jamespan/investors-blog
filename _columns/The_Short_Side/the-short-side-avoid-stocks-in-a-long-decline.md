  The Short Side: Avoid Stocks In A Long Decline

You've unearthed a stock that clearly was a great one in the past. The stock has been on the decline, but lately it hasn't fallen much over a long period of time. And by "long" we mean years.


Should you keep watching it? In most cases, no. Here are some reasons why.


Regular readers of this column know that IBD teaches two principal patterns in which to sell shares short. One, the [head and shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/040513-650844-how-to-sell-short-in-the-market.htm); two, the bungled breakout from a [late-stage base](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/041913-652653-how-to-sell-short.htm).


In the first pattern, it usually takes five to seven months since the stock's peak before the ideal entry point arrives. In some cases, the pattern develops more quickly. You could see the right shoulder form in just a couple months' time before the stock begins to really break down.


In general, though, five to seven months are necessary. It's a long enough time for the last remaining bulls to charge into the stock, even when a chart makes it clear that the stock has made a tremendous price run and has topped.


In the second pattern, the length of the late-stage base can vary. It can be a five-week flat base. It can be a nine-month cup with handle. In either case, the savvy short-seller must be on his or her toes as the stock finally breaks out, stalls, and starts to fall like a sky diver. The right time to sell short can come just days or weeks after the breakout.


If you're analyzing a stock that peaked years ago and has not summoned the strength to rack new highs, you're looking at a laggard stock. But a lagging stock doesn't mean it's an ideal one to short.


You might be able to sell shares short and buy back at a price a few points lower. But what if the stock is essentially moving sideways? You could be limiting your profit potential as you wait for a big decline that never unfolds. Or the stock may turn choppy, forcing you to cover for a small loss.


The goal for short selling is to target former market leaders that are on the verge of making a serious breakdown. When your timing is right, then the chances of bagging a 20% to 25% profit in little time are much greater.


Let's say you've been watching **Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)). The fertilizer giant peaked at 80.54 (after a 3-for-1 split) in June 2008, capping a hefty run during the 2003-to-2007 bull market. The large-cap play made a swan dive over the next five months, falling 80% to a low of 15.85. (Please see a historical chart.) A late-stage breakout failure precipitated that dramatic fall.


It's been more than five years since Potash hit that price peak. That's too long.


From late 2008 to the end of 2010, Potash staged a valiant comeback. It rose 304% to a three-year high of 63.97, then worked on a new base 1. The breakout in dull volume failed fast. But this wasn't a late-stage breakout. So even if the stock did drop 20% in less than three weeks, it wasn't a proper entry for short sellers.


Subsequent declines did reach 20% or more, like the slide from February to June 2012 2. The 40-week moving average acted like a ceiling of resistance, too. But notice how the stock drifted upward twice 3, making it tough to stand firm and hold tight.

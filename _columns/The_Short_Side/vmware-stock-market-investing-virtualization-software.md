  'L Pattern' Leads To Additional Short Entry Points

Once a former stock-market leader has topped, the average decline is 72%. That's right — 72%.

  

Remember, that's an average figure, based on IBD research. Some stocks fall 90% or more from their all-time peaks. That's like seeing a stock go from 100 to 10.

  

Why mention this statistic?

  

It means the astute short seller has multiple opportunities to sell shares in a former star throughout the ride down in price.

  

That begs another question: If the head-and-shoulders and late-stage breakout failure patterns have already formed and the stock has already fallen a lot, what other types of price-and-volume action should you hunt for?

  

Consider the L-shaped pattern.

  

How does it form? After a stock has fallen hard in big volume, sellers need a break. They don't want to create a situation in which they must sell the rest of their position at fire-sale prices.

  

So you'll often see a former big winner move sideways for several weeks or months. On the buying side, bargain hunters are snapping up shares. But because demand is not overwhelming, the stock does not have enough strength to carve the bottom of a potential new base.

  

All good cups, saucers and double bottoms form a right side, because demand is now outweighing supply.

  

When that doesn't happen, an L is more likely to form on the weekly chart.

  

Scott O'Neil, president of MarketSmith, introduced this pattern during a presentation at the CAN SLIM Masters Program workshop in Santa Monica on Dec. 8 and 9 last year. He says research on this specific chart behavior is ongoing. Yet he's found plenty of examples of this price action before a former big winner takes another leg down.

  

Don't forget — the bigger the winner, the more likely you'll see the L pattern take shape.

  

As the horizontal portion of the pattern forms, expect to see quiet turnover on the up weeks.

  

Consider **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)), which was one of the hottest tech IPOs to emerge in 2007, right before the subprime debt crisis punctured the market's long bull run.

  

The leader in computer server virtualization software rallied from a July 2007 IPO at 29 to a high of 125.25, a 332% gain.

  

The market went into a correction in November. VMware followed suit. It slid 25% in heavy turnover in the week ended Nov. 9. The 10-week moving average, which had just begun to form only weeks before, served as upside resistance in the next three months.

  

As the 2008 bear market took shape, VMware suffered more big sell-offs, including a 28% drop in the week ended Feb. 1, 2008 1. A three-week slide in July sent the big-cap tech down 36%.

  

VMware rallied in four of the next five weeks. The gains were 3.6%, 4.5%, 7.9% and 2%. Nice, but a lot less than the weekly double-digit thumpings it took earlier. Plus, volume during the up weeks was uncomfortably light.

  

Meanwhile, notice how the 10-week moving average fell sharply and caught up with the stock. VMware attempted to rally back above the key support line but failed 2. This was a rare moment to short shares.

  

VMware dropped hard in the next seven weeks. Take profits when a gain reaches 20% to 25%.

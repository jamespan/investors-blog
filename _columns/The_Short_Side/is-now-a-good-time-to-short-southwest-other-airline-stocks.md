  Is Now A Good Time To Short Southwest, Other Airline Stocks?

Can you execute a good short sale even when the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend? Yes. But no doubt, it's trickier to do. The biggest gains on the short side are made when the market is in bear-market territory. It's typically when IBD's Market Pulse table (see the [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) today on B8) shows the current outlook as "Market in correction."


Yet the long view of history shows the market is in an uptrend most of the time. How, then, can you sell stocks with success even though the Market Pulse says "Confirmed uptrend" or "Uptrend under pressure"?


It takes a few steps. First step: Sit back and think about the market over the past year or two. Then ask yourself: Which industry groups or sectors made big, stunning price moves?


The second step: Focus on the biggest winners within those highflying groups. You might be able to find one or two that made gains of 300%, 400% or more from an early-stage base [breakout](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/040215-746318-how-is-netflix-stock.htm). Maybe it became a [Sector Leader](http://news.investors.com/investing/sector-leaders-review.htm) , or it's been a stalwart on the IBD 50.


If that stock has formed multiple bases and gained lots of media fanfare, you might have pinpointed a great candidate. At some point, the stock is going to disappoint investors. It will issue negative guidance, or miss hyper-inflated profit expectations.


Even a small profit or sales miss can trigger a selling landslide.


On April 15, **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) joined the [IBD Leaderboard's Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/). Just three weeks earlier, the highly regarded airline had tripped badly after failing to break out of a narrow flat base with a 47.27 entry.


The Cut List chart showed that a late-stage base had formed. When a breakout fails after the stock tries to run to new highs from a late pattern, a short-sale opportunity is born.


Southwest's action also resembled a five-month [head-and-shoulders pattern](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/052915-754890-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm). (See annotations on the chart to the right.)


On April 23, the stock poked above its 50-day moving average, but then closed lower. It rose again the next day, yet still could not hoist itself back above the 50-day average near 43.73.


Once Southwest began dropping back below the 50-day line, it was a great time to sell short.


The Cut List showed an annotation colored in red, "Resistance at 50-day line offers a fresh short-sale entry point." The annotation featured three separate arrows, pointing to the stock's action on April 15, April 23, and May 8.


At the time Southwest sported lofty [ratings](http://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/?nav=ResearchCheckup) : In the May 8 paper, the [Composite Rating](http://research.investors.com/etables/?nav=ResearcheTables) was 96, backed by 98 EPS and 90 RS grades. The SMR was B. But the Accumulation/Distribution had soured to a terrible grade of D+. And the transportation sector ranked a lowly 28th among 33 IBD sectors in relative performance.


A short seller could have covered the position when the stock fell below 35, yielding a profit of 20% to 25% or more.


IBD recently reported growing concerns that [airlines](http://news.investors.com/business/071015-761067-american-delays-deliveries-june-capacity-traffic-up.htm) were aggressively adding seat capacity, which would lead to a price war. It was a 180-degree change from prior years in which airlines got praise for their disciplined approach to adding more planes into the market.

  Why This Former Biotech Winner Presented A Solid Short-Sale Opportunity

Back in the start of 2018, the biotech industry group ranked a lofty No. 27 out of [197 industry groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-sub-group-rankings-jan-05-2018/) for six-month relative price performance. But that high standing also masked some weakness among some of its former big stars. The stock of **Regeneron Pharmaceuticals** ([REGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=REGN)) offered a good case study.




In fact, Regeneron stock offers a highly interesting case study for short sellers given that its initial short-selling opportunity was not quite a [late-stage breakout failure](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/why-the-late-stage-base-can-be-a-short-sellers-good-friend/). Nor did it form a true [head-and-shoulders pattern](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/seven-reasons-why-you-should-try-selling-a-stock-short/) in the way that former huge tech winner EMC did after the Nasdaq's peak in March 2000. Yet Regeneron's chart showed that the sellers were in control after the stock failed to reach new all-time highs in the first half of 2017.


From November 2015 to the first half of 2017, Regeneron formed a giant first-stage base. It was first stage because in January 2016 the stock undercut the 435.52 low of a prior [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), thus [resetting the base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/).


This is a key point. In addition to the head and shoulders, poor action after the [breakout from a late-stage base](https://www.investors.com/research/the-short-side/why-the-late-stage-base-can-be-a-short-sellers-good-friend/) offers the best entry point to sell short. So, why consider Regeneron? Shares had such a monster run since bottoming at 15.02 in 2009, rising more than 3,900% off that low. That's unusual.



Regeneron broke out of its giant base at 489.10 on June 20, 2017, posting three impressive up days in a row in heavy volume. ([Please go to MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) to see historical daily, weekly or monthly charts or to your favorite chart provider.)


Then the rally fizzled. The breakout wound up with an 11% advance at the rally's peak of 543.55. Then it fell 8% below the buy point to around 450.


Given the stock's big long-term move since 2009, the new breakdown from this late-stage base offered an initial short-sale entry.


Regeneron rebounded a bit. Three months later, shares got back up to 477 on Oct. 5, 2017. But a short seller at 450 was never forced to [cut losses at 8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


On a weekly chart, Regeneron offered a second chance to sell short in the week ended Oct. 13; the stock got rejected at the 10-week moving average near 461.


The stock then turned lower after again trying to clear the 10-week moving average near 387 during the first week of January in 2018.


Volume shot higher initially on the Monday of that week. In afternoon trading, turnover was running 10% above usual levels. Regeneron's 50-day average volume at the time counted 845,000 shares.


A short sale at 387 would mean that you must cut the loss at 8% and cover the position by buying back shares near 417. Also keep in mind that in a confirmed uptrend, most short sales have a bigger risk of failure. A breakdown below the recent low of 353.14 would affirm the stock's downtrend. The stock exhibited support around 325 to 350 in 2016 and 2017, so investors should watch that. A 20% profit target means you should cover at 322.50.



The Tarrytown, N.Y., firm pulled off some very nice quarters of rising earnings per share (up 36%, 22%, 48% and 27% in the past four quarters at the time) and revenue (up 10% to 23%). And analysts saw earnings in Q4 2017 jumping a very impressive 48% to $4.49 a share.


But in full-year 2018, analysts expected earnings growth to slow sharply, up just 9% to $16.95 a share. Remember that annual estimates can be conservative.


The stock eventually reached a low of 282 in May 2018, 48% off its 2017 peak of 543.

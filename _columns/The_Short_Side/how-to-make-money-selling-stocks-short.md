You check into Nick Darvas' Casino & Resort and head for the roulette table. After sitting down, you see something unusual.


Three-quarters of the numbers are colored black. Only a quarter are in red. A man dressed in a neat bow tie and golden silk vest asks, "Are you ready to place a wager?"


You want to win. You play the odds. You bet on black.


This imaginary scenario has real-world implications in the stock market.


Three out of four stocks on the Nasdaq and the NYSE typically follow the market's general direction. So, if you want to make money on the short side, conduct your trades when the market is in the early stages of a significant correction.


How much is "significant"?


A bear market — when an index falls 20% or more from its 52-week high — is the most extreme example of a significant decline. Bear markets vary. From the end of 2007 to the spring of 2009, the Nasdaq collapsed 56% over 16 months. But in 1998, during the Russian ruble collapse, the Nasdaq slid 33% in the span of three months.


A bear market is likely due sometime in the near future. Within a year from now, or a couple years? No one exactly knows. That's the nature of the beast. But if you want to learn to spot early signs of trouble, attain two skills. One, identify heavy distribution over a short period of time, even as the market continues to gain ground. Heavy, outright distribution precedes every severe market decline. Use the [Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) column as your 24/7 radar.


Two, keep a finger on the pulse of the market's true leaders, which usually encompass a couple dozen stocks or even more (as seen during the 1999 dot-com bubble). When these stocks crash, you can expect the market to crash as well.


The Big Picture can help you watch the leaders going into free fall. Also use "Stocks On The Move," "Inside the IBD 50," "Smart Table Review" and the intraday market updates on Investors.com to guide you to the action of the leading stocks. IBD also presents fresh short-selling ideas on Leaderboard's [Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/).


A savvy short seller can also make a good short sale even though the market is in a general uptrend. Bull markets experience brief pullbacks, such as the spring of 2012. It was not a bear market, but the S&P 500 did fall 11% over eight weeks from its April peak — one of the most significant declines in the past year and a half.


This is a tricky job. You must show excellent timing and find a stock that made a tremendous move and built numerous bases, then shows a change in character. **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) qualified.


The Chinese web search engine had built four sound bases after the market bottomed in March 2009, rising 403% in the process. When Baidu peaked at 165.96 (adjusted for a 10-for-1 split), it gained 1,551% from its 2009 low.


The stock tried to clear a wide-and-loose base in late March 2012. But by April 4, the market fell into a correction.


During the week ended April 27, Baidu broke down. It crashed through its 10-week moving average in big volume **(1)** and violated the 142.59 entry point. Traders could have covered five weeks later near 114 for a 25% profit.

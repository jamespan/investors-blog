Is making a good short sale or two going to be one of your New Year's resolutions?

  

Such a thought is highly logical given recent market history. Yet, the market can seem to act illogically for a long time.

  

The market's bull run is approaching six years since the bottom of March 2009. That seems illogical, even if the financial system is awash in cash.

  

Some believe the bull market is much shorter. The Nasdaq dived 20.1% in less than 13 weeks in the fall of 2011. That's still more than three years ago. Either way, the powerful bull market is inevitably going to end.

  

Taking profits on stocks on the way up, building a cash hoard, and screening for good short plays open the door to more profits when a market is topping and turning lower. Experience, chart-reading prowess, a willingness to cut losses short and disciplined trading all help you win on the short side.

  

Paying attention to key financial news trends will help a lot. The amazing drop in crude oil prices garnered plenty of headlines last year. Light sweet crude oil has fallen nearly 48% from a late-June high near 101 to 53.27 on Dec. 31.

  

If you spotted the sharp decline in both oil and oil explorer stocks since midsummer, then you had a chance to ride a steep drop in companies such as **Continental Resources** ([CLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLR)), which back in 2012 was part of IBD's Leaderboard.

  

The Oklahoma City-based large cap made a half-hearted breakout from a third-stage base past a 79.72 buy point in puny volume on Aug. 29, then triggered a short-sale entry right below its 10-week moving average just two weeks later. At that moment, Continental also triggered the 8% loss rule.

  

As you hunt for new short plays, use the Leaderboard [Cut List](http://news.investors.com/investing/the-short-side.htm) on the Investors.com home page and read the Jan. 6, 2014, article that detailed the short play by NII Holdings in October 2007.

  

•**Identify "torpedo" sell-offs**. The Feb. 10, 2014, [column](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/020714-689340-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm) highlighted multiple weeks of severe selling in **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) in the second half of 2013.

  

•**Know when to cover**. A good short sale is only good after you close the position. Don't let greed stand in the way. As **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) proved in late 2012, covering the position when profits rise to 20% to 25% is wise. (See the May 5, 2014, [story](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-short-side/050214-699443-how-to-sell-stocks-short.htm).)

  

•**Look for past exceptional runs**. Don't try to score on mediocre winners. (Read more in the July 7, 2014, column.)

  

•**Pay attention to volume**. The thinner the stock, the more likely you could get chased out by funds and exchange specialists who are aware of the stock's level of short open interest.

  

•**Pay attention to the market**. Its direction is ultra-important. A correction can help make shorting a lot more pleasant. (See the Nov. 3, 2014, article.)

  

•**Do IBD ratings matter**? The Dec. 1 column discusses how the ratings may vary with the sort of chart pattern developing.

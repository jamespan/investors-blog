Rotations in the stock market, like we saw this past week, aren't easy to navigate. But they can offer opportunity. Freeport-McMoRan and other metal ore miners were some of the first stocks to show their strength and made for good [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) setups.




Swing Trading Example: FCX Stock
--------------------------------


**Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) holds a special place for IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) product. [FCX stock was one of the first trade ideas](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/industry-group-moves-reveal-stock-opportunities/) after SwingTrader's launch back in April 2016. It was one of our early introductions to subscribers on the power of pullbacks along with a little stock called **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) that was trading around 30.


Move forward a few years and the copper play is still able to deliver stunning results very quickly. Whether a pullback or a breakout, we are generally sticking with stocks that have already demonstrated power. Freeport-McMoRan demonstrated that superbly in November before starting its latest consolidation **(1)**.

Throughout December, FCX stock traded tightly until a strong jump at the end of the year **(1)**. The short-term moving averages were stacked on top of each other. When the stock started moving shortly after the session open on Dec. 30, we sent out an alert on FCX stock to subscribers **(2)**.


It was also worth noting that the tight action kept the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) in good position to break out to new highs at the same time as the stock rallied **(3)**.


The power in the stock that day was surprising. Within hours, we were already past our 5% profit goal and we took one-third profits. We usually don't take profits on the same day as we add a stock. Our goal is swing trading, not day trading. However, when the move is that strong, it's worth locking some of it in.


Metals Show What They're Made Of
--------------------------------


The strength didn't stop there. After a brief pause, FCX stock was knocking on the 10% profit-goal door a few days later and we took another one-third of the position off **(4)**. But Freeport wasn't alone.


Like in past moves, FCX stock had the support of an industry group move. Consider that the metal ore miners went from a rank of No. 79 in the middle of last year to No. 3 this week out of IBD's 197 Industry Groups.


But it's also worth noting that the market leader was getting extended. As the climb continued, one would naturally have to ask: When do I lock in my final profits?


Selling Into Strength
---------------------


After jumping another 6% on Jan. 6, we could see that FCX stock was getting extended **(5)**. After booking the majority of profits in a stock, we will at times switch to using a decisive close below the 10-day line as a place to lock in the remainder of the profits. In this case, that would give up a lot of gains.


Instead, like we did with **Peloton Interactive** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) a couple of weeks ago, [we sold into strength](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/peloton-stock-gave-a-quick-powerful-swing-trading-ride/). The next day, FCX stock jumped another 5% during the day **(6)**. We were looking at a 25% gain from our initial entry in just over a week. It's easy to hope for more but we took our final exit on the strength.


There is certainly the possibility of an opportunity cost should the stock go higher. But locking in the gains when you have them sets you up for your next trade and ability to compound the gain. And there's always the chance that FCX stock will give us another shot.

With the strong market reversal Aug. 29, it's a good time to revisit what reversals look like in individual stocks. The benefit of reversals? They provide a way to purchase shares for a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) at a lower price than a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-stock-breakout-strategies-have-familiar-rules/). In fact, buying the reversal can often get you a 5% profit by the time the stock hits its breakout price.


As a reminder, we aren't looking for beaten-down stocks at their lows. We want pullbacks in stocks that are otherwise showing strength.


Ideally, a leading stock will retreat in modest volume for a few days and then find enthusiastic support, causing it to reverse powerfully. That change in character creates a buying opportunity.


Take **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)), which showed a dramatic reversal Nov. 4 on the heaviest volume in three months **(1)**. The company reported earnings the day before, beating estimates by 40%, and the stock closed well near the top of its range, but not above the previous day's high at 83.92. We waited for a continuation of the strength to confirm the reversal.


Arista was added to IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) the next trading day as it surpassed 83.92 and got back above its 10-day line **(2)**. Using the low of the reversal day as the stop loss, at 79.05, meant we would be risking a 6% loss, much higher than desired. In that situation, you can tighten your stop loss, which carries its own risk of stopping you out unnecessarily. Or you can reduce your position size to keep the dollars risked constant. The position-size adjustment requires a little math, or you could use the [Position Size Calculator](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-can-help-balance-risk-and-reward/) on SwingTrader. In this case, we adjusted our stop loss to 82.13 after noticing it as an identifiable area of support on the intraday chart.


After the presidential election shocked the market, Arista fell considerably, breaching a number of its moving averages: the 5-, 10-, and 50-day lines, but it held above the stop loss **(3)**. It righted itself by the end of the day, closing back above all three moving averages and demonstrating why we usually act on moving-average-line breaches at the close rather than intraday.


Arista ended up being a slower mover from there but eventually hit a 5% profit goal **(4)**. This would often lead to selling just half the position, but the stock was getting resistance at 89, had already been held for 10 days and was reversing off highs.


The sell meant we missed a 7% jump the next day as [news broke of import approval](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-rival-arista-networks-gets-import-green-light-stock-rises/) coming from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. While it sailed past its 10% profit goal **(5)**, holding it longer wouldn't have helped much. The first decisive close below the 5-day moving average **(6)** happened just below the 10% profit goal.

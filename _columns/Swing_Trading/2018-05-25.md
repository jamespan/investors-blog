Taking profits on the way up is a key part of a [swing-trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategy. The biggest problem? The fear of missing out on an even bigger gain. If you can train yourself to take that fear out of the decision, you can stack a number of gains together for a significant boost to your portfolio. **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)) provides a recent swing trade example.




Swing Trading Strategy Example: American Eagle Outfitters
---------------------------------------------------------


The move in American Eagle Outfitters started with a bullish [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) off the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) **(1)**. A bullish reversal can signal that a short-term pullback may be shifting directions. When looking for reversals, we aren't trying to catch the bottom on beaten down stocks. Rather, these are stocks in uptrends already showing relative strength vs. the market. American Eagle Outfitters had a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 94. That means, despite its 12% pullback, it was in the top 6% of stocks in terms of price performance over the last 12 months.


Volume was above average on the bounce from the 50-day line and it joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 20.72. Two days later and it approached our 5% profit goal **(2)**. We took half profits. Taking half profits on the way up allows you to lock in early gains while still participating if the rally continues. We also typically raise our stop. There is no reason to let a trade turn negative after you have a gain around 5%. We raised the stop to a 1% profit from our entry, in this case 20.93. With half profits booked and a raised stop, you help ensure a profitable trade.


For American Eagle Outfitters, the gains continued to stretch and four days after our entry, the stock hit its 10% profit goal **(3)**. With five days up in a row, a break is normal and expected. The market also had a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) a few days prior so locking in the full gain seemed prudent.


Benefits Of Taking Profits Quickly
----------------------------------


Taking profits when they come that quickly can give your money some velocity. String together a number of gains back-to-back and your portfolio can turn in spectacular performance. It compresses the power of compounding into a shorter period. Of course, there's a trade-off. The stock can continue without you. You could be compounding your gain in one trade rather than many. That's the goal of position trading. The benefit of position trading is you can see some big numbers in your individual trades and reduce your transaction costs.


In the case of American Eagle Outfitters, the stock did go up from our exit. Briefly. Just a few days later it took a 2.7% hit, putting the price back under our final exit **(4)**. Our swing-trading strategy of taking profits helped optimize our gains for the short period of a week.

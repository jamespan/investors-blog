This has been a tough week as a stock market correction took hold. On IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), we sat out the carnage because of profit taking in stocks like TNDM stock on the way up. Here's how our swing trading rules got us out on the top day.




Diabetes Stocks Trio Give Multiple Profit Opportunities
-------------------------------------------------------


[Innovative technologies in diabetes management and treatment](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-device-companies-ignite-revolution-diabetes-treatment/) translated into opportunities in stocks. On [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&src=A00433A&refcode=pdsoc%7Cggl%7Cibdlive%7C2019%7C11%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C985802&intcode=invstcntnartcls|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|682843), we've talked about the trio of diabetes plays, **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)), **Tandem Diabetes** ([TNDM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TNDM)), and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)). With SwingTrader, we played two with great success.


PODD stock joined SwingTrader near the start of the year **(1)** and stayed on until the end of January **(2)**. [PODD stock moved 10.7% from our initial entry to final exit.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/podd-stock-reversal-gave-early-swing-trading-entry/) Part of the reason for the exit, was an extended market that started to feel some pressure from  Covid-19 virus fears. We did a lot of selling before going into that weekend at the end of January. Selling before the weekend served us well in February too. But we still had some nice gains in stocks like TNDM stock.


**Swing Trading Example: TNDM Stock**
-------------------------------------


TNDM stock showed a short consolidation after a previous [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/breakouts-buying-stocks-swing-trades/) and was reversing its slight downtrend **(3)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) moved to recent new highs that day and trading volume spiked above average. The market was also back in new high territory, as coronavirus cases started to slow. With those elements in place, TNDM stock joined SwingTrader at 77.10.

Two days later and [we took half profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) on TNDM stock when it blasted through our 5% profit goal **(4)**. Another two days later and we hit our 10% profit goal **(5)**. With the gains coming so quickly, we sent an alert to subscribers that we would give the stock more room to run.


Taking Profits Ahead Of Stock Market Correction
-----------------------------------------------


When you have a profit cushion that quickly it gives you greater flexibility to handle the trade. But you still have a balancing act. You want to get as much profit as you can without giving up the profit that you already have. With the market still looking extended, we decided to keep our stops tight. As an early alert, we considered an undercut of the previous day's low a potential signal. That didn't happen for TNDM stock until Feb. 20 **(6)**. We sent a profit taking alert to subscribers when TNDM stock was trading at 87.80. As explained in last week's column, we had an [expectation breaker](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-expectation-breakers-what-to-do-when-stock-market-throws-you-curveball/) in the market and [were looking to sell into the weekend anyway](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-fears-spark-another-weekend-retreat/). We removed six stocks that day from SwingTrader and only kept our position in the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miner ETF ([GDXJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDXJ)).


Tandem stock looked better at the close as the market improved. But the next day it fell more than 2% with a decisive close below its 5-day moving average line **(7)**. It was the first time it closed below the line since we put it on SwingTrader.


As the next week unfolded, most stocks fell hard and TNDM stock wasn't spared. By midweek, it was back at near our inital entry **(8)**. Our profit taking resulted in the stock's removal on its top day. We don't expect things to always come out that nicely. But rules will get you out close enough to the top day often enough, they are worth following.

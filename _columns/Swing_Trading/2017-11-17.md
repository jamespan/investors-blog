As the old saying goes, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. That is certainly the philosophy of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) and flies in the face of the position trader's adage, "let your profits run."


First, understanding the market you are in goes a long way in determining when to [take your profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/dont-be-greedy-take-what-the-market-will-give-you/). Most of this year, when we hit our 5% profit goal, we take half profits. Usually we try to let the remaining shares extend gains to a 10% profit goal, but not as often lately. Since rallies and corrections in the market have tended to be short, that stretch to 10% hasn't happened quickly and we have often booked profits earlier.


Take a recent trade in **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)). The stock has superior fundamentals and at its last earnings report **(1)** saw a huge jump of 25%. An option strategy on the earnings, noted in our [Earnings Preview](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/earnings-watch-why-call-options-might-make-sense-for-polaris-amgen/) column, provided a way to profit from the move while minimizing risk. The stock pulled back for nearly two weeks but held the bulk of the spectacular one-day gain, setting up a potential swing trade. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on Nov. 2 as it [broke out](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) above its trading range **(2)** on the heaviest volume since the earnings report.


Three days later and we took half profits after Atlassian hit its 5% profit goal **(3)**. At this point, we are usually looking to stretch to a 10% profit goal for the remaining shares, always mindful of market strength as a backdrop for our expectations.


When the Nasdaq composite dropped 1.5% intraday on Nov. 9, it seemed prudent to take profits on the remaining shares **(4)**. The market looked extended and, as we've seen all too frequently, quick drops can wipe out weeks of progress in a single day. Just as you wouldn't go looking for extra birds in a bush if you thought a bear was in the vicinity, neither do we push for more profits when the market is threatening to take away the gains we have.


The worries seemed unfounded by the end of the day as the market closed near its peak and Atlassian closed back above its 5-day moving average after being below it intraday **(4)**. But notice the action in the stock over the next five days. It flattened and hugged the 5-day moving average, jostling above and below it from day to day. We booked a 4.8% profit when averaging both exit prices and each close was right around the level of our exits. Even when the market shot up Thursday, Atlassian closed up, but ultimately right around the same level **(5)**.


Being out of the trade, with profit in hand, protected us from the risk of holding longer and having those profits disappear. In this case, the promise of more profits hasn't materialized yet so we didn't miss out on anything. And since the stock has been trading tightly, it could offer us another opportunity to snatch another profit with a new setup.

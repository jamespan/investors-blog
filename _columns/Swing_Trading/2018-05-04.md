A stock market correction can make investing prospects seem bleak. Your [batting average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/) suffers and it's hard to feel in step. But don't give up. Stocks showing relative strength during these times deserve special attention. They can bring the best [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) profits when the market firms up.




A return of volatility has already made the start of 2018 more challenging than 2017. January continued to build on the strength of the prior year but then things shifted. February saw more than a 10% correction in the Nasdaq composite. March was back to new highs. By the start of April, another correction of over 10% was underway. With the back-and-forth, making progress hasn't been easy.


The fact that 2017 had no 10% stock market corrections was unusual. So, it may be helpful to revisit the stock market corrections of 2016 for insight to the current market conditions — and a ray of hope.


The beginning of 2016 had its share of turbulence. January started with a rally failure and by February the Nasdaq composite languished nearly 20% off its high. A [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) in February offered a slow start for growth stocks initially. Still, there were plenty of successful swing trading opportunities by the time [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) launched its beta version in March that year. **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **TAL Education** ([TAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAL)), and **Silicon Motion** ([SIMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SIMO)) were among those early winners.


Relative Strength Identifies A Winner
-------------------------------------


The strong rally into April hit resistance just under 5000. Soon enough, the index was back below its 50-day moving average line and our batting average on SwingTrader started to suffer. But, as the stock market firmed, the stocks with spectacular relative strength stuck out. Semiconductor stock **MaxLinear** ([MXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MXL)) was one of them.


MaxLinear broke out of a [base-on-base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-use-the-base-on-base-pattern-as-springboard-for-big-profits/) structure with double its average volume on May 16 **(1)**. Its move to new highs occurred while the market was still recovering. That pushed its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) to new highs sharply **(1)** and earned it a spot on SwingTrader.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Relative Strength isn't just for swing trading. It was a factor for IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/) in picking **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) as a winner.*

Though the stock didn't go straight up immediately, the 5-day moving average line easily contained its drops. By May 23, MaxLinear hit its 5% profit goal and we took half profits on the trade **(2)**. As the market's strength grew, the semiconductor stock continued to pile on gains. The 10% profit goal hit on May 31 and we exited the remaining shares **(3)**. The Nasdaq composite approached its prior resistance level of 5000 around the same time.


[Taking profits on the way up](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-stock-profits-on-the-way-up-to-compound-gains/) didn't get us out at the top. It usually doesn't. But it did save us the heartache of a nearly 20% correction in MaxLinear that transpired over the next month. More importantly, stocks showing relative strength when things look bleak can be your key to profits when the eventual market turn comes.

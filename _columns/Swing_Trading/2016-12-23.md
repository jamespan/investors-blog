Nimbleness is one of the hallmark traits of a [swing trader](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). But quick moves in and out of stocks also require a higher level of attention to the markets, not just for opportunities but also to protect profits or prevent losing capital. That leaves many would-be swing traders in a conflict if their jobs don't allow for constant monitoring of markets.


A new tool launched last week may be able to help. IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) now has an app available for download on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.investors.swing.trader) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swingtrader-by-ibd/id1132694075?mt=8) mobile devices.


Some of the more prominent features of the app are instant push notifications for your mobile device so you are aware of buy and sell alerts, as well as custom notifications, wherever you are. Custom notifications provide a way for the markets team to communicate with subscribers on ways to handle positions. Whether it's taking half profits on the way up and letting the remaining shares run, raising stop losses, or other alterations to strategy, swing trading requires flexibility and that's relayed to subscribers with custom notifications. Once you get the alert, you can easily link to the trade setup, goal, and stop loss analysis as well as a marked up chart, all optimized for mobile devices.

With that information, you can quickly make the decision to place a trade. Reviewing ideas is also easy with a swipe feature that allows you to quickly scan through current names on SwingTrader, both active and [watchlist](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/watch-list-keeps-you-engaged-in-tough-markets/) names. New ideas within the last 24 hours, shorts and option plays are all clearly marked.


The Recent Alerts tab provides access to all the alerts sent over the past five days, just to make sure you didn't miss anything. These include buy alerts, sell alerts and custom notifications.


The transparency of the service is also available on the app. All past trades are available for subscribers to review, including the entry and exit dates and prices, as well as a snapshot of what the chart and analysis looked like at the time the trade was removed.


The [Market Action analysis](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/using-the-market-as-your-guide-for-stock-positions/) is also available on the app, giving a quick synopsis of where the market is currently, with a focus on its short-term trend. That can be a useful gauge to determine aggressiveness in number of positions and their sizes. When the trend is sideways, less trading and smaller position sizes should be used. A [position-size calculator](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-can-help-balance-risk-and-reward/) is available on all current trades to help quickly calculate position sizes based on your acceptable risk levels.

Keeping losses as small as possible is a key tenet of swing trading or any type of stock trading. A recent stock trade in **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) shows a simple trick to keep those losses small.




Swing Trade Example: PayPal Stock
---------------------------------


Payment processing giant PayPal was a recent swing trade that didn't work out. Still, there is something to learn in losses as well as profits. In this case, scaling out of PayPal in two separate sells reduced the damage.


IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) put the stock on as a current trade March 14 as it [broke out](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) in volume well above average **(1)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) also got to new high ground before the price **(1)**. PayPal could have easily produced a 5% return by getting to its previous high. With an early [base count](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/counting-bases-is-a-crucial-skill-in-playing-long-winning-stock-rallys/) and the stock's proven ability to make a strong move, it had the potential to return even more.


That didn't come to pass on this stock trade. The next day saw early strength fade into a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) day **(2)**. Though volume was lower than the breakout, it was an early indicator that the trade was in danger of failing. SwingTrader removed half the position at the time out of caution.

In this case, the remaining shares exited two days later when PayPal gapped down at the trading session's open **(3)**.  Market weakness was a contributing factor to the gap down as [IBD switched its market outlook](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/sp-500-breaks-support-at-50-day-line-but-top-growth-stocks-suffer-minimal-damage/) to under pressure that day. The early warning reduced the damage and the stock fell another 5% from our average exit price over the next few days.


Have An Exit Strategy Before You Enter Stock Trades
---------------------------------------------------


Before entering a trade, you should already have your exit planned, the line in the sand that will trigger you into action. With breakouts and [reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/), that line in the sand will usually be the low of your entry day. For PayPal, the low on the entry day was 80.64. If the stock can't stay above that level, it usually means you've made a mistake in your analysis. Sure, they can recover and you may kick yourself for not having faith. However, further weakness happens often enough to be cautious. At the very least, the stock probably needs more time.


It's important to remember that not every swing trade will be favorable. And that's OK. Even being right half the time can be very profitable — as long as you keep the size of your losses small. When losses get too large they cause two problems. First, the losses detract from your winning positions. One large loss can wipe out a handful of your smaller profits or cancel out the effect of a big winner. Second, the large loss can leave you with less capital to work with on the next trade. That can include your psychological capital. Oversized losses can make you more hesitant to take advantage of future opportunities.


Cut Losses Quicker When Possible
--------------------------------


Having a set price to watch for is a good first step. You also need the flexibility to recognize early warning signals that a swing trade may be heading south. [Breaks below moving averages](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/), bearish reversals, or just a [lack of progress](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/when-swing-trades-stop-trending-move-on-to-next-stock/) can all foreshadow problems ahead. It's a balancing act. Cut a loss too quickly and you might find a small wiggle causing you to miss out on a larger gain.


Selling half the position is a suitable compromise when faced with early warning signs of trouble. If the weakness is temporary, you still participate in the move should the stock come roaring back. On the other hand, scaling out early reduces the loss if the weakness continues. Trade decisions don't have to be all or nothing. Breaking a swing trade into half positions on the way up or the way down can serve to maximize profits while minimizing losses. The early sell in PayPal was half the percentage loss of the final sell. It turned what would have been a 2.6% loss into a loss under 2%. The difference may seem small, but practiced over many trades those differences can make a big impact.

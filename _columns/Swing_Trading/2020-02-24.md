Covid-19 coronavirus fears continue to weigh on the stock market. Going into each weekend, investors hold their breath that headlines don't start a stock market correction. This is where a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) strategy can help. [Taking profits quickly on the way up](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-profits-early-is-a-key-tenet-of-swing-trades/) reduces exposure naturally. Combine that with rigorous trimming of losses and you can quickly adjust your exposure to the prevailing market conditions.




The Risk Of Raising Cash Ahead Of Stock Market Correction
---------------------------------------------------------


Since the stock market rally started in October, the Nasdaq composite trended nicely above its 21- and [50-day moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). The spread of coronavirus brought up concerns about the economic impact, especially in China. But IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) came out largely unscathed due to reduced exposure at appropriate times. Our movement in and out of the stock market isn't perfect but is still instructive.


On Jan. 24, we sent an alert to SwingTrader subscribers noting the outside day closing near the lows and near the 10-day moving average **(1)**. We suggested caution and moved our market outlook to sideways trend. We only had three trades on our current list, two of which were half positions. With a full position size of 12.5%, it translated to roughly 26% exposure with some appreciation in the positions.


By the end of the next week, we reduced our exposure more, completely taking profits where we had them and keeping losses small where we could **(2)**. The S&P 500 ended the month negative while we locked in strong gains. Our biggest risk going to cash is that a gap-up would put us behind to start February. That's exactly what happened. On Feb. 4 the Nasdaq composite launched to new high territory **(3)**. We were quick to react and built exposure back up so that by the end of the day, we had seven positions and near full exposure. It's fine to go to cash to avoid a stock market correction but you have to be willing to change your opinion if you're wrong.

Weekend Retreats For Investors
------------------------------


We continued adding stocks but we also took profits on the way up. As another week came to a close we saw another decline in the stock market **(4)**. But our picks performed well overall. Your portfolio can be a valuable indicator of market health or at least whether you are in the right stocks. It allowed us to hold our exposure steady unlike the prior two Fridays **(1)** and **(2)**.


During the following week, we increased exposure and added stocks to a high of 11 with a couple of those at half positions **(5)**. As the week came to a close, we found ourselves naturally lighter by harvesting gains on the way up **(6)**. It set us up going into a holiday weekend with just seven stocks, two of which were half positions due to profit taking. Roughly a 68% invested level. That's enough to keep our participation level high but still not going into the weekend with heavy exposure.


Another Friday Falls
--------------------


We continued to outpace the stock market but were mindful of the indexes getting extended again. With coronavirus cases affecting stock market action, we continued ahead cautiously. After four tight daily closes, the market gapped up strongly but we still tempered our buying **(7)**. Of our eight positions, two were half positions due to profit taking and one was the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miner ETF ([GDXJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDXJ)) that was acting as somewhat of a hedge. Its cousin the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF ([GDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDX)) was featured as [IBD's Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/gold-stock-etf-gdx-buy-point-as-coronavirus-boosts-gold-price/).


As the stock market fell sharply on Thursday **(8)**, we reduced our exposure dramatically down to just two stocks, one a half position. In an alert to subscribers we noted that undercutting the low of the four tight closes was an [expectation breaker](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-expectation-breakers-what-to-do-when-stock-market-throws-you-curveball/). By the close, however, things didn't look so bad. Fears of a stock market correction seemed overblown as the stock market rallied and pared losses considerably. We felt that it warranted increasing exposure. But it didn't happen. As we looked for stocks, nothing seemed right. This can be an important tell and precursor to a stock market correction. The setups dry up. Rather than force exposure, we decided to keep the low exposure and see how Friday unfolded.


Things got uglier the next day **(9)**. With the Nasdaq composite closing down 1.8%, our light exposure helped. And considering the gold miner exposure, we were actually positive for the day and continued to take profits. Going into the weekend, we were light again with just the one half-position in the gold miners ETF. Our plan for Monday was to see how the Nasdaq composite acted. A cross below the 21-day moving average would prove beneficial as our light exposure would work in our favor. A bounce from the line would mean that we would have to aggressively add so that we didn't get left behind.

Stock Market Correction Fears Increase
--------------------------------------


Fears over the [potential economic impact of the coronavirus](https://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-dives-coronavirus-upends-outlook-fed-2020-election-us-economy/) got worse over the weekend as countries outside of China saw spikes in cases. The Nasdaq composite opened down 4% and traded below both its 21- and 50-day moving average lines **(10)**. It's starting to look more like a potential [vertical violation.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-look-to-past/) That's where a violent move below moving averages stunts progress for a few months. You might also find that the first one or two [follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) aren't successful after this signal. Nasdaq charts worthy of study include May 2010, August 2011, August 2015, January 2016 and October 2018.


Our strategy will be to lay low if that is the case. The damage may have already been done so shorting isn't our focus at this point, that could change if the lows continue. If headlines show the coronavirus spread may be contained, that could spark a rally, as could a Fed announcement on looser monetary policy. A move back above the 21-day moving average line will be our signal that our buying should step up. Otherwise, we'll be taking small tries here and there if the setups look right. Otherwise, sitting on our hands may be the best way to protect the gains that we've earned so far this year.

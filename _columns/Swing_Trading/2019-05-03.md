Earnings season can bring about numerous opportunities as well as pitfalls. For swing trading, taking profits ahead of earnings is a tactic often employed to balance risk and reward. Amazon stock provides a recent example.




Amazon Stock Sets Up
--------------------


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) suffered a 36% correction to close out 2018. That's not something we want to sit through. Why take an unnecessarily large drawdown when you can just buy the stock back when it rights itself? By the beginning of April, Amazon stock was well on its way on the right side of a [base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/). We added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as it made a strong move back into the upper third of its base **(1)**. By that point Amazon demonstrated sufficient strength and reestablished itself in a solid uptrend. Its [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) was the highest possible at the time, with a 99, and Amazon.com looked like it could recapture its trillion-dollar market cap. That would translate to a 13% move from our entry. If we could just grab a portion of that in a short time it would be worth it.


We usually like to take half profits at our first target goal of 5%. With many of our swing trades, that can happen very quickly. Even in just a day, like a [recent swing trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/twitter-stock-earnings-breakaway-gap/) in **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)). After three weeks, Amazon stock was up 4% with steady progress. Since its earnings report was just around the corner, there was a decision to make. As a rule, we don't hold stocks through earnings. It's too easy for a poor report to take away profits, or worse, take away capital. Many stocks also make little progress in the week leading up to earnings as investors adopt a wait-and-see approach.


Taking Profits Ahead Of Earnings
--------------------------------


We decided to take our full profits a week ahead of earnings and booked a 4% profit **(2)**. As the stock market was also looking extended, it seemed like a prudent idea. [Being flexible with your price target](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/price-target-flexibility-when-to-sell-stocks/) based on conditions is sound practice. The next day, Amazon stock hit the 5% profit goal **(3)** and stretched its gains further once its earnings were out **(4)**. You could look at the extra 3% in gains and question the sell decision. But in order to achieve the extra 3% gain, most of which came *after* its earnings report, you need to look at the risk as well. You can't just focus on the reward part of the equation. If you didn't sell at the top and earnings didn't excite, you could easily have wiped away your profits and then some.


In fact, Amazon stock pulled back over the next four days **(5)** falling right back to the level or our exit **(2)**. And it's not like Amazon stock is going away. On Friday, the price got reignited along with the market, setting the stock up for another potential move. Another benefit of Amazon stock is our familiarity. We've had a [similar trade in Amazon stock ahead of earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) on SwingTrader. It was also one of our conviction trades on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/), with a trade spanning over a year in 2017 and 2018 and it's also a current member of Leaderboard. That familiarity can help manage expectations and keep you in sync with any character changes in the stock.

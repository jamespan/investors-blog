Sometimes in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) you find yourself selling a stock that looks fine as a regular position trade. The short-term nature of swing trading means you cannot afford to sit through problematic moves that would be acceptable for a position trade. That was a situation recently faced with Costco stock.




Swing Trading Example: Costco Stock
-----------------------------------


Discount retailers have been an area of strength in the stock market lately. That was a particular attraction of **Costco Wholesale** ([COST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COST)). On Oct. 4, a day after its earnings announcement, Costco stock followed up on a bounce from its 50-day moving average line **(1)**. We put it on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 291.06 shortly after it crossed the high of the previous day. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) wasn't at new highs but was still strong **(2),**especially considering the stock was still more than 5% off its price highs. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-speaks-volumes-for-trades/) also showed strong buying support **(3)**.


The move up for Costco stock was slow and steady. Not the usual desired characteristic we choose for swing trading stocks. But with a higher volatility in the stock market, as measured by the [CBOE Volatility Index](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-vix-can-help-confirm-market-bottoms/) (the "VIX"), a slower stock in your portfolio can help keep things steady. At the time of the entry, the [stock market was also facing an inflection point](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-or-new-rally/) of a potential short-term trend change.


Bearish Reversals Aren't All Created Equal
------------------------------------------


Last week's column covered [bearish reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) as a signal to take profits. But what about the bearish reversals that started in Costco stock on Oct. 10 and kept coming day after day **(4)**? A few distinctions are worth mentioning. First, wider spreads from the high to low of the trading range tend to be more indicative of trouble brewing. These reversals were relatively tight.


Also, the stock was still off its highs. When reversing from new-high territory it speaks to a stock that can't maintain demand at that price. For a stock making its way up, sometimes you will get weaker holders that are just trying to recoup the losses they had from their previous purchases. In this case, we held Costco stock through the action.


After a quick shakeout with support at the 10-day moving average **(5)** we thought we were on our way to a [5% profit goal.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) We got close. At 4.7%, Costco stock started hitting resistance and reversed **(6)**. This time the spread between the high and low was wider and the stock was nearly at new highs. It closed below the five-day moving average line but not decisively, about a quarter of a percent below it. So we gave it an extra day.


Sell Or Hold Costco Stock?
--------------------------


Things got weaker. The distance below its five-day moving average grew the next day as it also breached its 10-day moving average line **(7)**. We didn't wait for the [1% profit level as an exit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) for the trade and locked in a 2.4% gain instead.


As mentioned last week, a bearish reversal isn't always a death sentence. Weakness may follow but be temporary. Though shallow enough to be a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/flat-base-stock-dollar-tree-breakout/), Costco stock also has the look of a cup base. The pullback just added a handle. The low volume during the pullback so far **(8)**, is typical action of a proper base.


That thesis is compelling enough to justify a hold for Costco stock as a position trade, though it was a sell as a swing trade. It's the tack used by [IBD's Leaderboard, which has Costco stock as a full position](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). For swing trading, there is no need to hold while a handle forms. By sitting out we reduce the risk of a worse exit on a shakeout in the handle. We can always buy it back for another swing.

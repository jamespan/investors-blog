Most investors associate a bear market with the pain of dramatic losses. But there is also the specter of [sideways movement](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-to-navigate-a-sideways-market/) that deserves consideration. While not as dramatic, a stock market tossing to and fro can cause just as much damage. The result can easily put you out of phase with the market by selling at lows when continued pain seems inevitable. Or buying at highs right before a short rally loses steam in a market searching for direction. How can you get it right?




Distribution Days Do Damage
---------------------------


First, understand that not all markets are created equal. They each have their own challenges, but of primary importance is whether there is a discernible trend. You can exploit even a short-term trend with swift swing trades. But a market that seems to change direction every few days is tougher. Small losses taken over and over can do just as much damage as a bear market. It's a death by a thousand cuts that whittles away at your capital.


This week's action in the stock market in response to the rekindled trade war provides a good example. The Nasdaq composite reached its high of 8176 at the end of April **(1)**, after surpassing the 8133 high of August. Over the next 10 days, eight of them showed losses. Shifting to the lower part of the accompanying chart, the trading volume increased compared with the prior day on the down days. Each time it happened on a significant price move down, it triggered a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) **(D)**.


One distribution day by itself isn't bad. Persistent distribution, or clustered distribution within a week or two, usually indicates trouble. What's not clear is how bad things could get. It could be a full-blown bear market or just a minor pullback, but usually the progress will cease. In this case, five distribution days hit the index in the span of 10 days. In contrast, the volume came in lower on the two gains **(2** and **3)**. Volume was also lower when the index made a new high **(1)**.


Support At Moving Average Is Bear Market Defense
------------------------------------------------


A useful line in your arsenal of analysis is the moving average line. Most position trades can last a few months or approach a year in duration. That makes the 50- or 200-day moving average lines a good gauge. For swing trades, and their shorter holding period of a couple weeks, [the five- or 10-day moving averages are more relevant](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/).

As the Nasdaq stacked distribution, it was reassuring that it found support at its 50-day moving average line for two consecutive days **(3)**. But the [drop below the 50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) in heavy volume was cause for concern **(4)**. It looked more like a "[vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-bearish-market-outlook/)," a slice through moving averages that tends to need more time to repair. In many cases, you will see the first couple of [follow-through days fail](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/) and months where progress is difficult. Regardless of whether we go into a bear market, you can lose ground in your portfolio by overtrading in such an unfavorable environment.


What To Do Now?
---------------


The immediate rebound might have made the concern over the trade war seem overblown. After three days up, the Nasdaq composite was right back above its 50-day moving average line **(5)**. But that day had some cracks. It closed well off its highs and showed short-term resistance at its 10-day moving average. Things worsened the following day **(6)** as the indexes lost ground in the final hour and put both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite back below their 50-day moving averages.


On the plus side, leading stocks have still shown pockets of strength. What's required from here is flexibility and daily attention. If the stock market shrugs off the weakness and makes progress to new highs, you might find you don't participate in the full move. That's OK. Right now, the risk associated with sideways trading or even a bear market is greater and needs to be respected. Protecting capital with limited trading is the course of action while the weakness persists.

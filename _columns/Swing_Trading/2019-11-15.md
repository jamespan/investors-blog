Selling into strength isn't easy. You often feel like you're leaving money on the table. So how did we handle swing trading Microsoft stock?




Swing Trading Example: Microsoft Stock
--------------------------------------


The trillion-dollar market cap of **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) might seem too large for much of a move. But Microsoft stock is looking at a more than 40% move in 2019, well above the performance of the S&P 500. And it's given multiple opportunities for entries along the way.


With swing trading, the better your entry, the better your results. For Microsoft stock, the recent action showed resistance around 140 **(1).** If you follow that price back even further, you'll find that area served as resistance multiple times. When Microsoft stock cleared that area **(2)** a couple of days after its earnings report, we added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 140.84. This gave us an edge over waiting until it cleared the previous high of 142.37.


The early entry also gave us an edge when a positive news item came out. The Department of Defense awarded Microsoft a $10 billion contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project over **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). It showed investors that [Amazon Web Services didn't have a stranglehold on the competition, after all](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-competition-will-heat-up-2020-idc-says/). Microsoft could successfully compete. The stock jumped 2.5% on the news **(3)** and immediately gave us a healthy cushion in the position.


You've Got Your Profit, Now What?
---------------------------------


There wasn't much movement in the stock over the next week. But, it also didn't do anything wrong. In fact, Microsoft stock held the [five-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) in a very orderly way. When it crossed into new high territory **(4)**, it looked poised to continue its move.


A few days later, we reached [our 5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) **(5)**. Normally, this is a place where we take half profits and [raise our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/). It was a legitimate strategy with Microsoft stock as well. Certainly as a position trade, the cushion allows you greater flexibility to give the stock room to run.


But, we went a different way. With Microsoft extended, we decided to sell into strength. Our goal in swing trading is for short-term gains. This trade was already two-weeks old. Make no mistake, selling into strength can be tough. It's very easy to feel like you're leaving money on the table and often times you do. However, you can always move that money to other opportunities that might be on their way up while the extended stock consolidates gains. It can be a way to maximize the use of your money and the potential for profit.

Reversal days are a great way to take advantage of pullbacks in a stock's overall uptrend. The early buy point allows you to build a profit cushion before a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/). It also provides a clear signal of failure when it doesn't work out. **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) had two recent examples of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) success.




To be clear, when looking for reversal days, we aren't trying to buy a stock at its bottom. Some of the best swing trading opportunities come from stocks that show a temporary pullback in a powerful uptrend. You'll find most examples are above their 50- and 200-day moving average lines. The trend lines also tend to be moving up themselves.


We don't try to anticipate the change in trend by buying on the way down. Rather we wait for a reversal day to signal that the stock is shifting gears and seeing a return of strength. Often that will include a wider bar than recent activity, a move to near-term lows and then strong evidence of buying support that pushes the stock near its peak for the trading day. Ideally, the price action confirms the strength by closing above the high of the previous day and [volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) comes in strong. We usually like to see the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) in new high territory for breakouts, but with reversals it's not expected.


How do you know when it isn't working? A breach of the reversal day low is a clear indication the stock's pullback isn't over. If it's going to work it will usually require more time. Between the extra time and the risk of the downtrend continuing, the stock should be sold. It's signaling weakness.


Reversal Days In Match Group Stock
----------------------------------


In March, Match Group stock exhibited a classic reversal pattern that preceded a short-term move of more than 10%. The stock had a 31% upward move from a breakout at the start of the year and gave back just over 10% at the lows of the reversal day **(1)**. The reversal day was classic. It was an outside day, or bullish engulfing day. That's where the day's high is higher than the previous day and the low is also lower. Not only did Match close in positive territory, it also closed near the top of its trading range. Finally, volume was well above average and one of the highest of the prior two weeks **(1)**. We added it to SwingTrader on the reversal day.


Match Group stock got within a penny of its 5% profit goal just a couple of days later **(2)**. That was enough for us to take profits on half the position. As usual we [raised the stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry price. That happened to coincide with the high of the reversal day. Three days later it hit the 10% profit goal **(3)**. We took profits on the remaining position. It went higher for a few more days but then saw a 14% pullback.


The pullback provided another opportunity. After touching the [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), Match Group stock showed another reversal day **(4)**. It closed in positive territory, at the top of its range, with an increase in volume **(4)**. This time, it didn't surpass the high of the previous day. It hovered just below the 5-day moving average line and gave a final shakeout with another touch to the 50-day line **(5)**. Even at its lows that day, Match Group stock didn't breach the low of the reversal day.


The patience paid off as the 5% profit goal occurred four days after the reversal day **(6)**. Match Group stock met its 10% profit goal on the 10th day as it broke into new high ground **(7)**. It demonstrates the power of reversal days. Rather than buying at the breakout of the short consolidation, you already have a 10% profit cushion. That can be the start of a beautiful relationship.

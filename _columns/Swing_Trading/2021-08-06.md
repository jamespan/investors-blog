Should you hold a stock through earnings? As with many portfolio management questions, the answer is "it depends." For [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), the short-term holding period makes the answer easier. It's a no. PINS stock is a good example of why.




Pinterest Stock Offers Destination For Inspiration
--------------------------------------------------


**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) was one of the big winners after the coronavirus crash. With people staying home, they looked for inspiration on how to accommodate different uses of space. PINS stock soared as it provided a destination for that inspiration.


While many of the coronavirus winners suffered in 2021, Pinterest stock looked interesting after finding support at its 200-day moving average line **(1)**. Especially attractive was the upside reversal on an [outside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-an-outside-day-in-stock-charts/), a classic swing trading pattern. One issue that stopped us from adding it on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) was that PINS stock still traded below its 50-day moving average. Volume also seemed heavier on the downside prior to the reversal and lighter on the upside.


But we kept PINS stock on our radar, especially as it rose 25% over the next month **(2)**.

Another Chance For PINS Stock
-----------------------------


Pinterest stock nearly dropped back to the reversal entry over the next few weeks. But when it flashed another upside reversal, it gave us another chance **(3)**. This time, it found support at both the 50- and 200-day lines on another outside day. This was also a notably strong reversal in the market on July 19. This was a similar setup in many stocks, like **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), [highlighted in last week's column.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/shopify-stock-presented-on-a-silver-platter-due-to-stock-market-reversal/)


When PINS stock gapped above our 5% profit goal, we took our first third profit **(4)**. Over the next three days, Pinterest held the bulk of the gains from the gap. But like our Shopify stock example, it also had earnings coming up. For that reason, we took another third profit because it was flattening out **(5)**.


As a swing trading rule, we don't hold a stock through earnings. The reason? Many companies can see losses of 10% or more after an earnings report. With enough cushion and a longer time horizon, you might be able to weather that storm in a position trade. But swing trading has a shorter time horizon, smaller profit targets, and smaller loss requirements. You simply can't afford the risk or the time to wait.


Final Exit Before Earnings Report
---------------------------------


We made our final exit on PINS stock prior to the earnings report coming out **(6)**. We sold it early in the trading session since it started off weak. Knowing it would exit that day, there wasn't much reason to let PINS stock get weaker.


Even though Shopify stock only suffered a minor loss on its earnings report, we followed our rules. The earnings reaction of PINS stock shows the necessity of the rule. [Pinterest gapped down nearly 20% after its earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pinterest-quarterly-results-topple-estimates-but-user-growth-misses/) **(7)**. Beating estimates on the top and bottom lines wasn't enough. Slower-than-expected user growth shook investors. Not only would the loss have wiped out our gains from PINS stock, the large loss could have wiped out many of the gains of the prior weeks. The example solidifies the reason for our rule on not holding through earnings.

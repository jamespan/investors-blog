Like most investing strategies, [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) can suffer from periods of underperformance. The last couple of months, in particular, have seen the S&P 500 index mask some of the rotation that's occurred underneath the surface in individual stocks.




Swing Trading Example: Regional Bank Stocks
-------------------------------------------


Take just one area: the regional banks. We'll use the SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF ([KRE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KRE)) as a good representation of the group.


With the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, [banking stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansachs/) had a strong run from November to March. As the regional bank stocks pulled back, KRE quickly found support around its 50-day moving average line **(1)**.


The rebound got stronger and we added the regional bank ETF to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as it cleared the 50-day line decisively **(2)**. From a swing trading perspective, we could exit at the lows of our entry and only lose about 3%. But should KRE return to its highs, we could see an 8% gain.


Taking Profits While We Have Them
---------------------------------


Once we hit 3% profit, we took a third of the position off to lock in some gains **(3)**. It's a useful swing trading strategy to take partial profits quickly with strength. May 4 saw a wild day and at the lows, we were nearly back to our entry **(4)**. But we try to wait until the end of the day to make decisions. In this case, the regional bank ETF found support at its 10- and 21-day moving average lines.

---


A couple weeks into the trade, on May 10, we had a 6% profit in early trading **(5)**. It didn't last and by the end of the day, KRE showed a downside reversal. That's a useful swing trading signal that short-term weakness could follow. While the next day was down **(6)**, it wasn't a decisive close below the 10-day line. We gave the ETF more room since we were already down to just 33% invested. The S&P 500 was finding support and closed in the upper part of its range and we held what we could to avoid falling further behind the benchmark index.


Since KRE couldn't seem to find support, we shed the remainder of the position as it looked to close below its 50-day line and nearly back to our entry **(7)**. We saw two weeks of gains disappear in just three days. But using the swing trading strategy of selling some into strength at least left us with a gain for the trade.


Another Try Fizzles Out
-----------------------


The regional bank stocks snapped back the next day and we added KRE back **(8)** as it cleared the resistance at highs from the prior three days. More than the ETF itself, it was the numerous swing trading setups in regional banks stocks that we found appealing.


Before we made enough progress to start locking in some profit, the swing trading idea fizzled. On May 18, the ETF gapped below the 21-day line where we had set our stop **(9)**. We try not to react too quickly in the morning and after the initial weakness the stock recovered ground the rest of the day.


The rally didn't last and we finally exited when it looked like we would see a decisive close below the 21-day line **(10)**. The regional bank stocks seem to have once again found support as did KRE at its 50-day line. Another swing trading setup? We passed this time as each rally finds itself at a lower high. It may require more strength to burst the regional bank stocks out of this range bound trading.

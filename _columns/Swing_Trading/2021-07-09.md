It's important in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) to avoid buying extended stocks. However, some of the strongest stocks are the ones moving the quickest. That's why we went with a half position on DDD stock even before we knew the why behind its move.


Swing Trading Example: DDD Stock
--------------------------------


One of those exciting technologies that's captured investors' imagination is 3D printing. But it's been a tumultuous year for stocks in that group, and decade for that matter. **3D Systems** ([DDD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDD)) is one of the leaders in the industry. DDD stock surged more than 500% earlier this year and then suffered a 70% correction.


But after support at its 200-day line **(1)** and a strong 90% bounce **(2)**, the stock seemed to settle into a more normal 20% corrective phase **(3)**. The calmer downtrend with volume falling is what put it on our watchlist.


When it broke above the downtrend line and passed 30, DDD stock started moving faster **(4)**. At the time we didn't know the reason, but because it had set up nicely, we wanted to participate in the strength. The stock was already up 10% for the day at the time of our alert to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) subscribers. We reduced the position size to a half to mitigate the increased risk.

As DDD stock continued higher, we learned it struck a co-development deal with **CollPlant Biotechnologies** ([CLGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLGN)). The deal would use 3D printing technology to provide a [matrix for supporting breast implants in reconstruction surgery](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/3d-systems-collplant-shares-rise-after-co-development-deal-271624374473). The promising technology certainly seemed lucrative. Still, after rising 10% from our entry, we took a third off to lock in some profits.


We also decided to let the remaining position run. With a sizable cushion in DDD stock, and some profits locked in, we could afford to give it some room.


Booking The Gains But Still Watching
------------------------------------


The next two days saw DDD stock hold its impressive gains **(5)**. It also set the lows of those two days as a reasonable line in the sand should the stock start weakening.


While the next day had a wider spread, DDD stock still managed to close midrange and with a 3% gain **(6)**. Though the next two days **(7)** were inside that action, there did seem to be resistance around 40.


We finally shed the position on July 2 as DDD stock not only undercut the lows of the last week but also closed below the 10-day line **(8)**.


However, that doesn't mean you forget a stock forever. After finding support at the 21-day moving average line **(9)**, DDD stock may still be worth watching to see if it can break a downtrend again. Watching what happens could be more important than the why.

In a couple weeks, earnings season will be ramping up along with the volatile moves that often accompany the earnings announcements. Having a strategy in place ahead of time is imperative to avoid potentially devastating losses.


Knowledge is power so you should know when the earnings report is due for a company before you make a trade. Sometimes it may be an estimate until the official date is set, but that is better than getting caught completely off guard. IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) provides either the estimate or the confirmed earnings date, including whether it will be before or after the close, for all active trades.


Since [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) relies on smaller gains taken quickly, big losses need to be avoided. An [option strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/earnings-season-may-bring-option-plays-if-market-cooperates/) can be used to essentially put a cap on the maximum loss or you can just plan on exiting trades before their announcements.


The latter strategy was used for **Dave & Busters** ([PLAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLAY)), a recent trade on SwingTrader that resulted in a quick profit just ahead of earnings. On March 9 the stock [reversed](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) from its 50-day moving average line on the heaviest volume in three months **(1)**. It was trading at 58.01 when it was added with an initial profit goal of 5% at 60.91.


On March 16, the 5% profit level was reached **(2)** and an alert went out to subscribers in the morning that profits were being booked at 61.14 rather than holding out for the larger 10% gain. A couple factors influenced the decision. First, an earnings announcement was expected on March 28, so the stock didn't have much time to progress to its 10% profit goal. Also, we had prior experience with Dave & Busters on SwingTrader. Back in July, the stock came within 10 cents of its 5% profit goal and then reversed. It was ultimately closed out with a 1% profit as the stop was raised to keep the trade profitable. The two factors swayed the balance in favor of taking profits quicker rather than risk their evaporation.


A realistic post-analysis suggests it was a prescient decision. A few days later, Dave & Busters fell more than 1%, along with the market on March 21. It ended up closing decisively below the 5-day moving average that day **(3)**. The following session, the stock fell all the way back to the 1% profit level intraday **(4)**. Either of those signals would have triggered sell decisions and resulted in lower profit.


Sure, a Monday morning quarterback could point to the heights reached just before earnings **(5)** and suggest that as a better sell. But in order hold for that length of time, you would have to turn your back on the earlier sell signals and expose yourself to extra risk. Even at its best, the stock still didn't hit the 10% profit goal. As the stock reacted to the earnings announcement, it fell as much as 5% intraday **(6)**. The safest place to view that kind of carnage is from the sidelines.

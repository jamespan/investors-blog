When the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were at all-time highs on Nov. 22, it was surprising how much weakness lay under the surface. After all, nearly half the stocks were already below their 50- and 200-day moving average lines. So what drove indexes higher? Some of the megacap stocks with their heavy weights in the indexes, like Apple stock, masked the broader weakness. Here is how Apple stock set up a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) recently.




Swing Trading Example: Apple Stock
----------------------------------


When the Nasdaq composite triggered its Oct. 14 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/), **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was still below its 50-day line **(1)**. That's not where we normally look for leadership, but Apple stock did have a very shallow base working for it at the time with just a 12% depth. After recovering half the loss of its base, Apple traded tightly and firmly above its 50-day.


The tight action setup showed a traditional entry at 153.27, 10 cents above the high of the handle **(2)** of its shallow cup base. On Nov. 17, we used a slightly earlier entry on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) with an area of resistance around 152, giving us a little cushion in our position on the day of the breakout **(3)**.


The low of the tight area was right around the 50-day line and provided a logical stop. The risk was low at just above 3%.


Apple stock followed up from the breakout with another strong day and we had over a 3.5% gain when we took our first third of profit **(4)**. The gains continued the next day and we took another third of profit **(5)**.


The Good And Bad Of Quick Profits
---------------------------------


There's the adage, "you can't go broke taking a profit." That doesn't tell the full story. There is certainly the opportunity cost of missing out on future profits. That can be hard to swallow when you see another gain of over 3% occur with a lighter position size. That's what happened on Nov. 22 in Apple stock. But notably by the close, the stock reversed and wiped out its gains for the day **(6)**. These [downside reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) can be an indication of weakness to come. Also, recall this was the peak day for the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 which not only lost their gains that day but turned to a substantial loss for the day.


Apple stock fell below its 5-day line a few days later after concerns of the omicron variant surfaced **(7)**. We were back at the level of our initial profit taking and facing potential headline headwinds over the weekend. It was an easy decision to lock in gains.


Arguably, a case could be made that Apple stock showed support at its 10-day line. On the bounce a few days later **(8)** it would be normal to have regret set in. But even though Apple stock piled on even more gains the next day, it had another weak close **(9)**. The odds favor short-term weakness in Apple stock and with the market indexes crumbling the prospects look even bleaker. Accepting that we won't take our gains at the very top can allow for better sleep when things show strength after your sell. And often, you will see a stock trade back at your exit, or lower, very soon afterward.

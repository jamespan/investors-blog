This week saw a violent rotational shift in leadership. An early [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) entry for ALB stock allowed us to take profits into strength and exit with a gain for the trade.




Early Swing Trading Entry For ALB Stock
---------------------------------------


With the Nasdaq composite basing since mid-February, cyclical stocks have garnered more attention than growth. Sectors like energy, financials, materials became favored over growth. But there's been rotation under the surface of the indexes. **Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) is an example of how we finished a trade positive by following simple rules before the latest rotation hit hard.


The 50-day moving average line contained the move in ALB stock while its industry group, specialty chemicals, shot up 20 spots from the 90s to the 70s. ALB stock joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on May 27 around 165 with trading volume coming in at its heaviest in more than two weeks **(1)**. While down the next day **(2)**, it remained within the upper half or our entry day's trading range and above our entry.


Following the holiday weekend for Memorial Day, ALB stock moved higher **(3)** and cleared resistance around 170. While this could be viewed as a legitimate entry, our early entry put us in a position where we already had about a [5% gain](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/). We took some profits into the strength.

Another benefit of the early swing trading entry is when ALB stock pulled back below the 5-day moving average **(4)**. At its worst for the day, it never touched its 10-day line and ended up closing in the upper part of its trading range. Our early entry also made it so we were never below our entry. It might have gone a different way with an entry around 170. We had the flexibility to give it more room.


Escaping The Rotation
---------------------


A few days later and ALB stock moved higher giving us a 7.5% profit at its peak **(5)**. The close was strong and nothing looked amiss. Even the next day **(6)** was reminiscent of the day following our entry. The trading range was small, the action remained not only an inside day but inside the upper half of the trading range. Nothing concerning.


The next day, however, was a different story. ALB stock had a decisive close below both its 5- and 10-day moving average lines **(7)**. While it could possibly find support at the 21-day line, we didn't want to wait for our profits to disappear completely â€” especially after the strong gain we had. It exited that day and only got worse from there **(8)**.


To be clear, the rotation didn't leave SwingTrader unscathed. A number of strong-looking setups had quick and violent reversals that led to underperformance vs. the indexes. However, booking profit in ALB stock left us with less exposure and kept the trade positive. The early swing trading entry, combined with selling into strength and quick action on the exit were key components of that success.

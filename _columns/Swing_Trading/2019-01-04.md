It is still too early to tell whether the stock market correction is over. That's why we use caution for any [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) put on right now. Test trades with a half position are useful in that regard. They help you get a read on the current market action with little risk to your portfolio, due to smaller position sizes. **Medpace Holdings** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) provides an example.




Swing Trade Strategy Example: Medpace Stock
-------------------------------------------


As background, Medpace fell nearly 30% from its 52-week high to its October low **(1)**. Its more recent low in December **(2)** held above that prior low while the major market indexes continued to undercut their lows and turn negative for the year. It led to a strong relative strength line compared to most growth stocks **(3)**. That relative strength continued to build as the indexes fell on Dec. 24 while Medpace stock turned in a robust 4.3% gain **(4)**. It also got support at its 200-day moving average line. While the day was strong, we needed more proof that it could break its downtrend.


On Dec. 26, indexes jumped sharply and Medpace was among the leaders of the day **(5)**. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) but as a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/). Two factors informed the [position size](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-calculator-swing-trading-tool/) decision. While the market showed a strong start to a rally attempt, we still lacked a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) to confirm a trend change. Without that confirmation, it is usually premature to start increasing exposure aggressively. Second, the strong move for the day created a [larger risk percentage](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-swing-trade/) than normal. Using an undercut of the entry day low as our [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-china-trade-war-baozun-stock/) was well beyond our normal 3% risk percentage maximum. The half position would help mitigate the extra risk.


The stop loss remained intact the next day as Medpace retraced most of the price discovery from our entry day **(6)**. On Dec. 31, Medpace seemed to break out of its trading range but found resistance at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) **(5)**. While it still closed in the upper part of its trading range, it was well off its morning highs. It should be noted the huge swell in [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-speaks-volumes-for-trades/) is a little misleading **(7)**. Most of that came at the end of the trading day in anticipation of Medpace joining the S&P Midcap 600 on Jan. 2.


Half Position Triggers Sell Signals
-----------------------------------


The following day we were at a crossroads. Near the end of the trading day the stock looked like it would make a [decisive close below its 5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) **(8)**. After a week's time, we were still underwater on the trade, suggesting Medpace might need more time. We removed the stock with a tiny 0.67% loss, thanks to the half position. Medpace rallied into the close but our alert was already out.


It proved to be the right call. Though the stock traded above our exit price early the next trading day, it eventually undercut the stop loss and continued lower **(9)**. We'll keep Medpace stock on our radar. It just wasn't ready at the time of that swing trade.

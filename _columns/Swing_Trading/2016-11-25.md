Traders are always on the lookout for that secret magical indicator that will help time buys and sells for the most profit. The "golden cross" is by no means a secret, nor the panacea of technical indicators, but it can still be useful.


The golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. It's used as a bullish technical indicator by many traders, with the 50-day moving average often being used as the short-term line and the 200-day moving average acting as the longer-term line. This indicator isn't mentioned frequently in Investor's Business Daily because it tends to be late compared to most of our buying rules. However, the golden cross still acts as a positive confirmation of a strong uptrend and can provide extra conviction that you may be looking at a sustained rally.


As is often the case, a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) style will focus on moving averages with fewer periods. You could use the 5-, 10- and 50-day moving averages in a few combinations for the golden cross. Using moving averages with fewer periods will generally get you signals earlier, but the trade-off is having more of those signals runs the risk of losing performance due to false signals and quick shakeouts.


The most recent market signal for the shorter-term golden cross was on Nov. 10, when the Nasdaq's 5-day moving average crossed above the 10-day moving average **(1),**just one day after [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) switched the Market Action back to "uptrend," postelection. The next week, the 5-day moving average crossed above the 50-day moving average on Nov. 15 **(2)**and then, finally, the 10-day moving average crossed above the 50-day line on Nov. 18 **(3)**. The shorter-term moving averages being above the longer-term moving averages suggested that the uptrend is solidly intact.


Taking a look at earlier this year, 2016 started out with a downtrend, and the 50-day crossed above the 200-day moving average for the first time on the Nasdaq composite May 19. This is an example of its tardiness. The IBD market outlook had already called a [follow-through day](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=735761&sourceid=735764) and switched to "market in confirmed uptrend" on Feb. 17, three months and 4% sooner.


In fact, by the time that longer-term golden cross occurred, the outlook had been downgraded to "uptrend under pressure" and the Market Action for SwingTrader was at a Sideways Trend. The market had been pulling back for three weeks. To be fair, since then that golden cross has been intact as the only signal for the year, and the index is up 15% from there.


Using shorter-period moving averages, the 5-day line crossed above the 10-day line on Feb. 18, just a day later than the shift in IBD's market outlook. The early indicators give greater opportunities for catching the initial strong moves that start a rally. On the downside, rather than one signal for the year, there have been 12.

Decisions in [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) always rely on ever-changing, and at times incomplete, information. Just as a poker player can second-guess a decision when the dealer reveals all the cards, a trader can bemoan actions that take place after decisions are final. In both cases, having rules to play the hand you are dealt gives you the confidence to keep playing — knowing that you might not win every hand, but you can still walk away with more money in the bank.


Lately, traders have had to contend with a number of issues: short-term market weakness immediately followed by new highs, sector rotation that makes what was hot one minute, a loser the next, and then there is the normal pitfalls of an earnings season. Nevertheless, if you still keep your win-rate positive and your winners bigger than your losers, you will come out ahead.


Take **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), a stock that should be no stranger to IBD readers. It has been on multiple stock screens since February 2016 including the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [Big Cap 20](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). It was also one of the [first trades](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on March 11, 2016 during the real-time beta testing and [appeared again](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/let-the-stock-market-shape-your-swing-trading-strategy/) on Dec. 14 during a 10-day streak of gains.


Most recently, Nvidia made it to SwingTrader on Oct. 9 **(1)** as it followed through on an earlier [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-stock-breakout-strategies-have-familiar-rules/). Our entry price was 185.73. We immediately saw five days of gains and took half profits after the stock came within 2 cents of its 5% profit goal **(2)**. As usual, we also raised the stop to the 1% profit level to protect our profit if the stock quickly reversed.


On Oct. 16, the next trading day **(3)**, Nvidia rose some more and hit its 5% profit goal. Over the next couple of weeks, it came right up to 200 and then reversed lower. That resistance caused concern, as did a few intraday drops that mimicked the market. Oct. 19 saw a 2.6% drop before Nvidia got support at its 10-day moving average line **(4)**. While it did breach its 5-day moving average a few times, there weren't any decisive closes below it.


That is until Oct. 25 when the stock breached both its 5- and 10-day moving averages and we removed the remaining position **(5)**. At this point, Nvidia was on its thirteenth day on the list, fell more than 3% off its high and the Nasdaq composite was flattening. In fact, on that day a 2% drop in Nvidia occurred in just 10 minutes in early trading as the Nasdaq sold off hard. Had we waited to the close, we would have gotten out at a similar price, but the drop that early in the day certainly could have gotten worse. Overall, our two exit areas averaged to a 4.1% gain, our third profitable trade in Nvidia.


By Friday's close, after we were out, Nvidia finally cracked 200. The extra gains would have been nice, but we still walked away ahead on the trade. Looking back it would be tough to justify holding the stock while it broke short-term support. We didn't get to see all the cards until the trade was done.

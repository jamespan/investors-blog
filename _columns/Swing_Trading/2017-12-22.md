A [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategy relies on capturing short-term trends for maximum benefit. If the stock stops trending, the general rule of thumb is to go elsewhere with your money. Either in a stock with better opportunities or in cash to lessen the risk when there is less chance for reward.


Take enterprise software developer, **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)). A recent rebound from its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) started on Dec. 6 **(1)**. The Nasdaq composite, on the same day, looked like it was reversing after a mild 2.6% pullback. RingCentral looked particularly attractive because of the market action and even though volume was above average on the pullback, the drop was mild compared to most other tech names.


RingCentral joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 46.50 on Dec. 7 as it followed through on its rebound **(2)**. Volume was tracking much heavier than usual at the time of its entry, a good sign. By the day's close, at 48.20, the stock had vaulted more than 6% on the largest volume in four weeks **(2)** and well above the trading volume during the pullback. The position already had a solid cushion of nearly 3.7%.


The gains in RingCentral improved the next day and we took half profits at 48.85 when it reached its [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-profits-knowing-when-to-say-when/) **(3)**. Our general rule is to raise the stop at the same time to a 1% profit level. If a stock starts pulling back that much after a solid gain, it often needs more time to work.


The rule triggered the next trading session **(4).** We exited the remaining position and our average exit price saw a 3% gain in just three days. Our expectations were higher since the stock moved so quickly out of the gate, but we didn't let emotions cloud our implementation of the rule.


Was it a good decision to exit at that point? If we didn't sell there, we most likely would have sold at an even lower price the next day when RingCentral closed more than 1% below its [5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-averages-can-help-lock-in-stock-profits/). Nevertheless, it certainly didn't look so smart when the stock started to rally again. It gained as much as 7.2% from the original entry at its peak **(5)**.


However, those gains quickly evaporated and now two weeks after the exit the stock is less than a point higher. What else happened during those two weeks? SwingTrader put on five new names: three have taken half profits at 5%, one exited with an average gain of 2.4% and the other is up over a percent. In other words, holding a stock that doesn't progress can often have an overlooked cost: the cost of missed opportunities in better prospects.

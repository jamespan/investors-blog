Foreshadowing isn't just for English class. When Snap stock dropped 8% in one day, you might have looked at the warning sign that preceded it. Heeding the warning allowed us to keep the trade positive on SwingTrader.




Swing Trading Example: Snap Stock
---------------------------------


**Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) had a strong 2020 and offered multiple swing trades. Most recently, it had an attempt at breaking a downtrend at the end of the year **(1)**. That one couldn't hold even until the end of the day. But another chance came along Jan. 7 with a much better close **(2)**.


Snap stock joined [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snap-stock-buy-now/) that day. We had already noted strength in the overall group with a spot for group mate **Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) on our current trades list earlier in the week.

Snap stock quickly hit our 5% profit goal a couple of days later and we took a one-third profit **(3)**. The 5% profit goal has some flexibility to it. With less volatile stocks we might lock in that first profit sooner. Because Snap stock tends to have wilder swings, we waited to take profit at a higher level.


Outside Days: A Positive And A Negative
---------------------------------------


The day we took that profit was notable for another reason. It was an outside day. That's where the low undercuts the low of the previous day and the high surpasses the high of the previous day. You end up with the price action engulfing the prior day's bar.


Why is this important? It sets up an expectation. Where a stock closes suggests directionality of the move to follow. In this case with Snap stock, the close in the upper part of the range suggested strength would follow. Which it did.


Contrast that with the trading in Snap stock two days later **(4)**. This was also an outside day. We wanted to lock in another one-third profit when we hit 9% from our entry but the price at that height was too fleeting. Snap stock quickly reversed and it closed near the lows of the day.


That sets up the opposite expectation. You expect weakness will follow. Which it did.


Keeping The Trade Positive
--------------------------


We often use a decisive close below a short-term moving average line as a place to exit stocks. But outside days with a wider than usual trading range are another warning sign we tend to heed. We exited the remaining position near the end of the trading day.


As a result, we left the trade positive. Our final exit was 2.3% above our entry and the earlier profit taking helped increase the overall profit for the trade. More importantly, we sidestepped the 8% drop the next day **(5)**. While Snap stock could easily bounce back, that's not the type of drop we want to sit through for swing trading. We might not know how the book ends on Snap stock, but the outside day foreshadowed what could happen on the next page.

If you're familiar with the IBD style of investing, you know that we do things different. Instead of "buy low, sell high" we prefer "buy high, sell higher." But reversals in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), like in PODD stock, might be a little of both. Play the reversal right and the lower entry gives you a cushion in the stock by the time it reaches a breakout.




Swing Trading Example: PODD Stock
---------------------------------


A [revolution in treatments for diabetes](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/medical-device-companies-ignite-revolution-diabetes-treatment/) made **Insulet** ([PODD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PODD)) an attractive story. After promising numbers from its last [earnings report in November](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/insulet-stock-rockets-diabetes-treatment-player-crushes-quarterly-forecasts/), PODD stock went on a run. During the normal pullback in price the next month, there was opportunity.


It got support at its 50-day moving average line as it stood 8% off its high. PODD stock rebounded strongly from the line **(1)** and joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as it cleared the high of two days prior. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) wasn't at new highs, but did show a dramatic shift from a downtrend **(2)**. Trading volume was below average but the highest in nearly two weeks.


If PODD stock went back to new highs from our entry, we'd have an 8% gain with the potential for more. Using the low of the entry day or either of the two days prior, would keep our loss small and manageable.


Early Entry Provides Cushion Ahead Of Breakout
----------------------------------------------


A few days later we hit our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/)**(3).** PODD stock was up sharply but pulled back by the close and we wanted to take some off the table. That way if the stock continues moving higher, we still participate. We also [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) for the remaining position. If it's a short-lived move that gets into trouble, the 1% profit level is an easy line in the sand to help keep a good gain in your trades. There's no reason to let a good profit get away from you in swing trading.


By the time the stock broke out to new highs we were up nearly 10% from our initial entry and it wasn't until a couple of days later that we even had our first breach of the [5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) **(4)**. But note that we didn't sell at the breach. We waited to see how it closed, and by the end of the day, PODD stock looked strong.


A Sell Too Soon?
----------------


We hit our 10% profit goal the next day **(5)**and sent an alert to subscribers that we would give PODD stock room to run further. Since it got support at its 5-day moving average line before, we could use that like a trailing stop to prevent letting profits decline too far. The keeps a stock in your portfolio as long as its acting right.


We eventually exited the position in Insulet stock **(6)** with a few reasons behind the decision. First, a change of character as the stock staged a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/). The stock was up 1.3% for the day at its peak but ended down 1.5%. It also seemed to hit resistance at 200. We also had a stock market at risk. The major averages were extended, but also faced coronavirus fears.


A week later and PODD stock is up from our exit but not by much. It seems like 200 is still acting as a barrier. You also have its next earnings report due on Feb. 25 after the close. A key tenet of swing trading is that you don't have to get out at the top to make good money on a trade.

As 2021 comes to a close, you may be looking for the magic indicator to help guide your [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) for 2022. Consider relative strength. It often gives early clues for stock market winners and even shorter trades. Dell stock is just one example.




Swing Trading Example: Dell Stock
---------------------------------


**Dell Technologies** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) might not make the list of most talked about stocks of 2021. It's easy to underestimate. But as the year closes out, it might surprise you to learn that Dell stock matched **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) in its annual gain. With more than a 50% rise, Dell stock nearly doubled the performance of the S&P 500. Much of its move was in the first months of the year, but there were smaller moves elsewhere. And it could set up again.


Before its last earnings report, Dell stock found support at its 50-day line **(1)** as it formed a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/). Dell moved strongly the next day on its earnings report and joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on the bounce from its 50-day line **(2)**. It was also breaking a short downtrend line and, along with the strong earnings report, the technical action earned Dell the honor of being [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dell-stock-rises-on-third-quarter-earnings-beat/).


But the omicron variant quickly put a damper on the stock market starting the day after Thanksgiving. Dell stock fell nearly 2% that day **(3)**, but that was still less than either the Nasdaq composite or S&P 500.


Relative Strength Among Weakness
--------------------------------


In fact, what kept Dell stock on SwingTrader was the fact that it resisted the down move. That's not to say it didn't go down. The close below the 10-day line **(4)** is normally an area that would lead to an exit. But considering that the market indexes were falling below their 50-day moving averages, Dell stock stood out. It was still holding above the lows of its entry day, whereas the indexes were well below their comparable areas of support.


As the indexes showed signs of a possible bottom, Dell stock was unscathed **(5)**. In fact, it showed a breakout from its flat base the next day with itsÂ [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) reaching new highs **(6)**. We took the opportunity to take our first third profit.


But the relative strength didn't hold. A few days later we exited the position on a close below its five-day line **(7)**. Why the stricter sell this time? Relative strength again. The indexes were rising while Dell stock struggled. We wanted to protect the profit that we had.


The action saved us from an 8% drawdown over the next two weeks **(8)**. But don't let Dell stock fall off your radar. This winner of 2021 rebounded with the market on Dec. 21 **(9)** and could have more opportunities for swing trades.

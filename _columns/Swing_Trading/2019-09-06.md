One of the benefits of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) is that winning stocks will often provide multiple opportunities for profit. That was certainly the case with a recent move in Coupa stock ahead of earnings.




The enterprise software group stood out for its monster performance in 2019. Up 55% at its peak in July, the industry group is the home of many stock market leaders this year with even greater performance. **Coupa Software** ([COUP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COUP)) falls into that camp as it's already doubled for the year. But if you missed it at its start in January, does that mean you had to forgo profits in Coupa stock? Not at all.


Swing Trading Example: Coupa Stock
----------------------------------


Coupa stock was trading around 148 in July **(1)** before the market started a mild correction. But while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 both got stuck below their 50-day moving average lines, Coupa stock got [support at its 50-day line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/kirkland-lake-gold-stock-jumps-trade-war-swing-trading/). It led to the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) holding up nicely. We added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on Aug. 16 as the stock recovered strongly above its 50-day line **(2)**. The day before was still inside the drop to the 50-day line, so not conclusive for an entry. Waiting the extra day meant paying a higher price but gave a higher probability for success.


A quick note on the [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) at the time of the entry. Coupa stock was well below the average volume over the prior 50 days, but that was fairly typical of most of the market in the summer months. We did have the benefit that the volume at the entry was tracking higher than the prior 10 days. Given the shorter time frame used in swing trading, that makes the [shorter moving averages more relevant](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/).


Protecting Gains During Stock Market Turmoil
--------------------------------------------


A few days later, Coupa stock neared our 5% profit goal shortly after the open **(3)**and we took half profits as the stock started pulling back. We knew we had some headline risk that day with Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaking. China added some tariffs as a retaliation in the trade war, and the market seemed to take that in stride as well. Still, we took profits early when we were a little shy of our 5% profit goal. In addition, we [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry.


The next hour, Coupa stock hit the 5% profit goal, but shortly after that [intense selling hit the stock market](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-falls-after-trump-tweets/) with tweets from President Donald Trump. The Nasdaq composite ended the day with a 3% loss on heavy volume and leading stocks took their beatings. We exited the remaining shares in Coupa stock as it hit our raised stop.


Could Have Been Better, Could Have Been Worse
---------------------------------------------


At then end of the day, the action in Coupa stock wasn't terrible comparatively. With a loss of under 1%, it fared much better than the Nasdaq composite. It also recovered better with an attempt at new high ground that got turned away two days later **(4)**. It's notable that this was around the old highs where the stock met resistance **(1)**. Sure, an exit there offered a higher price. But the risk posed by the headlines and the stock market action at the time makes it an easier assessment in hindsight. If anything, the early entry off the 50-day line at least gave you a chance to make the trade profitable.


Over the next week, Coupa stock fell back below its 50-day moving average and closed well below our entry **(5)**. Holding on longer risked turning a winning trade into a losing one. Additionally, with earnings on the near horizon, holding was even riskier. Earnings propelled Coupa stock to new high ground **(6)**, but for swing trading the quick profits in a short time was the preferred play.

Capturing a powerful move in a short time is one of the main goals of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). These strategies also can be useful in avoiding risky sideways action in stocks, or worse, negative reversals that can shake you out. Novocure stock is a profitable case in point.




Swing Trading Example: Novocure Stock
-------------------------------------


**Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) provides products for the treatment of brain cancer. The stock price action got our attention as it started moving counter to the market. While the Nasdaq composite corrected more than 10%, Novocure stock was near new highs, forming the right side of a cup **(1).** It added a short handle over the next week. When it crossed the high of the handle at 54.98, [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) was unimpressive **(2)**. In addition, the Nasdaq composite hadn't shown a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) yet as it started recovering from its correction. It's hard to muster excitement for a stock in those conditions.


More than a week later, volume did power a strong move for Novocure stock **(3)**. Over the next week volume continued to skyrocket as the stock price jumped 10% — but then came back down almost as quickly **(4)**. The pullback was the first time in nearly two months that the stock closed below its 10-day moving average for more than one day. A bounce from the pullback could be a chance at quick profits. The stock already demonstrated its ability to make a 10% move in very little time.


Reversal Leads To Nice Profit
-----------------------------


On June 27, Novocure stock showed a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) **(5)**. Intraday, it took a pause and we added the stock to [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as it started moving to new highs for the day. It was already up 3.6% for the day and surpassed an area of resistance around 58. While the Nasdaq composite was still trying to recover from a 1.5% drop on June 25, Novocure stock cleared the highs of its last few days. It also put the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) up strongly **(5)**. We set our [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/when-to-sell-stocks-docusign-stock/) at the entry day low, giving us around a 3% risk.


Over the next couple hours the stock jumped and approached our 5% profit goal. We suffered a string of losses during the stock market correction and there was still a looming meeting with China regarding tariffs set to occur in two days time. We decided to take profits a little early at 4.5%. But only on half the position. With that kind of strength in a day, we wanted to see if it could extend the gains. We also raised our stop to 1% profit from our entry.


Sell Or Hold Novocure Stock?
----------------------------


Over the weekend, a cease-fire agreement in the China trade war looked like it would unleash some pent-up demand. Shortly after the opening bell, we were already at our 10% profit goal **(6)**. We considered holding out for a bigger gain. After waiting a few minutes to see if Novocure stock would move up strongly after its open, things started turning. Novocure stock traded below its open and was pulling back. The Nasdaq composite was trading below its open and we already saw how readily Novocure stock could give away profits. Instead of holding, we decided not to be greedy.


The price recovered temporarily as we sent our profit-goal alert to subscribers but a few minutes later the stock was undercutting the lows of the trading session again. As the market gains faded, Novocure kept getting hit by selling and went negative for the day. Taking the profits when we had them saved us from a nasty bearish reversal. Even though the stock didn't undercut our raised stop, it would have been a difficult hold as a swing trade.


Over the next few days, Novocure stock righted itself and is trading right around our final exit and nearing a 20% gain from its low volume breakout. It might still have some gains to go, but stocks often pause at that 20% gain level. Taking our profits when we have them avoids a lot of risky time sitting in sideways-moving stocks.

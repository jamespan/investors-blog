The short-term nature of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) requires a different set of rules and strategies in order to manage positions. A recent trade in Twitter stock demonstrates.




Stock Market Weakness Can Lead To Early Sells
---------------------------------------------


The last earnings report led to an 8.9% gain in **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) **(1)**. Triple-digit earnings growth the last two quarters was enough to get investors' attention. As it pulled back slightly we saw a swing trading opportunity. When buying pushed Twitter stock to new highs we put it on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(2)**. We set a stop at the low of the entry day near 41.


Unfortunately, the market did not cooperate. Between tariffs, recession fears and Fed policy, the stock market took hits from multiple fronts. We removed Twitter stock before it hit its stop-loss, citing a weak market and a desire to keep losses small. Not only did the decision avoid a certain stop trigger **(3)**, it also avoided flat activity over the next two weeks during continued stock market weakness. No reason to risk capital when things are moving sideways.


But it also pays not to let things drop off your radar. Twitter stock held up well during the stock market weakness, giving little ground while the relative strength line held strong. That left it high on our watchlist if the stock market turned around.


Another Try For Twitter Stock
-----------------------------


As the stock market flashed potential signs of recovery, Twitter showed a strong rebound as well. It joined Swing Trader again, starting with a half position early in the trading session **(4)**. We followed up with the other half as it continued higher during the day. The gains continued to pile on the next two days. Then stock market weakness returned.


The Nasdaq composite kept getting turned away at its 50-day moving average line. Many leading stocks had trouble with their forward progress as well. Twitter stock nearly hit the [5% level](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/take-profits-early-regenexbio-stock/) where we often take half profits **(5)**. But with the market still vulnerable, it ultimately gave back that 5% gain and more. Rather than letting the trade go negative, we took it off early again due to market weakness **(6)**. Instead of a small loss we took a small gain.


However, our [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) product kept its position. As a position trade, Twitter stock is finding support at its 41.02 entry whereas many other stocks are breaking down.

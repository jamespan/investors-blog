[Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) isn't just for individual stocks. A sector ETF can provide a way to profit on a trend without the individual stock risk. A biotech ETF or semiconductor ETF, for instance, gives you access to sectors capable of big moves without having to rely on the fortunes or risks of one company. While the extra diversification does offer some protection, it also tends to water down results. But leveraged ETFs can put you near the performance you would expect from a leading stock. And you still get the diversification.




Semiconductor ETF Shows A Familiar Setup
----------------------------------------


You might notice that sector ETFs often provide patterns similar to what you normally find while swing trading. It makes recognizing setups that much easier. After a short stock market pullback in March, a number of chip stocks looked poised to continue their runs. On March 8, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) showed a [reversal pattern](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) **(1)**. These patterns tend to show a wider spread from the high to the low with a close near the top of its trading range for the day. The semiconductor ETF also got support at its 200-day moving average line. Even though it closed with a loss, the show of support provided a profitable setup.


The next day, the semiconductor ETF surpassed the high of the reversal day and we put it on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(2)**. We considered a leveraged ETF like the Direxion Semiconductor Bull 3x ([SOXL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOXL)). Given that the pullback in the market was so short, we opted for the unleveraged semiconductor ETF instead. We didn't want to be overly aggressive with the stock market still fairly extended.


Selling Into Strength With Swing Trading
----------------------------------------


After our entry, the Nasdaq composite saw eight out of nine days with gains. That ninth day also saw the VanEck Semiconductor ETF hit our 5% profit goal **(3)**. Rather than following our normal routine of taking half profits, we took full profits. Why? First, we saw signals of an extended stock market. Second, we had over a 70% [win rate](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/) for the last three weeks and wanted to keep our gains by [selling into strength](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-stock-profits-on-the-way-up-to-compound-gains/). A 5% gain in nine days isn't bad for an ETF.


It ended up being a short-term top in the Nasdaq composite as well as the semiconductor ETF. Over the next week, stocks pulled back. Our SwingTrader [market outlook](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-the-market-action-is-saying-about-direction/) switched to sideways and [The Big Picture market outlook moved to "uptrend under pressure."](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/bears-hit-stock-indexes/) Holding the ETF would have seen our profits dwindle to just 1% **(4)**. Swing trading gave you a nice gain and avoided the pullback. Once the stock market regained its footing, you have the option of buying the position back and can often do so at a lower price than you sold.

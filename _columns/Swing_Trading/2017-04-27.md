With the market shift from sideways trend to uptrend, swing traders must decide how aggressive to be with their exposure and position sizes.


Stronger markets allow for larger positions — and potential profits. But you still need measures to mitigate risk. [Position size](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-can-help-balance-risk-and-reward/) in relation to your stop-loss percentage allows you to balance your risk and reward properly.


Risk is typically managed for each trade with your [stop](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) price. This is your predefined exit strategy and is tied to a logical point based on the chart. Market conditions may cause you to change your stop — usually raising it to cut a loss earlier or to maintain a minimum profit level. But you need to maintain a line in the sand where you won't let a loss become overwhelming. That line in the sand should also relate to how much you are willing to let any one trade affect your portfolio.


Say you've been relatively conservative, risking only 0.25% of your portfolio on any one trade based on your stop price. A market turning positive may encourage larger trades, bringing the risk to your portfolio up to 0.5% or more. Assuming your stop is 3% or less from your purchase price on a trade, your position size can change from 8% of your portfolio to 16% or more. Risk is still being managed with your stop price but gets changed with your position size to reflect the increased odds of success and the greater rewards offered.


What if your stop suggests an increased risk percentage? [Breakouts](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-stock-breakout-strategies-have-familiar-rules/) and [reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) often use the low of the entry or some logical area of support for the stop price. But a surging stock can lead to an increased risk percentage beyond the normal bounds of 3%. Passing on a stock with that kind of power deprives you of opportunities with significant potential. Playing the stock with a tighter stop increases the risk of getting shaken out and having the stock go up without you. Changing position size offers a solution. It can keep your portfolio risk the same without changing the logical spot of your stop to an arbitrary level.


That's what happened when **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)) was put on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on Feb. 8. The stock broke out strongly **(1)** on overwhelming volume but moved up so fast that the risk percentage for the trade was topping 5%. Rather than pass on the trade, a half-position was initiated. Since the stop wasn't moved up to reduce risk, the position was able to weather a quick shakeout **(2)** on Feb. 10 and reached a 5% profit goal **(3)** just a few days later. The stop was raised to protect profit at that point.


Prior resistance around 27 (not shown on this chart) was a concern and so the trade was removed on Feb. 15 at 26.21, just shy of its 10% profit goal **(4)**. The stock did move up from there **(5)**, topping at 27.83 on Feb. 21, before it pulled back below its five-day line. Earnings were just around the corner **(6)** which also encouraged an early exit.


In the past trades section of SwingTrader, profit is shown at 4% rather than 8% to reflect the half position. The smaller profit is certainly better than skipping the trade out of fear of the larger risk.

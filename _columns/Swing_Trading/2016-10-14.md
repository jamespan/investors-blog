Buying late is often a costly mistake. Purchasing an extended stock increases the likelihood that you could get shaken out in a normal pullback, take a bigger loss than necessary, or reduce your profit potential.


That being said, sometimes waiting and buying a little extended is preferable to avoid short-lived spikes in demand. IBD's newest product, [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), helps guide investors through this decision.


Take **Vasco Data Security** ([VDSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VDSI)), a setup from June 2015. It was a leading stock holding the No. 11 spot in the IBD 50 and its industry group was also strong. Security software was the No. 8 group of IBD's 197 Industry Groups and included other highly rated stocks such as **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)) and **Cyberark Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)).


Vasco offered an entry **(1)** at 27.86 on June 3 as it broke out from a 15-week [cup with handle](http://education.investors.com/education/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787). The stock crossed the [buy point](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787) in the first 10 minutes from the open and made its intraday high of 29.19 within the first hour. This is where it gets tricky. Buying early subjects you to a potential reversal later in the day but wait too long and you possibly buy extended or, if the stock moves too quickly, not at all.


Observing demand after a stock crosses a buy point is key to a successful purchase. Waiting an hour or so after a stock crosses the buy point could tell you whether demand is showing stamina. In the case of Vasco, the stock didn't get back to its intraday high for the rest of the trading day. If it had, in accompanying volume, that would suffice as evidence of demand. Otherwise, waiting to see the strength of the close is useful. Vasco closed well in higher volume **(2)** so a purchase at the end of the day was a decision based on the evidence of demand, even though the stock was more than 2% above the ideal buy point.


The following day **(3)** the stock started strong and closed weak, although it remained above the stop-loss trigger just under the breakout low. Volume was even higher **(4)** than the breakout. A couple days later, the position was back in the black, eventually offering profit-taking opportunities at 5% profit **(5)** or 10% profit levels **(6)** from the extended entry. Using a decisive close below the 5-day moving average **(7)** as a sell signal would have yielded over a 16% gain.


Using a similar strategy earlier in Vasco, would have saved you some heartache. On April 28, Vasco broke out from a buy point of 26.85, gapping above that level on its earnings announcement **(8)**. It made its intraday high in the first 10 minutes of trading and didn't challenge that level for the rest of the day. By the close, the stock had great volume **(9)** but had fallen back below the buy point and was in the lower quartile of its trading range. That would have suggested a pass.


Waiting might get you in at a higher level, but that's a small price to pay for increasing the likelihood of success.

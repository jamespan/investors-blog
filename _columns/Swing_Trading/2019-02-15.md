We've always been different with our mantras on buying stocks. Rather than "buy low, sell high," IBD has long suggested "buy high, sell higher." But that doesn't mean we won't use an early entry when possible. Especially with [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/).




One way to achieve an early entry is with a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/). A stock going through a normal pullback can offer an entry once it shows strength that the pullback is over. You will usually see support at moving average lines with [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) picking up. It suggests that with the weaker holders out of the way, investors with conviction are willing to resume their buying. These aren't beaten down stocks we're looking at. We look for stocks showing temporary weakness in an overall uptrend.


Swing Trading Example: HubSpot Stock
------------------------------------


Take **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) when it joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). It joined after reversing back above its 5- and 10-day moving average lines **(1)**. The pullback, in this case, corresponded to a [short handle area of a base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) that started back in September. Trading volume swelled on the reversal and the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) popped to new high territory **(1)**. These acted as extra confirmations in favor of swing trading HubSpot stock with an early entry.


Rather than waiting for the high of the handle at 158.66 or the all-time high at 162.20, our entry was 157.11. The early entry can be useful later on. As HubSpot stock [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) into new-high territory, we were already at our 5% profit goal **(2)**. We took half profits that day and [raised the stop](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) to 1% profit from our entry. Our swing trading profit goals are lower, but we expect them quicker. When we get the quick move, we protect the profits while staying open to further profit potential.


Early Entry Provided Profit Cushion
-----------------------------------


After some tight action, HubSpot started dipping. On Feb. 7, it traded a few ticks below its raised stop but immediately recovered. We watched it closely the rest of the day. We ultimately removed it from SwingTrader when HubSpot looked ready to [close decisively below its 5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-averages-can-help-lock-in-stock-profits/) **(3)**. The earlier profit taking allowed for a better overall percentage return in the trade of 3.7%. But the early entry also deserves credit for the swing trading reward.


The next day opened poorly but the 10-day line provided a level of a support and HubSpot stock found itself back at new highs shortly after **(4)**. Should it have been repurchased? Not in this case. An earnings report was due and as a rule we avoid earnings reports when swing trading. HubSpot had a big jump on earnings, enough to hit the 10% profit goal from our original entry **(5)**. But it didn't hold it. By the close, it was down for the day. The weakness continued as HubSpot traded well below its 5-day moving average line after that **(6)**.

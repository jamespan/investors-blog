Locking down profits in swing trading is a delicate balance. Hold too long and you can see gains disappear. Sell too soon and you miss opportunities for bigger rewards.


Since swing trading involves a shorter time period, short-term moving averages such as the 5- and 10-day lines are a valuable tool to determine when the trend may be shifting. But deciding which one to use can be tricky and is often dependent on market conditions.


The 5-day moving average has been the tool of choice for booking profits on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). Decisive closes below the line have prompted exits to retain profits. A post-analysis of the last two years reveals that in the most cases it was a good call. The break of the 5-day line often preceded a break of the 10-day line or at least sideways action of sufficient length to make holding the trade unappealing. However, in a more powerful market environment, we expect to shift more to the 10-day line and could potentially see stronger gains as a result.


**Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) provides a recent example where a shift to the 10-day might have helped but wouldn't have been easy to implement. The stock set up after an earnings gap that topped 40% **(1)**. Skechers pulled back over the next two weeks correcting nearly 13%. The fact that it retained the bulk of its gains from the gap suggested there could be a buying opportunity at a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/).


Once the stock reversed and cleared resistance, it joined IBD's SwingTrader **(2)**. A week later and Skechers reached a 5% profit target from our entry **(3)**. As is our custom, [we took profits on half the position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-profits-early-is-a-key-tenet-of-swing-trades/) and raised the stop to 1% profit from our entry.


After the Thanksgiving holiday, the stock hit our 10% profit goal **(4)**. Normally, we would take the opportunity to sell the remaining shares and book the profit. The two sells would average out to nearly an 8% gain. Enough trades like that over such a short time frame can really compound to a significant year. Stretching a few of those gains further can really add some velocity to your portfolio growth as long as you don't give up too much if you're wrong. Skechers seemed to be a candidate for larger gains given the strength behind its move to new high ground. However, by the end of the day the stock reversed throwing some doubt on the decision.


The stock looked like it was topping out a few days later as it reversed and lost ground that day and the next **(5).** Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite was showing short-term weakness trading below its 10-day moving average and looked to be on its way to the 50-day line. That prompted our removal of the remaining shares with the exit up more than 9% from the original entry. There wasn't much sacrifice for the potential of further gains.


It's worth noting that at the time of the removal, the 10-day line was still containing the move and Skechers didn't see a decisive close below the line until Dec. 29 **(6)**. An extra month of holding could have doubled the profit as the close of the day was more than 18% from the original entry. It's also encouraged us to search out similar opportunities to stretch gains if a more cooperative market environment presents itself.

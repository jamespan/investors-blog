This [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) column focuses a lot on selling into strength. While we used that strategy for HubSpot stock recently, there was a point where we could have been more aggressive with our selling. How much of a difference can early selling make?


HubSpot Stock A Daring Buy
--------------------------


**HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)), like many stocks in the enterprise software group, showed strong performance even before the Oct. 14 follow-through day. Just a couple of days prior **(1)**, it announced the addition of HubSpot Payments and earned a number of upgrades from analysts as a result. But it was quickly extended and we bided our time for an entry.


We considered an entry with a pullback to the 21-day moving average **(2)** but it didn't seem to be enough. Instead HubSpot stock joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as it found support at its 50-day moving average line a few weeks later **(3)**.


HubSpot was a daring buy for a few reasons. First, a number of stocks in the enterprise software group, **Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)) as just one example, had suffered heavy selling. The market itself seemed [propped up by just a few of the megacaps](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/gathering-strength-in-apple-stock-helped-mask-market-weakness/) as breadth continued to decline. The Russell 2000, which looked [promising during our UWM trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-russell-2000/), gave up all its gains and was back at its 50-day moving average line. The SwingTrader market action [was sideways the whole time since Nov. 10](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-qqq-into-strength-avoided-latest-fall/) as a result and our exposure overall light.


Surprising Strength, While It Lasted
------------------------------------


Our risk was rewarded, however. After the Thanksgiving holiday, fears over the omicron variant were rampant and the market indexes showed notable weakness. But HubSpot stock showed strength on the day **(4)**. We took advantage and sold our first third into the strength with over a 4% gain. It seemed especially wise since HUBS stock lost the bulk of its gains by the close.


The next day it snapped back to even bigger gains **(5)**. The market was also trying to make a stand that day with the Nasdaq composite finishing above the 21-day line. We had an 8% gain from our entry in HubSpot stock but were holding out for a 10% gain. Our exposure was already light and this was one of the few things working.


HUBS stock peaked the next day 9.5% above our entry, just shy of our 10% goal **(6)**. We had 800 as a line in the sand and by the close we were at 805.50, an outside day with a close at the lows. We removed HubSpot stock the next day at 796 to keep it above our entry **(7)**.


A rebound attempt at the 50-day line quickly failed and, at its most recent low **(8)**, HubSpot stock was 13.6% below our entry. So far its attempted rebound is hitting resistance at the 50-day line **(9)**. Though we gave away a lot of profits from the top, our early sell into strength and not letting it go negative left us with more than a 2% gain at our average exit price. Just taking another third off when we were up 8% and our final exit at the same point would have doubled our gain from the average exit price. Though there are the examples, like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), that go much higher, selling into strength often serves you well.

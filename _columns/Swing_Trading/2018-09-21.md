No matter how fast or strong a stock move is, you should have rules in place to take profits. It's easy to get caught up in how much money you can make if the stock keeps going. But for a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), you want to take profits when you have them, at least partially, to protect the profit you earned.




One of the hardest things about investing is that you often have to do things contrary to how you feel. It's why rules are so important. Rules based on data and precedent hold a lot more weight than feelings. When to sell stocks seems particularly fraught with emotion. Even when you are winning. Take profits too early and you miss out on even bigger profits. Take profits too late and you might not have much profits to take.


Regenxbio Stock Example: Why We Take Profits Early
--------------------------------------------------


**Regenxbio** ([RGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGNX)) had an exemplary move to start. On Sept. 14, the stock staged a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) from a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) **(1)**. It surpassed the high of the handle at 77.49 early in the trading day. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) was tracking more than double its average **(2)**. Regenxbio joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day and continued to rise.


Within a couple hours it made a quick move that launched the stock to 83.45, well above our first [5% price target](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/). The breakout looked sound. The immediate profit cushion bred confidence. Why take profits early when everything is going great? The simple answer: rules. We often take profits, at least partially, once we hit our first price target. In this case, we decided to take profits on half the position at 82.95 and see if we could get further gains on the remaining position **(3)**. Since it was the same day, the half-position reduction was technically a day trade. That can happen every now and then. But such moves are rare enough to avoid a broker labeling you as a pattern day trader. There's a big difference between [swing trading and day trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/day-trading-versus-swing-trading-comes-down-to-time/), and our goal is swing trading.

Despite our initial confidence, the further gains never materialized. However, we still didn't let all our gains evaporate. Once we hit our 5% price target, we automatically [raise our stop loss to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry for swing trades. This protects the profit on our remaining shares. If the stock starts going against us, we take profits on the remaining shares before we start losing capital.


For Regenxbio stock, it unfortunately happened near the stock market open the next trading day. Our original stop loss for Regenxbio stock was at 73.35, the low of the breakout day. Letting a 5% gain fall all the way down to the stop loss would mean taking a 12% drawdown from the high. We preferred to take profits on the remaining shares while we still had gains **(4)**. The raised stop loss rule offered a lot of protection in this case, as Regenxbio stock kept falling. By the end of the day, it was well below our original stop loss and 16% off its high. Through the end of the week, Regenxbio stock still hasn't recovered. Rather than bemoaning profits lost, we take profits while we have them.

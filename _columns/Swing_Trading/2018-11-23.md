The stock market downturn hasn't made it easy to make gains. But if you take profits quickly in your swing trades, it can help you eke out small gains while remaining nimble enough to avoid corrections. That's where [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) sell rules can help.




After a rough October, the market looked ready for a bounce leading into the midterm elections. **Ciena** ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) didn't correct nearly as much as most growth stocks. It carved out a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) with just an 11% correction. Just before Election Day, it [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) into new high ground on volume twice its average, and it joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day **(1)**.


Take Profits Quickly While You Still Have Them
----------------------------------------------


By the time the market saw a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) on Nov. 7, Ciena stock was already at a 5% gain **(2)**. This was also an opportunity to take profits quickly. A simple sell rule we often use is to take half profits once we have a 5% gain.


We look for a 10% profit goal on the remaining shares but we also want to protect the profits we have. So, another sell rule we employ is to raise our stop loss on the remaining shares. We will usually [raise our stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/) to 1% profit from our entry. If the stock starts to falter and we are in danger of going negative, we take profits quickly while we have them.

CLOSE




Another option is to use the [short-term moving averages](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) as a guide for when to take profits. First, Ciena stock fell below its 5-day moving average line on Nov. 9 but showed a positive reversal to close back above the line **(3)**. Our rule is to use a decisive close below the 5-day moving average line to take profits. So we held our stock on this day.


The following day, however, Ciena stock triggered our raised stop loss and we removed the rest of the position **(4)**. By the close, it was also well below its 5-day moving average line. The decision to take profits quickly gave us more than a 3% gain on the total swing trade for Ciena stock in just one week.


Even better, we avoided a nasty sell-off that followed. A couple of days later and Ciena stock was below its buy point. A [bullish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/reversal-days-swing-trading-buy-points/) on Nov. 15 looked promising **(5)** as the stock market rallied. But it didn't last.


The low of the reversal didn't hold **(6)** and Ciena stock just got worse from there and got as low as 8% below its buy point. It's especially important to take profits quickly when the stock market is stingy with prospects. Otherwise, you'll find that the stock market can take profits from you quicker than you earned them.

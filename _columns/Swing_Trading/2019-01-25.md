Keeping losses small is important for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). A short-term moving average can be an early indicator that a swing trade isn't going in the right direction.




Swing Trade Example: Incyte Stock
---------------------------------


**Incyte** ([INCY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INCY)) started a move on Jan. 3, up more than 7% despite the market indexes having sharp losses the same day **(1)**. The biotech stock announced a new CFO, got an upgrade from Guggenheim and participated in a broad move among biotech stocks after an announcement that **Bristol-Myers Squibb** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)) would purchase **Celgene** ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)). That put Incyte stock back above its 50- and 200-day moving average.


The strength didn't end there for Incyte. It jumped another 13% over the next three days and then consolidated the gains over four days. It looked poised for another move when it [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) into recent new high territory on Jan. 15 **(2)**. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) spiked above average and the relative strength line darted to new high ground as well **(2)**. We put it on SwingTrader that day and already had cushion on the position by the end of the day. We used the entry day low or a decisive close below the 5-day moving average as our [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/).


Short-term Moving Average Gives Early Sell Signal
-------------------------------------------------


The first problem Incyte stock exhibited was no follow-through move. It couldn't seem to surpass the high of the entry day **(2)**. An attempt on Jan. 18 nearly made it, but it ended with a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) and a loss for the day **(3)**. The next day the stock fell below its 5-day moving average line **(4)**. Part of the reason was the moving average line saw such a sharp incline while the stock went sideways. Our strategy is to observe the stock and see how it closes. For most of the day, Incyte went above and below our entry price but didn't show signs of recovery.


As the close of the market trading session approached, the biotech stock remained decisively below the 5-day moving average. Following our rules, we removed the stock from SwingTrader 30 minutes before the close **(4)**. There was a rally into the close but the stock still ended well below its 5-day moving average line.


The next day, things got worse. Incyte stock dropped below its 10-day moving average and the entry day low **(5)**. It's a recurring trend we've seen lately. A stock that breaks below the 5-day moving average will often close below its 10-day moving average shortly after. It's not fun to take a loss. In this case, our loss was just around a quarter percent. Waiting until a breach of the entry-day low would have made the loss closer to 3%. A small loss is much better than a large loss.

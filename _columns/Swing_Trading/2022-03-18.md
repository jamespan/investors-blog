  Is There Still More Gas In The Tank For Oil Stocks?

We had a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) in the S&P 500, which is an important first step to increasingÂ [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) activity. There is still the possibility it doesn't work. But assuming we get a tradable rally, where will the leadership come from?




Relative strength pointed to a move in [oil stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) early this year. It was one of the few places of strength with a falling market. But did they already burn out or is the fire just getting started?


XOP: Relative Strength In A Falling Market
------------------------------------------


There are many proxies for oil stocks performance in general. You could go with the United States Oil Fund ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)), which tracks the moves in oil prices. Or you could go with a number of ETFs, like the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explorers & Producers ETF ([XOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOP)), which is filled with the companies involved with oil and gas exploration and production.


Using XOP as our proxy, the oil stocks looked poised to move at the beginning of the year **(1)**. After a test of the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) **(2)**, oil stocks challenged their highs again by February **(3)**.


Though XOP didn't move immediately, it didn't give up much ground either. As the ETF flattened and held above its 50-day line, the market indexes looked much worse as they trended below their [21-day lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Meanwhile, a number of the oil stocks in XOP started looking even stronger.


Oil Stocks Fuel Big Gains
-------------------------


Market indexes undercut lows and dramatically reversed higher on Feb. 24, as Russia invaded Ukraine. Just a few days later, XOP launched to new highs along with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) and with above-average volume **(4)**. We entered XOP on SwingTrader at this point to participate in the move in oil stocks.

We immediately saw gains and took our first third profit the next day with a 3.5% gain **(5)**. A few days later we took another third profit on XOP with a 7% gain from our entry **(6)**.


Then oil stocks started to lose steam. Two consecutive days saw solid gains diminish by the close **(7)**. We gave our XOP position room since it was still holding above the 5-day line; we had over a 10% profit, and we only had a third position remaining.


A Profitable Exit And Potential New Setup
-----------------------------------------


We exited the position after XOP dropped through both its 5- and 10-day moving average lines **(8)**. Even with the drop in oil stocks, our final exit still had a 5% gain from our entry.


The pullback made sense as oil stocks simply got overextended. But as the S&P 500 triggered a follow-through day Wednesday, XOP found support at its 21-day line.


A lot of the action gravitated toward beaten down names, especially in the tech area. But the relative strength is still compelling in oil stocks and the bounce in XOP shouldn't be ignored **(9)**. Buying beaten down stocks in downtrends is much harder. Taking advantage of pullbacks in stocks with uptrends has historically been a safer strategy.


That's not to say there aren't challenges. Especially with a headline-driven market holding enormous sway with oil stocks. Still, from a technical basis, these are the setups we gravitate toward for swing trading.

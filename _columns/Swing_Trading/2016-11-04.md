  After Nine Days Down, Is It Time For A Bounce?

As the Nasdaq composite notched its ninth consecutive loss on Friday, the natural expectation would be that it's time for a bounce. There is often a strong temptation to try and sneak in early, thinking you can catch the bottom tick (helpful hint: that's not likely).


A more prudent course of action is to be ready for a bounce but only take action on sufficient evidence. Your patience won't get you the bottom tick but there is still a lot of money to be made between the bottom and the top tick.


So what's an investor to do while waiting for a bottom? There is nothing wrong with sitting on the sidelines. A little post-analysis on the Past Trades in IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) product, reconfirms the importance of the market direction in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). The biggest gains were in names that were selected when the market action showed an Uptrend. Positions initiated when the Market Action was listed as Sideways had a much higher failure rate.


The one notable exception is when the market is showing signs of a reversal. Stocks can start breaking out, or more frequently show reversals themselves, slightly ahead of a change back to Uptrend in the Market Action. That can serve as evidence a change is in the making.


Take the market action around the Brexit vote. There was a quick, sharp plunge immediately following the vote **(1)** after weeks of sideways movement. On June 28, the market saw a strong reversal **(2)** clearing the high of the previous day. This is your first piece of evidence of a potential market turn. You also had confirming action from a number of stocks. That offered another piece of evidence. In fact, three stocks were added to SwingTrader on June 28 and another one on June 29. The market action wasn't changed until June 30, when the market had recovered more of the lost ground and the stock selections were making strong progress **(3)**.


All four of those early decisions proved to be winners. **MarketAxess** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)) and **Silver Wheaton** ([SLW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLW)) were eventually closed out for gains of 7.7% each, **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) saw a 4.7% gain, and the stock added on June 29, **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), was up 6.7%.


Fast forward to today. The market action has been in a Sideways Trend since Sept. 26, the last 30 trading days **(4)**. As a reminder, in a Sideways Trend, limited trading and reduced position sizes help diminish risk when the failure rates are higher for new positions. After eight consecutive days down, the Nasdaq composite tried to stage a reversal on Friday **(5)**, but succumbed to selling pressure by the end of the day. That means patience is still required.


For the next week, look closely for setups showing strength and the market for confirmation. A big plunge into the market isn't necessary, but those first few test probes can start you off on the right foot for a new rally.

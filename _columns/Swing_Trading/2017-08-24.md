In relationships, when a person breaks your trust, they may never get a second chance. In [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), however, you may miss out on a lot of profits if you avoid stocks that have burned you in the past. It's useful to remember that stocks aren't people.




You could take the position that a stock handing you a loss is never worth revisiting. But there are plenty of cases where, for whatever reason, the timing is just slightly off. Maybe the market was still putting pressure on the stock, or it just needed a little more time to carve out a longer [handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) in its [base pattern](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F4nXhvibn0ZUvcnMICSQiOKKeJ6BhtP3UROnwB8HutU/edit#gid=0). If your original thesis is still valid and the stock sets up, it can be worth it to try again.


Take the action in **Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) from a year ago. The stock was added to IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on June 7 as it was breaking out of a seven-week base **(1)**. Volume was the highest in over a month, but below average, a black mark for a base that long. A few days later, the stock closed below its 5-day moving average line and it was removed with a 1.2% loss **(2)**. The market was also flattening at this time and went through a mild correction. Removing the stock prevented a loss of 6% over the next couple weeks and the tumult of the "Brexit" vote.


After Brexit, however, the market quickly reversed and provided a lot of opportunities. Abiomed was one of the participants and picking the stock up on June 28 **(3)** saw a 10% increase over the next 10 days. The stock didn't make it on the SwingTrader list that time due to a dance card that was already full — names like **MarketAxess** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)), **Dycom** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)), and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) provided their own 10% returns. But the stock did stay on our radar.


On July 29, Abiomed [reversed](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) from a two-week pullback and was added to SwingTrader **(4).** We had a loss on our first attempt, missed out on a second attempt, but we were still OK adding it, even 15% above our last exit. Since we had the quick and robust post-Brexit gains locked in, we were happy to take a quick 5% gain in just over a week's time. Abiomed was removed on strength **(5)** on Aug. 9. After inching up a bit more, it went through another pullback to its 50-day line. If it hadn't been sold into strength, the exit would have come a few days later on Aug. 16 as it fell below its 5-day moving average.

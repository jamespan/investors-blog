Saint Augustine of Hippo noted that familiarity breeds contempt. However, in swing trading, familiarity can breed profits. Knowing the personality of a stock can make it easier to trade. Watching it closely can reveal multiple chances for profit as a stock makes its way higher. That was the case with multiple trades in Roku stock this year. The last trade was worth 7% in just under a week.




Swing Trading Example: Roku Stock
---------------------------------


**Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) already demonstrated its ability to make a move. A strong move this summer lent itself to a [profitable swing trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/roku-stock-buy-high-sell-higher-works/) of 10% after its [earnings report from second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q2-2019-roku-stock/). A couple of weeks before that, we saw a quick 2.5% profit in Roku stock. Could we do it again?


We sat out the steep decline of 44% but saw another opportunity during the recovery. A 44% correction might seem excessive. But at the low point of the steep correction, Roku stock was still up more than 100% for the year. As streaming entertainment sees more entries, Roku stands to benefit as a way to access many different platforms in one place.


Another Entry With A Familiar Friend
------------------------------------


On its road to recovery, Roku stock made its way back above its 50-day moving average line and a short-term downtrend **(1).** We added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 133.55 expecting a quick trade. We noted in our trade setup that third quarter earnings were due in less than two weeks.


The next day saw nearly a 10% gain in the stock **(2)**. Bank of America's Merrill Lynch initiated coverage on Roku stock with a price target of 154. We took half profits early in the day at [our 5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/). As usual we [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/). That way if the surge was short lived and reversed, we could still walk away with a profit.


Later the same day, Roku stock hit our 10% profit goal at 146.91. Rather than take profits on the remaining position, we decided to see if we could get a little more out of the stock.


Locking In Profits While You Have Them
--------------------------------------


A couple of days later, Roku stock hit a high of 151.48, 13% above our initial entry **(3)**. With earnings around the corner, we didn't want to give the stock much room. Roku stock can move down even faster than it moves up so we wanted to lock in profit. We certainly didn't want to see it come all the way down to our 1% raised stop. No reason to give up that much profit. The next day, Roku pulled back along with the market **(4)**. We exited the trade while we were still up 9% from our entry.


The risk of a consolidation period or a pullback before earnings was too great. By the time Roku stock closed decisively below its five-day moving average line **(5)**, it was only up 5% from our entry. Greed for more might tempt a trader to hold through earnings. After all, the last three earnings reports saw Roku stock surge more than 20% the next day. But again, it's a big risk and the stock can just as easily fall 20% in a day (and it has!). Holding through earnings is not a strategy used in swing trading.


In this case, [Roku came out with its third quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q3-2019-roku-stock/) and fell sharply the next day **(6)**. Though beating estimates, Roku stock fell 16%, sliced through its 50-day moving average, and ended more than 10% below our entry. Avoiding the emotion of greed paid off as we kept a healthy gain from holding just under a week.

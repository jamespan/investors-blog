Even the best stocks don't go up every day. As a [swing trader](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), you want to capture as many of the up days as you can in a short period while avoiding the down or sideways periods. Using short-term moving averages as a sell rule provides an objective and consistent strategy to not only [cut losses](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) but also protect profits once you have them.


Since the holding period of swing trades is only a few weeks at most, the five- or 10-day moving average is more relevant than the 50-day line, which you might use for a longer-term trade. Lately, we have focused our attention on the five-day line as the current market environment consists of shorter rallies and shallow corrections.


You can give the stock some room if it trades under the line intraday or even closes slightly below the line. However, when it looks like a decisive close below the moving average is imminent — approaching 1% or more below the line at the end of the trading day — it's usually a good time to part ways with the stock. The stock may recover to new heights, but it usually needs time and makes the trade less attractive to hold. You should also have a line in the sand where you will take profit no matter what time of day it is. When profits are deteriorating quickly, you may need to stop the bleeding before it gets worse.


Take a recent trade in **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) added the stock after it pulled back to its 50-day moving average and bounced strongly in higher volume **(1)**. Netflix was trading at 173.42 when added, which was already a 2.7% gain for the day. It might seem too late at that point, but often the best performers start with the biggest gains. By the close, the stock was already up nearly 1% from our entry.


A rising five-day moving average contained the move of Netflix for nearly a month with only two closes below the line. The first was only 0.2% below the line **(2)** and the second was 0.4% below **(4)**.  When a stock closes that near the line, it can be held, especially when you are already ahead by a few percentage points.


Netflix reached its first profit goal of 5% on Sept. 11, and we took half profits at 182.10 **(3).** The goal shifted to a 10% gain for the remaining shares since that was right around the stock's previous high. It got close but suffered a sharp loss Sept. 25, leading to removal of the remaining shares early in the day at 182.20 **(5)**. Netflix was already 2% below its five-day moving average and saw a 9.5% profit dwindle back down to 5%.  Waiting until the end of the day to exit would have cost an additional 2%.


As a result, we avoided sideways action over the next six days and could have even re-entered the stock at a similar price when it began moving in heavier volume this past week **(6)**. But with earnings looming we opted to pass on the breakout.

When you think of highflying stocks, steelmakers aren't usually top of mind. But Nucor stock more than doubled this year. Here's how we handled its latest surge using our [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) strategy.




Swing Trading Example: Nucor Stock
----------------------------------


**Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) and group mate **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)) have been among the top 10 gains for [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) this year. We went for [STLD stock in a classic break of a mild downtrend in April](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/why-we-took-profits-into-strength-on-stld-stock/). After its rise, many of the steel stocks consolidated in a normal fashion so they stayed on our radar.


Nucor stock had a mild pullback after forming a cup formation and Aug. 8 looked like a setup day **(1)**. In this mild pullback, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) didn't give up much ground **(2)**.


We added Nucor stock to SwingTrader as it broke above resistance from Aug. 3 and volume increased **(3)**. Like our previous experience with STLD stock, the gains came quickly on Nucor. We took a third of our profits the next day as we already had a 5% gain **(4)**. One more day and we had a 15% gain from our entry so we took another third **(5)**.


Avoiding Drawdowns With Swing Trading
-------------------------------------


Like so many past examples, a move that strong rarely lasts without a pullback. Our first warning sign came on Aug. 13 as Nucor stock stretched into new highs but closed in the lower half of its range **(6)**. We were already down to just a third of our position and while Nucor closed well off its highs, it was still above the 40% closing range for the day with a gain of 0.74%.

The next day saw the first breach of the [5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) during Nucor's short run, but the stock closed above the line and near its peak for the day **(7)**. So we gave it a bit more room.


We exited the remainder of our position on Aug. 17 when the stock moved below the previous day's low **(8)**. By the end of the day, it was a decisive close below the 5-day line.


Many times we'll switch to the 10-day line as an area to take the remaining profits. But when a stock moves that fast, it can take a little longer for the 10-day line to catch up. The 5-day line keeps it tighter and reduces the drawdown but you may suffer more shakeouts. In the case of Nucor stock, it eventually did close below the 10-day line **(9)** a couple of days later and our early exit saved us from taking a larger drawdown.

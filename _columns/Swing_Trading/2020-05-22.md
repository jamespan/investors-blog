It's one of the facts of trading. No matter how good the setup or the company, not all [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) work. So how did swing trading BlackRock stock end as a profitable trade with a failed breakout? This is where reversals can help.




Swing Trading Example: BlackRock Stock
--------------------------------------


Many people outside of the financial community may have never heard of **BlackRock** ([BLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)). But most are familiar with their iShares ETFs. With nearly an $80 billion market capitalization, it's not the size you might think of for swing trading. But sometimes the big companies can give a nice profit in a short amount of time.


As we looked for increased exposure following a short pullback in the market in mid-May, BlackRock stock stood out. It actually started reversing on May 13 just before the market did **(1)**. It got support right around its 50- and 200-day moving average lines and moved sharply higher, even with a down day in the market.


A classic [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) in the market took hold the next day. It had a wide spread, undercut the previous day's low, and closed high in its trading range. The stock market move sent BlackRock shares up solidly as well **(2)**. We used the previous day's high as a place for an entry and added BlackRock stock on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(2).** While BLK didn't have all the elements, it certainly had the feel of a reversal with strong support at its moving averages. And the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) moved to near-term highs **(2)** ahead of the stock price.

The next day **(3)**, BlackRock stock cleared its high from the previous week and was just shy of a breakout above its April high. Notably volume increased solidly as the stock kept powering higher.


Protecting Profits With Partial Sells
-------------------------------------


BlackRock met our expectations by breaking out the next day **(4)**. So why were we selling? As a general rule we like to trim some profits when a stock hits our [5% profit goal.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) Lately, we've been trimming by one-third. It gives you the bulk of the position left in case the gains continue. But with partial profits locked in, you have a better chance of exiting profitably even if the stock starts coming in on you. Also, to adjust for extra volatility lately, we've been moving our stop up to our entry price rather than our normal [1% profit from our entry for a raised stop](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/).


The stock advanced as much as 2% higher than our trim that day, but it closed lower than the partial exit. It's not the type of action you like to see on a breakout with a close at the lows of the day. A buy near the open left you down on the shares by the close. However, our early entry and partial exit gave us the space to hold.


As the weakness continued the next day we exited the remaining position in BlackRock stock **(5)**. The combination of our early entry, the partial exit and keeping the remaining shares positive left us up 2.7% on the trade in a week's time. The failed breakout doesn't have to result in losses.

In a stock market correction, it's not easy to make headway in your portfolio. Don't fret. Focus on your defense as you try limited positions during potential uptrends. That was the approach we took to [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) Herbalife stock and Euronet Worldwide stock.




The stock market saw a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) on Nov. 28 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell used the phrase ["just below neutral"](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-chairman-jerome-powell-fed-rates-neutral-dow-jones/) to describe the current take on the Fed Funds Rate. A follow-through day signals a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. Using IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) strategy [avoided most of the stock market correction](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-swing-trading/) so we used the signal to start swing trading again. We added **Euronet Worldwide** ([EEFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EEFT)) stock on the follow-through day and then started **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) stock with a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/improving-position-with-an-initial-half-purchase/) the next day **(1)**.


Swing Trading Example: Herbalife Stock
--------------------------------------


An attractive element of Herbalife was the [tight action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/) in its chart. While the stock market made new lows in November, Herbalife stock held well above its lows and traded tightly along its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) line. We started with a half position as it broke above an area of resistance around 55.50 **(1).** As Herbalife continued to make progress, almost another percent up, we brought it to a full position later the same day **(2).**[Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-speaks-volumes-for-trades/) ended at its heaviest level in nearly four months **(3)**confirming the strength of the price action.


After a few days, progress continued in the stock market and in Herbalife. But it didn't last as Dec. 4 dealt a heavy blow to the nascent rally. Recent [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) failed and the stocks with swing trading setups developed flaws. Herbalife stock remained above its initial entry, but the short-term prospects lost their shine.

CLOSE




By the end of the day we took action. Removing Euronet Worldwide stock was an easy call. It was [decisively below its 5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) so it triggered one of our swing trading sell rules and we took a small loss. Herbalife looked like it would close below its 5-day moving average as well, but less than half a percent **(4)**. That's not enough to dictate an automatic sell. But the stock market action factors into swing trading decisions as well.


With recent rallies showing quick failures, we took the cautious approach and removed Herbalife stock rather than risk a loss. The next trading day, it traded down nearly 2% at its lows **(5),** putting it firmly in negative territory. While Herbalife is still holding up relatively well, it's still trading mostly below its 5-day moving average line. The additional risk of stock market headwinds makes it hard to fault the decision.


Making gains in your portfolio is certainly a top priority in swing trading. When profits don't materialize or get lost, it's frustrating. However, [preserving capital](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-early-new-relic-stock/) also deserves high consideration as does protecting your psychology. Letting losses go too far can make you timid in the next potential turn and stunt your progress if you start working with fewer dollars. Not getting hurt when a rally fizzles keeps you in the game.

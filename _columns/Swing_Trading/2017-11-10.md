One of the most distinguishing characteristics of a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategy is time. The time needed for consolidations is shorter, the [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-averages-can-help-lock-in-stock-profits/) use shorter periods, and of course, the holding time is shorter.


That means a trade is not always given the time to develop to its full potential. You may have a picked a good company, but it needs more time before it's ready to make its big move. However, more often than not, moving on from a trade rather than giving it time can give you a new opportunity that is ready to go now. Just as important, it can protect you from holding a stock with little profit while risking the possibility of sideways action or, even worse, a significant fall.


Take **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)), a small gain recently taken on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). Its entry was on Oct. 3 after a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-stock-breakout-strategies-have-familiar-rules/) **(1)** from a seven-week consolidation. There was a little trouble at the start as Stamps closed in the lower part of it trading range for the day, even considering the [gap up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) from the previous day. It's preferable to see immediate strength and profit after a purchase but unfortunately, it doesn't always happen that way.


After a week of tight sideways action, Stamps finally seemed to be gaining traction but then wiped out the progress in a single day **(2)**. We exited the trade to keep our 1% profit rather than letting it turn negative, like it did shortly after our exit.


While a position trade might give a stock eight weeks to perform, a swing trade shouldn't see much more than eight trading days without progress. It took Stamps a full week after our exit to make a new closing high **(3)** and even with that move, it was just over 3% profit in over three weeks. That isn't nearly enough progress for that amount of time.


Just a few days later, and even that small amount of progress disintegrated after nearly a 7% drop in one day **(4)**. On any time frame, the action was problematic because it was the highest volume in over eight weeks, wiping out any profit from the October breakout.


Stamps did attempt a recovery but the volume paled compared to the selling. Even that progress disappeared as the stock fell back to 220 the day before earnings. With so little profit cushion, there wasn't any way to justify holding the stock through earnings. That decision avoided more than a 20% the trading day following its earnings announcement **(5)**.


From the swing trader's perspective, the 1% profit booked early was better than the risk of holding longer. Time just wasn't on the side of Stamps.com.

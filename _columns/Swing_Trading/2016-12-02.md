It's often said, usually in a footnote somewhere, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. But that doesn't mean the past is without value. Having numerous examples of stock behavior gives guidance and context to form expectations. Knowing what is normal behavior and when conditions are reaching extremes may suggest your best course of action, appropriate position sizing, and optimal strategy for approaching the market.


November 2016 seemed to be a month of extremes giving the shorter-term [swing trader](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) some opportunities. It started early when major indexes suffered a nine-day losing streak **(1)** through Nov. 4. For the Nasdaq composite, you had to go back to 1984 to find that many consecutive losses. For the Russell 2000, it happened more recently but still a decade ago in 2006.


A funny thing about extremes is that when you swing so far one way, you tend to swing back the other. The Russell 2000 demonstrated that in November as well. Its losing streak was immediately followed by a 15-day run of gains **(3)**, a feat not accomplished by the index since 1996. [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) product took some solid gains in names like **FreeportMcMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)), [featured in this column two weeks ago](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/could-this-stock-offer-another-profit-opportunity/). But rather than get overly aggressive after 15 days up, SwingTrader turned cautious since the market was due for a correction — which showed up with a vengeance Wednesday.

Another instance of extremes was the divergence between the performance of the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 indexes. After the election, the Russell shot up sharply while the Nasdaq struggled. Normally, in a strong rally, the indexes march together. One may be stronger, but the disparity is not so wide.


Looking at the trailing 10-day performance of the indexes shows how stark the contrast was. On Nov. 14 **(2)**, the Nasdaq was up 1.3% over the last 10 trading days while the Russell 2000 was up 10.2% in the same time period. That 9-percentage-point difference is something that was only seen before in the period between 1999 and 2001. In that case, it wasn't the strength of the Russell 2000 rather it was more a function of the extreme weakness in the Nasdaq tech bubble burst.


The recent sector rotation was probably more of an influence in the difference between indexes rather than the small-cap bias of the Russell. Banks specifically were a shining point that favored the Russell 2000 over the Nasdaq. The difference between indexes was even greater with the Nasdaq 100, which excludes financial stocks.


After a month of extremes, it's no surprise that some investors got a sinking feeling in their stomachs from the swings, but what does it mean for the future? For one thing, a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) style may be preferable if the market remains in a short-term mindset.

  A Market Pullback Could Be A Good Thing For Swing Trades

Leading stocks took some hard hits last week. But the Nasdaq bobbed and weaved to narrowly avoid its first three-day losing streak of 2017.


Still, the market looks poised for some sort of pullback. For psychological indicators, the gap between the bulls and bears from Investors Intelligence has widened to a chasm of optimism. Implied volatility as represented by the VIX, or "fear index," remains near lows. On the technical side, the percentage of stocks above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages has climbed above 70%, and the Nasdaq composite hit a year-to-date gain of 9% this week. Where is the wall of worry to climb?


A pullback here would serve a useful purpose. It brings investors back to Earth a bit before things get out of hand from unfettered optimism where bubbles gestate. More importantly, pullbacks offer more opportunities for profitable [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). We would look for either [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) as stocks consolidate gains, or [reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) as they recover from pullbacks. Usually the reversals come first.


With reversals, we aren't trying to catch the bottom on weak stocks. We are looking for short-term weakness in an overall uptrend. The pullback has to be just right. Too shallow and the stock won't have much to bounce back from. Too deep and it could lead to a bigger breakdown. Signs of relative strength are also a key factor.


**Chemours** ([CC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CC)) in October demonstrates what we would look for in upcoming reversals. The stock was holding nicely above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), and after a brief pullback below its 10-day line, the stock showed a reversal day **(1)**. It was a larger spread than most of the recent action, but the stock was showing relative strength vs. the Nasdaq, which breached its 50-day line.


The next session the stock surpassed the high of the reversal day and closed in the upper part of the range **(2)**. Volume picked up as well, making a strong argument for an entry near the close at 14.94. The next day showed even better price action and the 5% profit level was reached within two days **(3)**. Selling a half-position at that point would lock in gains and the remainder could have been sold at the 10% profit goal a couple days after that **(4)**.


Going for a bigger gain would have been possible, but if the 5- or 10-day line was being used as a sell signal **(5)**, you would have ended up selling at nearly the same price as the 10% profit target. Locking in the gain earlier was the better way to go and would have avoided an extra seven days in the trade with nothing to show for it.

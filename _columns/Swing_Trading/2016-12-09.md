Taking profits quickly is a key tenet of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). You can either sell into strength while the stock is still rising or sell into weakness as it comes off the top. Both come with their challenges. The answer usually boils down to recognizing what the market will give you at the time and noticing when conditions change.


Selling on the way up entails struggling with the "fear of missing out." If you book profits at 5% how do you feel if the stock goes to 10%? You need to temper the greed of getting as much as you can from a stock with a bit of fear that the gains can easily be taken away from you. You may be waiting for 10% gains and letting 5% gains turn flat, or worse, negative.


[IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) product had to grapple with this dilemma recently with **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)). The stock was added to the current trades list as it [broke out](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787) **(1)** on Nov. 16 and was immediately profitable. The following day, half profits were taken as the stock reached the 5% profit goal and the stock kept going, hitting the 10% profit goal later in the day **(2)** . Profits were booked and taking the average of the two exit points left the trade with a 7.71% profit in just one day.


AMD kept going for the next few days vaulting another 11% at its peak **(3)**.It seemed like the one that got away. That led to an adjustment in strategy the next time Advanced Micro Devices presented an opportunity.


On Dec. 6, the stock broke out of another short [consolidation](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736314&sourceid=735787) **(4)** and it seemed awfully familiar when the next day the 5% profit goal triggered early in the morning. Given the strength of the market, and the previous experience of AMD, taking half profits at 5% was postponed to see if more profit could be obtained in the current environment. The stop was still raised to a 1% profit level to make sure that in the case of a reversal, we would still eke out a small profit.


Intraday market weakness thwarted the test. The raised stop was tested **(5)** before midday and the stock exited slightly profitable. By the end of the day, the stock recovered and was able to close in positive territory going on as much as another 11% gain at its peak **(6)**.


The market gave its feedback on the test. It's still an environment where booking half profits at 5% makes sense. The Monday morning quarterback could easily play the stock better by bending the rules "this one time." But while you may get away with bending the rules every now and then, the lack of discipline usually is costly in the long run.

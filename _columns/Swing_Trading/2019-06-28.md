The second quarter of 2019 was very different from the first. The Nasdaq composite jumped 16.5% in the first quarter and finishes the second quarter with just another 3.6% of progress. The [China trade war](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/how-trump-china-trade-war-could-wreck-us-economy/) deserves a lot of the blame for the disparity.




China Trade War Sparks Stock Market Correction
----------------------------------------------


[China trade war headlines dominated the beginning of May](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/market-outlook-worsens-on-trade-war-reasons-to-treat-the-drop-more-seriously/) and led to what we call a "vertical violation" on May 13 **(1)**. A couple of weeks later the Nasdaq composite was looking at nearly an 11% stock market correctionfrom its April peak. You could consider it part of a handle to the deeper bear market of the final quarter in 2018.


Stocks rallied on June 4 after [Fed Chairman Powell projected readiness to act in case recession signs appeared](https://www.investors.com/news/federal-reserve-bank-stocks-rally-jerome-powell-soothing-commentary/) **(2)**. Taking advantage of the move in individual stocks wasn't easy, however. We were already cautious because vertical violations tend to need time to resolve themselves. We also know that the first [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/) afterward has a high failure rate. And the China trade war issues were far from resolved. In fact, it looked like any progress would have to wait until the end of June. That made us still a little cautious when the Nasdaq composite notched a follow-through day on June 7 **(3)**.


Immediately after the follow-through day, the next obstacle from a technical standpoint was the 50-day moving average line. The line often acts as support in an uptrend but can act as resistance after a downtrend. That was the case as the Nasdaq composite hit resistance for a little over a week **(4).** When the Nasdaq composite crossed above that level, it did so with gusto **(5)**. We had good news on the China trade war front as President Donald Trump referred to a "very good" phone chat with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It led to a step up in our buying for IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), but we didn't get fully invested as many of the setups were extended by that point.


Weakness Returns To The Stock Market
------------------------------------


Leaders started showing weakness just a few days later **(6)**, particularly software and other tech names. That culminated in a sharp drop on June 25 where the Nasdaq composite sliced through its short-term five- and ten-day moving average lines **(7).** It also saw many swing trades undercutting their stop losses. We've seen some recovery in individual stocks but over the last few days **(8)**, the index hasn't been able to cross back above the highs of June 25. That line in the sand also corresponds to the 8000 level, a problem area in the last year. So far, the Nasdaq hasn't been able to hold above 8000 for more than a couple of weeks above when it first crossed above it in Aug. 2018 or when it tried again in April 2019.


Holding at that level makes sense as investors adopted a wait-and-see approach to the China trade war. President Trump is set to meet with President Xi Jinping. A deal that doesn't escalate tariffs from current levels while talks continue would match expectations, even though it doesn't create any more certainty for future talks. Nor does it address fears that the tariffs could bring strain to the global economy, which might already be tipping toward recession. But even kicking the can down the road is preferable to the saber-rattling that put pressure on the market in May.


Where Do We Go From Here?
-------------------------


Many stocks that broke out pulled back to their buy points, like **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)). You also have stocks adding handles to their bases, like **Epam Systems** ([EPAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EPAM)) and **Dexcom** ([DXCM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DXCM)). A stock market catalyst, like a positive report on China trade war news, could provide a shot in the arm for these stocks. Now that the Nasdaq is back above 8000 can it hold it? If so, volume-backed reversals and breakouts could provide the next [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) opportunities.

There is a reason traders often say, "don't get married to your stocks." The fact is stocks are fickle and offer very little in the way of loyalty to you, no matter how great a person you are. While you would never get a divorce from your spouse for having a bad week (hopefully), the same rules shouldn't apply to your stocks.


IBD generally uses trend-following systems for finding stock ideas, but we recognize a stock's price movement reflects many factors — market gyrations, industry and sector movements, news and even tweets from the White House — any of which can derail a stock from its trend. With the shorter time frame of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), you need to be especially in tune with changes in a stock's character. That might mean veering from your original trading plan to adjust to new realities in your stock's prospects.


Take a recent trade on [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), **Williams-Sonoma** ([WSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WSM)) that set up a [short](https://www.investors.com/short-selling/) trade earlier this month. The retail sector is in a long-term downtrend and the home furnishings group, to which Williams Sonoma belongs, was in the bottom 25 out of 197 groups for nearly two months.


The stock itself was in a downtrend since the summer of 2015. After a short postelection pop, it found itself back below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. At the end of February, Williams-Sonoma was making another attempt to get above its long term trend lines but on March 6, the stock fell sharply and reversed course **(1)**. The stock was put on SwingTrader that day as a short sale at 48.86, down nearly 3% on the day with volume well above average.


As a reminder, with a short sale you borrow shares from your broker to sell and hope to buy them at a lower price. The difference in price is your profit when the stock goes down and a loss when the stock goes up.


Williams-Sonoma was going in the right direction but after a second day **(2)** where the stock was up over 1% on volume, the decision was made to exit the trade on March 10 at 48.27. The gain of 1.2% may not seem like much but there were some reasons to be cautious. The Nasdaq composite showed a reversal the day before on March 9, the retail industry was showing a bounce that was getting passed on to the stock, the stock was in danger of closing above its 5-day moving average, and on March 8 the company set their earnings announcement for the next week.


Enough factors had changed the risk/reward ratio that an exit seemed prudent. The stock did drop another 3% at its low, but quickly reversed **(3)** and never came close to hitting the 5% profit goal. For those who stuck with the stock, revenue missed expectations but earnings beat and loyalty was punished with a negative trade **(4)**.

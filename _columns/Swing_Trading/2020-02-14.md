Most of IBD's material is focused on position trades. These can be as short as days when they don't work and as long as years when they do. [Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) has many similar elements. The biggest difference is the time element. But often you'll find that leading stocks, like LULU stock, will have elements of both.




LULU Stock: A Winning Position Trade Turned Swing Trade
-------------------------------------------------------


**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) burst onto the scene over a decade ago with a huge move after the Financial Crisis of 2008. But then it had years of underperformance, until a resurgence in 2018. That year it was a top performer on IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). LULU stock rejoined Leaderboard in September and is up more than 25% since then. It recently formed a three-weeks-tight pattern and that's often an opportunity to add to a current position. But is it a good place to start a new position?


This is where swing trading can be useful. With a shorter time frame and smaller profit goal expectations, you can enter into these setups with limited risk. We put Lululemon stock on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 245.50 as it broke a little downtrend in a tight area **(1)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) was one of the compelling features as it was back at new highs **(2)**. Trading volume was below average but at its highest level in nearly a month **(3)**.


As a swing trade, we lowered our risk to just 2.2% using the low of the entry day as our stop. We could also use a decisive close below the [five-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) as a guide for a stop. Early in a trade, that can help limit losses. After you have some profit, a rising five-day line can help you protect it.


An Early Test In Lululemon Stock
--------------------------------


Later in the week, LULU stock saw a 1.7% drop in a day **(4)**. It was a poor close at the lows of the day and below the five-day line. But it was right at the line, not decisively below it. The stock price remained in the same area the next two days as the five-day line rose and even then, LULU stock remained within a percent of the line **(5)**. More importantly it was closing in a tight range with volume trending lower **(5)**. That action suggested the selling was exhausted.


The hold proved to be a good decision as Lululemon picked up the pace from there. A few days later it approached our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/)**(6)**. We locked in half profits a little early at 262.62, but by the end of the day the stock got weaker. It looked poised to close in the lower half of the range and we already had nearly two weeks of holding LULU stock, so we removed the remaining shares.


Can A SwingTrader Become A Position Trade?
------------------------------------------


Lululemon stock is still a position on Leaderboard since it's still working as a position trade. One could even decide to consider the cushion from swing trading as an opportunity to change to a position trade. But be careful changing your goals midstream. When you are up on a stock, you have the flexibility to extend your profit goals and time frames.


But don't fall into the trap of justifying a losing position. When you are down on a stock and triggering your predetermined sell rules, that is not the time to change your rules to justify holding. The decision to change a swing trade to a position trade in that case might be an attempt to avoid the reality of your loss.

The [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) has left many stock charts in tatters. Still it's important to stay engaged by keeping watchlists updated with names like **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)). Sure you can make money buying beaten down names as they bounce, but that isn't our [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) game. Relative strength is our focus and VRTX stock fit the bill.




Relative Strength Line Was Key Indicator on VRTX Stock
------------------------------------------------------


In a bear market, a key indicator to recognize is a powerful [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). This is where new leadership tends to come from. It's what attracted us to VRTX stock on [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). Compare its move to the general stock market.


VRTX stock topped with the general market **(1)** on Feb. 19. It's first leg down and subsequent rally was an early clue of strength. VRTX stock fell 13.7%, then rallied back above the 50-day moving average line **(2)**. The Nasdaq composite, by contrast, fell 16% to its 200-day moving average line. The S&P 500 a similar amount and both indexes' rebound during that time period fell far short of the 50-day line. Score one for VRTX stock.

On March 18, markets tried to put in a bottom and VRTX stock did as well **(3)**. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both undercut their March 18 lows, but Vertex held above it. Score another one for VRTX stock. As a result, the relative strength line was soaring even with the stock 21% off its high. The support came from multiple levels. The 200-day moving average line, the 200 price level and the top of its previous base. It was a good place to make a stand.


Vertex Stock Makes Early Move Above 50-day Moving Average
---------------------------------------------------------


On March 31, Vertex was getting well established above its 50-day moving average line and the relative strength line was back in new high ground **(4)**. It wasn't a good day to buy, however, because the general market looked ripe for a pullback as it hit resistance at its 21-day moving average and showed a [downside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/). We were also still in a market correction and waiting for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/).


On April 2, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite looked like they could trigger a follow-through day **(5)**. On that day, VRTX stock cleared the high of a couple days prior **(4).**We had an alert ready to send putting it on SwingTrader, but held off. The Nasdaq composite was falling short on volume, which must be higher than the prior day, a key follow-through requirement. The S&P 500 did hit the follow-through day criteria and [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) moved back to confirmed uptrend. But there were caveats. It didn't have the power you would expect.


A Familiar Feeling
------------------


The next week, things shifted. The Nasdaq composite had its own follow-through day and both major indexes were crossing above the highs of March 31 and the 21-day moving average line. VRTX stock, meanwhile, broke out into new high territory **(6)** and we added it to SwingTrader at 250.13. We were still being cautious since we know the failure rate of the first follow-through day is high after a [vertical violation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/vertical-violations-help-avoid-bear-market/) correction. So, Vertex was just a [half position](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) to start.


We were rewarded the next day with a strong move. It quickly put us at our 5% profit goal **(7)** and a familiar decision. Just a week before, we had a half position in **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) where [we didn't take half profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cloudflare-stock-strong-gain-didnt-last-coronavirus-stock-market-crash/). Our reasoning was we didn't want to drop the stock down to a measly quarter position. This time, we decided to [take the half profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) at 262.93. We also [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry. Like Cloudflare stock, VRTX stock had a big downside reversal along with the market. We took the remaining profits when we hit our raised stop. We expect weakness to follow and for swing trading, it's best to avoid sitting through the weakness.


The markets staged a big expectation breaker to the upside by shrugging off their downside reversal. However, VRTX stock wasn't so lucky. It finished the week below our exit and would have turned negative on us. Our early action kept our quick trade profitable.

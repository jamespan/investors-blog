The past week was tough on many leading groups. Specifically energy, materials and industrials took hits. But taking profits into strength in Teck stock was one way we protected our [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) profits.




Swing Trading Example: Teck Stock
---------------------------------


**Teck Resources** ([TECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TECK)) sticks with a swing trading theme we've returned to a number of times this year. Miners and materials continue to be among our repeat winners this year.


We added Teck stock to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) after it cleared a downtrend line and a prior area of resistance **(1)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) was moving up well **(2)** and volume came in strong at our entry. Not only that, the volume remained strong the next few days as the price continued higher.


A general rule in our swing trading approach is to take some profits quickly into strength. In this case, we took a third off with a 5% gain **(3)** and another third when that expanded to nearly 10% profit the following day **(4)**.

Sure, the early profit taking runs the risk of being lightly invested in a big winner. But the early selling also gives you some flexibility. You can give a stock more room to pull back without risking the trade going negative on you.


A Downside Reversal Warning
---------------------------


Three days after our entry in Teck stock, we nearly hit a 15% gain at the peak **(5)**. For swing trading, that could be enough right there. The action in Teck stock was concerning. The strong gains were lost by the end of the day and then some.


Downside reversals like this are ominous for swing trading as they usually suggest weakness to follow. However, because we had locked in profits already we felt we could allow Teck stock the room to test its 10-day moving average line.


Teck stock touched its 10-day moving average line and found support **(6)**. The rebound looked promising and in a week's time we were nearly back to new high ground **(7)**. Even the small pullback that followed didn't set off any swing trading alarms **(8)**. Volume lessened, the stock closed high in its trading range and looked unwilling to give up ground.


But when Teck stock plunged the next day **(9)**, we didn't want to risk our earlier profits hoping for a bounce. Sharp drops usually need recovery time and time is precious with swing trading. We also didn't want to risk Teck stock getting worse.


Because of our early profit taking, our average exit price ended up as a swing trading win with over a 6% gain in under two weeks.

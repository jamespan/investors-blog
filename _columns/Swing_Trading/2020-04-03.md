The coronavirus stock market crash has spared few stocks. But during rally attempts we've tried test positions in some of the stronger stocks. Cloudflare stock was the most recent [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) winner with a gain that didn't last.




Swing Trading Example: Cloudflare Stock
---------------------------------------


**Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)) was notable for its strength during the most recent bear market. When the stock market correction started to unfold, Cloudflare stock was at new highs **(1)**. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were each down 10% or more from their highs on that same day.


However, Cloudflare stock wasn't entirely spared. It still fell nearly 40% by March 16. But within three days **(2)** it rebounded 54% and was back above its 10-, 21- and 50-day moving average lines. It was a position only a few stocks could claim. Many of them had direct benefits from the implications of a spreading Covid-19.


Certain companies benefit from "safer-at-home" directives. Working from home requires online security and traffic optimization that is a specialty of Cloudflare. It was discussed in depth on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&src=A00433A&refcode=pdsoc%7Cggl%7Cibdlive%7C2019%7C11%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C985802&intcode=invstcntnartcls|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|682843) that day as the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) skyrocketed to new highs **(2)**.

Cloudflare stock went sideways for a few days and the 23.18 high of March 19 became the resistance area to watch **(2)**. We did try and sneak in a little early by adding it to SwingTrader as a half position when it cleared resistance at 22.50 on an intraday chart **(3)**. We exited quickly on the same day when the stock reversed.


When Cloudflare stock broke above 23.18 we added it back on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as a half position **(4).** The trading volume was the highest in over two weeks **(4)**. Also, the Nasdaq composite nearly triggered a follow-through day, only missing on the volume component. You have to be willing to buy a stock back even if it burned you in the past. This time the gains came quickly.


Half Positions Reduce Risk But Have Challenges
----------------------------------------------


We've been testing the market with a few [half positions](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/) on SwingTrader during the bear market. We've limited our occasional exposure on average to less than 5% invested since the market topped in February. As a result, we've [minimized the drawdown on performance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-swing-trading-performance/).


But when Cloudflare stock neared 10% the next day **(5)**, we had a bit of a dilemma. We would normally [take partial profits at 5%](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) and see what we can get from the rest. But since we started at a half position, would the amount left be too little? We sent an alert to subscribers that we would [raise our stop to a 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry but not take profits.


A little later, Cloudflare stock hit our 10% profit goal. This time our alert to subscribers said that profits could be booked here, but we would still hold. It was one of the better looking charts out there. However, the stock showed a [downside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) and that changed our mind on the prospects. As it went back through our 5% profit goal we removed the stock from SwingTrader to protect our profits. A bearish reversal sets up an expectation of more weakness to come.


The next day, Cloudflare stock was up but it closed below our exit **(6).**It's remained below that price since then. We'll keep it on our radar and maybe give it another try when the market improves.

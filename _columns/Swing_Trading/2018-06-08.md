Things are going well with your [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) and the money seems to be pouring in. What do you do? Some people get more aggressive. They want to take advantage of their "hot hand." Others get fearful. They don't want to see their gains go away. Charts and rules can guide you when to take profits as **Westlake Chemical** ([WLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WLK)) stock demonstrates.




[Reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) are worthwhile patterns to recognize. Rather than waiting for prior areas of resistance, you can get an earlier and better price. When Westlake Chemical showed a reversal **(1)** on March 2, it missed on a few elements. It was a solid bounce from the [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) but the high fell just short of clearing the previous day's high and the [volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) was weak **(1)**. The next day, however, saw a huge increase in volume, an [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) at new highs, and it cleared resistance at 112.43 **(2)**. This was the day Westlake joined [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) ahead of a higher level at resistance at 115.19.


Take Profits In An Extended Market
----------------------------------


Four days later, we were up 5% on the trade and we took half profits **(3)**. It's our custom to take profits at that level and raise the stop to 1% profit from our entry. This ensures we end the trade with a gain. No reason to let worthwhile profits slip away. But at the same time, we give the stock some room for further gains. The partial sell was more critical because of action in the Nasdaq composite. The index hit new all-time highs on the same day, logging a 14% gain from its February lows. It was also the sixth consecutive daily gain for the Nasdaq. We always use the context of the market to inform us on our individual trades.


The next day Westlake Chemical showed a bearish reversal **(4)**. It was an opportunity to take profits on the remaining position. We don't expect to exit at the very top, but we did manage to exit on the top day in this case, good for an overall gain of 4.76%. Again, the extended nature of the market led to the sell decision. As a result, we missed a two-month correction in Westlake Chemical. The breach of the 5-day moving average **(5)** a few days later was another rule that could be employed to protect profits but the market analysis saved us a couple of extra percentage points.


Selling into strength and taking profits on the way up often avoids corrections and areas of consolidation, at least in the short term. What do you do with the money from the sell? There could be another setup to play and a chance to compound your gains. Or just keeping the cash can take the risk off while you wait for more setups and a more favorable market.


As always, you have to be prepared for some stocks to go up without you after you take profits. That's OK. These rules can still keep you ahead with less risk over the long run.

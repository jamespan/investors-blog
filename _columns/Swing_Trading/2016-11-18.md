Markets have had a week to digest the shift in direction due to the election and so far it has been for the better. [Last week's column](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/letting-postelection-dust-settle-for-next-opportunities/) shared the strategy of waiting for some pullbacks and flattening [patterns](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736314&sourceid=735787), and the markets have seemed to cooperate.


The Nasdaq composite started participating in the move as it established itself above its 50-day moving average and reached new all-time new highs early on Friday. **Proshares Ultra Nasdaq Biotech**  ([BIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIB)), mentioned in last week's column, was subsequently added to [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) watch list on Nov. 16 as it formed a five-day consolidation that is part of a handle to a larger pattern. The ETF continued to pull back to its 10-day moving average on Friday.


The SwingTrader product also got to book a couple profits: a quick, powerful gain on **AMD** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) when a deal with **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) pushed shares up, and a slower, milder gain for **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)). More names working acts as an important confirming data point on an improving market.


Another stock currently being watched is **Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)). This is not the first time the stock has been on the radar of SwingTrader. On April 19, it was put on and quickly gained 5%. The trade ended with a raised stop loss getting triggered and a 1% gain getting booked in two days. But the stock was not forgotten.


After a quick 17% correction, the stock reversed after its earnings report and was put back on the current trades list a short while later on April 26. It saw a more impressive gain of 8% in two days with two profit-taking sells on the way up. This move was the subject of a previous Swing Trading column from July 11 on [industry group moves](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/industry-group-moves-reveal-stock-opportunities/) as both the metal ore miners and gold/silver/gem miners held spots in the top 10 of IBD's 197 industry groups.


Fast-forward to today, and another group move is unfolding. This time, the metal ore miners are flexing their strength as the No. 7 group, but the gold/silver/gem miners are languishing down at No. 184. The movement in metal ore miners is not surprising with Donald Trump's win. The president-elect's promises for infrastructure investment sent many building and material stocks soaring, and copper — the metal of choice for Freeport McMoRan — has been a beneficiary.


Freeport McMoRan has just gotten back to its April highs, meaning this [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) avoided sitting with dead money for half the year. The stock just joined the Leaders List on IBD's Leaderboard product as it broke out of its cup base. It currently looks to be forming a handle.  A breakout that surpasses the high of 14.26, with accompanying volume, could offer a new profit opportunity in the stock.

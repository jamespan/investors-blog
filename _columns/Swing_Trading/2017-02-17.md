You may have dreaded homework in school but it usually paid off come test time. Watch lists are your homework as a trader, and the potential payoff is literal.


A huge benefit of watch lists is your research and decisions can be made ahead of time, helping take your emotions out of the equation. They encourage decisive action when a stock triggers a buy, especially important in a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). The more thinking done ahead of time, including what action to take given different scenarios, the easier and quicker the decision to make the trade.


However,  a final decision shouldn't come until it is time to actually place the trade. Entering a buy stop, an order that will automatically execute if the stock reaches a certain price, is useful for busy or undisciplined traders who might miss opportunities. But how the stock goes through the price and the accompanying volume are critical factors that can only be evaluated when you get there. The downside of the buy stop order is you could get triggered even if volume leaves a lot to be desired.


IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) has been using watch list stocks especially when markets might not be providing ideal conditions. You stay engaged and ready to act, while being cautious. Take **Thor Industries** ([THO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=THO)), a recent watch-list stock that became a profitable trade. The stock has shown a propensity for nice quick moves and was added as a watch-list stock **(1)** on Jan. 31. Thor had just bounced off its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) and was holding the gains well, potentially forming a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/). In the trade setup, the [buy-zone](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) start price was listed just above the high of the handle. We noted that price and volume action would dictate the final decision to trigger a buy for the stock and that buy stop orders were discouraged.


Over the next few days volume trickled in around half its average daily level as the stock continued to hold its gains. While it didn't immediately produce anything actionable, the price and volume were constructive so the watching continued.


On Feb. 8 the stock broke above its buy point **(2)** and was moving quickly at the open, prompting a buy-zone alert. The market was also a factor as the Nasdaq looked to be moving up from a small weeklong consolidation. The entry price at the time of the decision was 106.94, and our first profit goal was set at 5% at 112.29.


In just a couple of days Thor reached 111.40, within a percentage point of the profit goal, and reversed lower, closing 2% off its top **(3)**.  Volume lightened as it pulled back, which gave some comfort. But volume also remained light as the stock rallied back, and stopped, near its previous high **(4)**. That combination, as well as the extended nature of the market, encouraged profits to be taken early at 111.26. While not the full 5% desired, a 4% profit in six days can still add up if done consistently.

The stock market survived the China trade war, recession fears, and tightening monetary policy concerns in 2019. [Will the coronavirus be the catalyst](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-when-thing-going-peak-coronavirus-grips-stock-gurus/) for a stock market correction?


Right now, it's too soon to tell. But the nimbleness of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) can help reduce exposure in the short term and get aggressive should the market shrug it off.




Sell Into Strong Rallies; Avoid Stock Market Corrections
--------------------------------------------------------


First, consider how we got here. Even before the coronavirus took over the headlines, the stock market was already due for a break after a strong December. On IBD's SwingTrader, Dec. 16 saw aggressive buying with four names added that day **(1).**


Less than two weeks later on Dec. 27, we were unwinding five of our positions **(2)** on top of taking profits in two stocks the two days prior. We didn't think a stock market correction was imminent. It was just a matter of selling stocks into strength and booking quick profits. What naturally happens after a stock market run is you end up lightening up along the way. Whether a small pullback or more serious stock market correction unfolds, you are already less exposed.

The risk, of course, is that you lighten up and the stock market continues to run without you. The solution? You just start your buying again as long as the setups keep coming.


January Continues Higher
------------------------


While the Nasdaq composite did pull back a few days, we continued to see constructive setups. On Jan. 2 the buying began in earnest again with another five names added **(3)**. Jan. 6 tested our mettle with a quick sharp pullback **(4)**. Even though a few stocks hit our stop losses at the open, our alert to subscribers instructed a pause before action. Even waiting five minutes can suggest whether the stock market is finding support or not.


In this case, support came quickly at a level we like to see it. Right around the 21-day exponential moving average line. If a rally remains above that line, fears of a stock market correction remain muted. We only removed one name for a loss and took the opportunity to add another four positions that day. That would in effect put us on margin with 10 stocks. We climbed to a high of 14 stocks a couple of days later **(5)**.


That might seem like a lot of activity, but that is also the nature of swing trading. The stops are tighter, which helps reduce the risk. And taking profits along the way reduces exposure on the way up. In fact, just a week later and our profit taking brought us back down to holding just five stocks **(6)**. The stock market started to feel a little heavy and its rise put it at the upper part of its channel lines.


Swing Trading Sidesteps Coronavirus Fears
-----------------------------------------


With an extended market, you never know what will cause a pullback or even a stock market correction. In this case, stocks pulled back on fears of the coronavirus and its potential effect on economic growth. Here again, swing trading can provide some nimbleness to manage your risk. Heading into the weekend, we sent an alert to subscribers calling a sideways trend and suggested reduced trading **(7)**. We were down to just three current trades with one of them a half position. For a portfolio, that would translate to about 25% invested.


As the Nasdaq composite gapped down below its 21-day line, our damage was just a fraction of the loss **(8)**. And while we did buying throughout the week, the weak close on Friday suggested our holdings remain minimal **(9)**. We took profits where we had them and kept losses small on the rest. If the pullback gets more serious and turns into a stock market correction, we'll be well poised to keep the gains of our strong December and January. However, should the market turn around quickly, you will see the aggressive buying resume just as fast.

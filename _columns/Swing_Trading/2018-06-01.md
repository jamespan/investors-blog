It's a hard fact to face sometimes. Not all your [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) are going to work. But cutting losses quickly keeps the damage of any individual trade at a minimum. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) provides an example. Taking action quickly avoided potential heartache down the road. For long-term performance, that gives you a greater chance at success.




Investors had a strong reaction to Chipotle's earnings on April 26, pushing the stock up nearly 25% **(1)**. What really stood out was the [tight action](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-tight-action-reveals-about-a-stocks-potential/) over the next few weeks. The stock hardly gave up any gains. Plus, the declining volume suggested very few investors were selling.


On May 16, Chipotle Mexican Grill cleared its [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) as volume picked up **(2)**. It joined [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on the positive action. Of course, the expectation was for continued gains. However, market weakness contributed to a pullback. The stock hadn't broken its support levels, so cutting it completely seemed unnecessary. But if it couldn't follow up on the strength, could this provide profits quickly?


Cutting Losses Quickly Key For Swing Trades
-------------------------------------------


Reducing the position by half on May 18 acted as a compromise **(3)**. If the weakness continued, the early sell reduces the overall loss. For swing trades, if the losses stay small, it allows the gains to compound and grow your portfolio. If the stock comes back, it can either be repurchased or at the very least turn the trade profitable. In this case, Chipotle Mexican Grill didn't really do either. It didn't see a [decisive close below its 5-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/). But it couldn't seem to rise back above it. The 10-day moving average provided a level of support that seemed to hold. That is, until May 25 **(4)**.


Once Chipotle punctured its 10-day moving average, it was hard to justify holding any longer. Granted, the volume was minimal and the action continued to be tight. But if your stock can't make progress after holding it for more than a week, it's usually time to move on to the next swing trade. Even if the stock doesn't plummet, it may just require more time before it works. There's little reason to risk a downturn in the stock if it needs more time anyway. It's safer in cash, or even better, could be used for another prospect. The fact that the market was mostly sideways during the time made the decision that much easier.


The average gain for IBD SwingTrader in 2018 is close to 5% in an average of seven days. Scaling out with the early sell kept the loss for the entire trade under 2%. The handling of Chipotle reduced the loss of money and time on a nonperforming stock.

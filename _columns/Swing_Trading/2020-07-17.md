You never know when news will give your stock a big boost. Sometimes, the rise is short-lived and it's best to take the gift and move on. But Spotify stock also gave an opportunity for further gains after news. It led to big [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) gains.




Swing Trading Example: Spotify Stock
------------------------------------


If you are in the content creation business, you rely heavily on your content creators. Just look at how**Spotify Technologies** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) jumped after signing an exclusive license for Joe Rogan's popular podcast **(1)**. But the stock only had a few days of gains before consolidating a few weeks.


That consolidation made for a nice swing trading setup and it joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on June 17 as it cleared the previous day's high with a rising relative strength line **(2)**.


The next day saw a big gap up **(3)** on the announcement that [Kim Kardashian West would also join the podcast lineup of Spotify](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/media/kim-kardashian-spotify/index.html). We typically start taking profits at a [5% profit goal,](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) so it seemed prudent to take a one-third profit near our 10% profit goal on the open of the day. Spotify stock ended up rising another 7% that day after our partial exit. The close was strong and our profit cushion grew. That gives the flexibility to hold for a bigger gain. As long as the stock continues to act constructively.


**Selling Some On Weakness**
----------------------------


It's important to be on the lookout for character changes in a stock. As Spotify stock pulled back to its 5-day moving average line, we took another third off **(4)**. We had over a 25% gain from the initial entry and the stock price got weak following the downside reversal from the day before. Our remaining smaller position couldn't have as big of an impact on performance but could still contribute if the stock continued higher. The same concept was used with **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) [discussed in a previous column.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sq-stock-taking-early-profits-made-holding-easier/)

Of course, the downside to [taking profits early](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sq-stock-taking-early-profits-made-holding-easier/) is you miss jumps that happen right after your sell. Spotify stock had another 10% move the next day **(5)**. It's easy to bemoan missing out on the move, but if a stock quickly gives up gains, the smaller position helps avoid panic.


At this point, we certainly could remove the remaining position. But we gave it more room to see if it would continue. With those types of gains, we often [shift our focus from the 5-day moving average line to the 10-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/). Spotify stock got a nice bounce from the 10-day as it flattened out and the line rose to it **(6)**.


Beware Of Character Changes
---------------------------


As Spotify stock made a new closing high **(7)**, our longer hold time seemed justified. It looked poised to potentially move again. And it did, for a short time. The downside reversal on July 13 was a real character change **(8)**. We removed the remaining position as Spotify stock undercut the lows of the prior two days and things got worse from there as it sliced below both the 5- and 10-day moving averages.


While it got a supportive bounce at its 21-day moving average line **(9)**, that required sitting with a 15% loss off the top. Though we gave Spotify more room than usual, it was still a swing trade and the earlier exit was in line with that goal. We were up nearly 40% from our entry and 25% for the trade (considering the earlier exits). If want more, we can always play the stock again.

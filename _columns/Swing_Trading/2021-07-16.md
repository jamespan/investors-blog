Usually [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) focuses on short-term moves of just a few weeks. But we kept KKR stock as a current trade for over a month. Here's why:


Financial stocks had a remarkable comeback from the coronavirus crash. Their relative strength kicked into high gear after November 2020 as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped. But the bank stocks slowed down as the 10-year yield topped in April 2021 and fell again.




Swing Trading Example: KKR Stock
--------------------------------


But with **KKR & Co** ([KKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KKR)), we saw a swing trading opportunity. It doesn't have the yield sensitivity of the banks and we added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on a bounce off the 50-day moving average line **(1)**. Rather than pulling back to the line, KKR stock flattened out around its 21-day moving average line and allowed the 50-day line to catch up to its price.


KKR stock showed strong action off the bounce making progress over the next few days. But our first test came on June 14 on an [outside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-an-outside-day-in-stock-charts/) that closed near the lows of the range **(2)**. As bad as the day looked, we didn't go negative on the trade that day.

As KKR stock pulled in further the following day, the 50-day line again provided support for the price. We took our first third profit as the bounce continued **(3)**. Our profit locking was quicker than usual in this case. KKR stock doesn't tend to be a big mover. At times, we'll adjust our swing trading profit expectations lower for stocks that move slower.


A Slow And Steady Riser
-----------------------


The next couple of weeks saw a steady rise in the stock. We took another third profit after hitting 7.5% from our entry along the way **(4)**. After eight out of nine days up **(5)**, a pullback wouldn't be unusual. But having locked in gains on the bulk of the position, we also could afford to give it more room. We thought the 10- or 21-day moving average could be a better guide for locking in swing trading profits over the shorter-term 5-day line.


Even the pullback was slow and steady. By the time KKR stock closed below the 10-day line **(6)**, we were already under 50% invested in the swing trading current trades list. As one of our stronger stocks, we gave KKR stock more room.


The drop the next day **(7)**Â found support early in the session as did the market. So we let the bounce on KKR stock play out.


Final Exit On Weakening Market
------------------------------


Our final exit for KKR stock was after a sharp reversal in many growth stocks **(8)**. KKR stock pushed to new highs but closed at the bottom of its range with a much wider spread than usual. The [downside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/great-gains-swing-trading-reversals-dynatrace-stock/) is a swing trading signal that often precedes further weakness and we exited the remaining position.


There hasn't been a major decline since **(9)** but as the market weakness increased our lower exposure was a benefit. It has allowed us to sidestep a lot of destruction in individual stocks.

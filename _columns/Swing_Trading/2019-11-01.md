Looking at the long-term performance of gold, you get a lot of volatility with little excess return. So why would you trade a gold stock? If you're [swing trading,](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) that volatility can work in your favor. But locking in profits when you can is critical.




Not The First Interest In A Gold Stock
--------------------------------------


When trading a gold stock, it doesn't necessarily require a bet on gold itself. The gold miners offer varying levels of business efficiency and opportunity. That means there can be a big difference between the leaders of the group and the laggards, no matter what the price of gold is doing.


For most of 2019, **Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) garnered well-deserved attention with successful trades on both [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) and [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). We've also had previous success in precious metals on SwingTrader with **Anglogold Ashanti** ([AU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AU)) and **Silver Wheaton** ([SLW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLW)). Most recently, Anglogold Ashanti stock got back on our radar.


Swing Trading Example: Anglogold Ashanti Stock
----------------------------------------------


We put Anglogold Ashanti stock on SwingTrader Oct. 23 at 21.54 **(1)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) showed a sharp bounce up and approached recent highs **(2)**. Granted, it was still well off its highs from a couple of months prior, but with swing trading the near-term has more relevance. The gold stock closed slightly down from our entry but still well above our stop loss at the low of the day.


The next day, profitability returned, followed by a gap-up through our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) **(3)**. We took half profits early in the trading session to lock in some profits. As is our custom, we also [raised our stop to 1% profit.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) The raised stop might knock you out of a stock that moves up afterward. It happens. But it's also a key swing trading rule that helps keep trades positive.


Sidestepping A Gap-Down
-----------------------


The gold stock continued up but then quickly started to reverse. A 3.9% gain for the day evaporated and at its low, Anglogold Ashanti stock was down 2.7% from its close the prior day. We weren't in it at that point, however. Our raised stop got us out earlier and we booked a total gain of 3.5% for the trade.


The stock closed higher than our final exit. That can be frustrating and leave you feeling like you got shaken out. That wasn't the case here, though. The next day the stock gapped down and closed with a 6.7% loss **(4)**, well below the five-day moving average and our entry. It's another danger that comes with a volatile gold stock. That's why taking profits quickly is usually your best course of action.

**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) showed one of our favorite [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) setups over the last few weeks. A strong earnings gap that got support and showed an [upside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/may-reversals-gave-multiple-swing-trading-chances/). But we removed it with a loss. What went wrong with Target stock?


Swing Trading Example: Target Stock
-----------------------------------


Target stock didn't really start participating in the coronavirus stock market rally until late July. The problem with stocks that start moving late in a cycle is that their [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) tend to look weak.


But its move was capped by a strong reaction to earnings. On [Target's earnings release](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-q2-2020-target-stock/), the stock gapped up 12.7% for the day **(1)**. Strong digital sales due to consumer behavior shifts during the coronavirus shutdown deserved the credit. A few things normally happen after such a move.


Sometimes, the earnings report acts as a catalyst for a shift in outlook and the gains pile on from there. You may also see investors take the opportunity to sell into the strength and the move is unsustainable. In those cases, the stock quickly falls back to its previous price level.


Ideal action for swing trading is when a stock trades flat or drifts slightly lower after a gap up. That creates a favorable setup.


The Swing Trading Setup That Didn't Work
----------------------------------------


Target stock had the right look Sept. 4 as it showed an upside reversal with support at its [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) **(2)**. It joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day as we looked to increase exposure on what looked like a reversal for the market as it bounced off its 50-day moving average line.


What made Target stock stand out was the nice orderly drift down to its 21-day line, as opposed to the diving action we saw in the market and many top growth stocks. So what went wrong? The market.

The return from the holiday weekend was not kind. Target stock gave up its gains from the reversal and closed back below its 21-day line **(3)**. It exited SwingTrader that day.


Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite has been trading back-and-forth around its 50-day moving average line. Its relatively mild daily price moves we saw in recent weeks started turning much wilder, with a lot of price discovery. The tight stops we use for SwingTrader have a higher probability of getting triggered. But loosening the stops adds more risk to your portfolio at a time when [defensive action is preferred](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategies-cutting-losses/).


You also have to take a step back and resist the temptation to keep trying. It's an easy way to get chopped up buying at highs and selling at lows. In just the last few days, Target stock looked like it would get support at its 21-day line again **(4)**. But then the next day looked weak with no follow up to the reversal **(5)**. It's still one of the better looking stocks out there, but until the market improves the risk of failure remains. A high probability setup is no match for a weak market.

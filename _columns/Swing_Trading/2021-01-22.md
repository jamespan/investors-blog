How many times can you target the same stock for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/)? We may find out with Target stock. It's turned out to be an ideal swing trading stock lately and keeps producing gains.


Swing Trading Example: Target Stock
-----------------------------------


To be clear, it's not that **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) is a guaranteed winner. Target stock has been the topic previously of a [failed trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/why-the-target-stock-swing-trading-setup-failed/). But a failed trade shouldn't discourage trying again should a stock set up properly. Even a success shouldn't disqualify a stock from being on your radar again.


We already had a [successful swing trade in Target stock](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/second-time-was-a-charm-for-target-stock/) on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) when we decided to add it again in November **(1)**. It also was added to our [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) product on the same day.


For SwingTrader, we were taking profits into strength. It left us with just one-third of the position right before the stock topped **(2)**. Our exit on a decisive close below the 5-day moving average line **(3)** saved us from a further drawdown and a couple of weeks of dead money.


But it was not forgotten.


Another Shot Sets Up
--------------------


The pullback in Target stock tightened up to a point where the 5-, 10- and 21-day [moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) all stacked on top of one another. As it popped out of the tight area, we put it on SwingTrader again **(4)**.

Just as before, we took our first third of profits early **(5)** since Target stock doesn't tend to be a big mover. After flat action for a few days, we took our second third of profits as the stock hit 5% profit **(6)**. It wasn't a simple decision. While 5% profit is a good move in short time for Target stock, it was also potentially breaking out above its previous highs **(2)**.


It ended up another 3% for the day from our partial exit. But we still had a good portion that we decided to give some extra room. After its seventh consecutive day up **(7)**, we decided to book the remainder and noted to subscribers the potential resistance at 200.


A Drawdown Avoided
------------------


After a few days of flat action, the decline in Target stock began. If we hadn't sold already, the decisive close below the 5-day moving average would have been a compelling reason **(8)**. Especially with confirmation of our suspicion that 200 would act as resistance.


The next day got even worse as Target plunged through the 10-day moving average line **(9)**. Our earlier sells avoided a drawdown of 7.7%. By contrast, Leaderboard and its longer time horizon has held since November. With a 25% gain, you can handle a stock differently.


With Target stock getting support at its 21-day moving average line and showing a potential reversal, the move might not be done. Which is good for Leaderboard but also means we have another chance on SwingTrader to hit our target again.

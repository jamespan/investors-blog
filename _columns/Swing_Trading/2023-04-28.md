With earnings season in full swing, should you hold [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) into quarterly reports? Here's how we handled a recent trade in DHI stock. The reality is you'll win some and lose some in either case.




DHI Stock Shows A Few False Starts
----------------------------------


No question the homebuilders have been one of the surprise areas of strength in the stock market. When **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) looked like it was going to break a short-term downtrend in March, we added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) a little prematurely **(1)**.


The reversal in DHI stock on the day of our entry was followed by another downside reversal the following day **(2)**. We eventually exited when a March 29 market [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/) saw little participation from DHI Stock **(3)**.


While DHI stock jumped up on volume a couple of days later **(4)**, it immediately pulled back again and undercut its entry-day low over the next few days **(5)**. We didn't trade it that time but it was still on our radar while it hugged its [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


It's not uncommon for stocks to have a few false starts before they really get going.


The Trade That Worked
---------------------


DHI stock recovered from its weakness just a few days later with another strong price move on accompanying volume **(6)**. We decided to give it another go on SwingTrader that day.


Initially it looked like it was up to its old tricks with another pullback over the next three days **(7)**. But even at its lowest point, DHI stock still didn't undercut our entry day, found support at its 10-day line and never closed below its 5-day line.

Those factors allowed us to weather the storm. When DHI stock recovered, we took our first third off to lock in some profit with a 2.5% gain **(8)**. But we were faced with another decision: The quarterly earnings report was due in a couple of days. Was DHI stock worth holding?


Short-term Trading Means Avoiding Big Losses
--------------------------------------------


For swing trading purposes, holding through earnings is generally not worth the risk. Does that mean we miss out on some big gains? Definitely.


DHI stock gapped up for a 5.6% gain on its earnings report and it was even higher earlier in the session **(9)**. A strong move like that can really boost portfolio performance with a decent position size.


Same thing with a recent SwingTrader idea with **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)). Selling that before earnings meant we missed out on a 14% gap up on its earnings report. In that case we had even more cushion going into the trade.



But for all those temptations, remember there is a downside risk too. We also removed **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) from SwingTrader with a nice gain before its earnings report. It fell 15.9%.



The point is, you never know what will happen on an earnings report. A big drop is survivable as a position trader since you will have some outsized gains over time that can counterbalance bad earnings reactions.


But for swing trading you rely on smaller gains building up to a good year. Wiping out months of progress in your portfolio due to a single stock becomes harder to justify.

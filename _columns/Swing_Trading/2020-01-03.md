Sell decisions might not always focus on just the individual stock's action. Rather, the general stock market might dictate the decision. Or you might be making room for other stocks that look stronger. Both factors came into play while [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) Target stock for a small profit.




Swing Trading Example: Target Stock
-----------------------------------


**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) is a strong case against the "retail is dead" argument. After its last two earnings reports, it had huge gaps up and held the gains well each time. As the market had a quick pullback in the beginning of December, Target stock continued to hold its gains well. We put it on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) after it consolidated its gains from its [last earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/target-earnings-q3-2019-target-stock/) and broke a short downtrend **(1)**. It [reversed](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) later that day, closing near its lows, so we kept it on a short leash.


After more than a week's time, we didn't have much progress on it. While the stock market showed strength on Dec. 16, Target stock didn't participate **(2)**. We decided to shift money out of Target stock and move it to other stocks like **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)), **Splunk** ([SPLK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPLK)) and **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) that day. That left us with a small profit at our exit. Had we held until the close, that small profit was gone as it closed below the five-day moving average line **(2)**.


The next day, Target stock snapped right back **(3)**. It passed a prior [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) area around 128 after its gap up, raising the question, "Were we too hasty in our removal?" It's a problem that's easily fixed. We just added it again.

Taking Profits Due To Market Conditions
---------------------------------------


A few days later and we had more than a 1% gain but 130 seemed to be a new area of resistance **(4)**. Progress stalled and after another week **(5)** we weren't up even 1%. That wasn't the case for the stocks that we replaced Target with initially. Splunk, Autodesk and Tempur Sealy stocks were all up 1% to 3%. Since the [stock market indexes looked extended](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/take-profits-swing-trades-extended-market-westlake-chemical-stock/) as well, we decided to take profits where we could. We started with our small gains, like Target stock, and moved onto our larger gainers by the close of Dec. 27 **(5)**.


The stocks we kept were the ones with the most profits, **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), where we had gains of more than 10% from our initial entry.


If the market pulled back a little, we could afford to give up some of our profits on our biggest winners. Our low exposure would prevent us from getting too hurt. Our biggest risk was that the stock market would continue higher and our low exposure would leave us behind.


As it turned out, the market did pull back and all of our removals were lower the next week. Target seemed the best sell decision of all. As the market made big gains at the start of the year, Target stock didn't participate **(6).** Rather than a small gain we would have left with a modest loss. It wasn't the stock action so much as the market that protected our small profit.

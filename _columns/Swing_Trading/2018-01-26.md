When looking at annual returns for the year, it would be a mistake to think they come at a steady rate. More often, the year is punctuated by fits and starts. The job of a [swing trader](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) is to capitalize on the upswings and sidestep the pullbacks.


What's made the last year challenging is that defensive action on pullbacks often saw immediate rebounds to new highs. However, if you didn't take defensive action, you left yourself exposed to sector rotation. That could leave you with the wrong stocks as the indexes were making new highs.


Taking a look at the action of IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) over the last few months illustrates the point. Our current trades shrunk considerably as the Nasdaq composite spent time below its 5-day moving average and dipped below its 10-day line in mid-November. **Skechers** ([SKX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SKX)) was already on as a current trade, but the list expanded more aggressively starting on Nov. 16 **(1)**. **Scientific Games** ([SGMS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGMS)), **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), and **United Rentals** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)) were good for some quick gains before the index started pulling back on Nov. 29 **(2)**. Our defensive selling accelerated on Dec. 1 **(3)**, a morning plagued by headlines that later proved to be false.


On Dec. 7, the buying started again in earnest **(4)**. Getting in early at these [reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/), rather than waiting for new high ground, has been critical to [staying in phase with the market](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/using-the-market-as-your-guide-for-stock-positions/). While some quick profits were booked in names like **RingCentral** ([RNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RNG)) and **Kennameta**l ([KMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KMT)), there were some [small losses](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/small-swing-trade-loss-alibaba-saves-portfolio-money/) as well, like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). But, as the market pulled back starting on Dec. 19 **(5)**, two things occurred that were noteworthy. First, the pullback was very orderly and slow to give up its 10-day moving average. Second, several stocks set up, triggered buys and made progress during this time.


Take **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)). There were many [constructive chart patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) forming among oil explorers and producers as the Nasdaq hit new highs. Diamondback Energy stood out because of its strong earnings record and relative strength. While the market pulled back slightly, it made significant progress.


On Jan. 2 **(6)**, the Nasdaq celebrated the New Year by starting a fantastic run of 8.4% the first few weeks. SwingTrader added names aggressively early on. The backdrop helped boost our confidence. Diamondback Energy was already up 7.8% from its entry by the start of the year. We also booked a few quick profits from stocks like **Weight Watchers** ([WTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTW)) and **Mastec** ([MTZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTZ)) during the pullback. Whenever you start from a position of strength, you have the flexibility to push a little harder. We still employed profit-taking rules to nail down gains along the way up. The reversal on Jan. 16 **(7)**, sparked some loss cutting and profit taking and on Jan 23. **(8)**, another round of selling occurred, as the index seemed extended.


The SwingTrader product has a list of every past trade. What is immediately recognizable is that strings of profits see intrusions of losses periodically in times of market weakness. Keeping that list [overwhelmingly green](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/) requires more names in a favorable market and quick action when it isn't.

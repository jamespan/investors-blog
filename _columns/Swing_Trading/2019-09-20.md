A key component of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) is avoiding holding through periods of no progress. Rather than have money at risk in a stock that doesn't go anywhere, you deploy your cash for the quick small gains. Copart stock provides a recent example.




Swing Trading Example: Copart Stock
-----------------------------------


Salvaged vehicle auctions aren't really associated with technology. But **Copart** ([CPRT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPRT)) innovated by introducing online bidding way back in 1998. Combined with their social media presence, they use technology to support their core business. We often spend more time on the technical side with swing trading, but it's important to realize there is a strong fundamental component to the stocks we choose. Often that fundamental component provides a catalyst for action.


For Copart stock, the catalyst came in the form of a strong earnings report that beat views. It pushed the stock above a previous area of resistance from mid-August **(1).** Copart joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as a half position early in the trading day **(2).**A follow-up alert, after continuing strength, moved it to a full position later in the day. The strong action on earnings also landed the stock as an [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) also hit recent new high territory **(3)** and the [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) was the highest **(4)** since its earnings report the prior quarter. The strong fundamental and technical action combined for the highest possible [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) at 99.


Locking In Profits
------------------


One of the goals of swing trading is to lock in profits in a short period of time. Copart stock cooperated with that goal. After just a couple of days, it was already at our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) **(5)**. We also [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/). That swing trading rule gives a stock room to run while still ensuring that you exit with a decent gain for the overall trade.


Copart stock hit our raised stop the next day and we exited the remaining position **(6)**. Over the next week it consolidated its gains and made no progress. Exactly the type of action we want to avoid. Why have your money at risk when the potential for reward is diminished?


Even as the stock came back it still didn't get much further than our first exit before it got turned away again **(7)**. It doesn't mean the move is over. Having identified a stock with superior fundamental and technical components, it may deserve more room as a position trade. That's why Copart stock remained on our [Leaderboard List](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). We're also keeping it on our radar for swing trading. There's a chance for a continuation of the move, and another chance for profit, after it takes a break.

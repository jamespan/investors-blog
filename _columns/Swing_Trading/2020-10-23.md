Once a trade goes against you, it's tempting to put that stock in the penalty box. But don't forget about it completely. You might have had the right stock at the wrong time. That was the case with [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) Target stock recently.


Swing Trading Example: Target Stock
-----------------------------------


Just over a month ago, Target ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) was the subject of this column as a [failed trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/why-the-target-stock-swing-trading-setup-failed/). An entry on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) before the Labor Day holiday **(1)** didn't move as expected. Though it didn't come down as hard as the market, we exited the next trading day **(2)** and saved ourselves from nearly two weeks of sideways action.


But when the Nasdaq composite put in a bottom on Sept. 21, Target stock was in a stronger position, clearing an area of resistance the next day **(3)**. Action like that made it worth giving another shot. Though it was a failed trade before, we kept watching it and didn't hold the prior failure against it.


Why were we adding before a [follow-through day?](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) For swing trading, we tend to lower exposure quickly when things are unfavorable and we were down to 0% invested when the Nasdaq bottomed. Increasing exposure as the market starts to show signs of recovery helps make sure we don't get left behind.


Target stock offered a lower-volatility trade at a time of uncertainty. That can help keep exposure steady as the risk of getting shaken out is less once you start making progress. But it might take longer to reach your profit goals.


Second Time Is A Charm
----------------------


For Target stock, we started taking profits earlier than usual. On Sept. 28, we still didn't have a follow-through day in any of the market indexes but we had a 2% gain in Target **(4)**. We took a third early since Target stock isn't generally a big mover.


Once we approached 6% profit, we took another third off **(5)**. With just a third left and some decent cushion, you have the luxury of giving a stock more room to run. When Target stock closed below its 5-day moving average the next day **(6)**, we didn't need to act on the weakness. We were already in a position of strength due to the early entry.

That same philosophy held weeks later as Target stock breached its 10-day line for the first time since our entry **(7)**. With just a third position and lots of progress, we were playing with house money. This is another reason why waiting until the close can get you better fills than reacting too quickly at the open.


Though Target stock was making new highs as late as Oct. 20, it started looking tired **(8)**. It couldn't hold its early gains and kept closing in the lower part of its trading range. When it closed below the 10-day line for the first time **(9)**, we exited the remaining position. While our earlier exits lowered our total gain for the trade, we still more than made up for the earlier failed trade in Target stock.

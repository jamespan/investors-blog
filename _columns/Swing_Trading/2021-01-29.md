When you think of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) might not be the first stock to jump to mind. But rotation plays can be great fodder for a short-term run. After getting solid gains in **Freeport-McMorRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)), GM stock proved to be another [big winner outside of the usual high-growth universe.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/fcx-stock-was-early-rotation-swing-trading-play/)




Swing Trading Example: GM Stock
-------------------------------


As we put 2020 behind us, we looked at areas of rotation to start 2021. GM stock was trading tightly with resistance at its Dec. 23 high **(1)**. Its sideways movement allowed its 50-day line to catch up to the price.


We added GM stock to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) after breaking above the resistance **(2)**. For a few days it didn't move much, but we took a third of the position off on Jan. 11 once we got above 2.5% profit **(3)**. General Motors doesn't typically move much so having lower profit expectations made sense.


Not Your Father's Oldsmobile
----------------------------


The next day, GM stock broke above a 46.81 buy point from a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) **(4)**. We had 10% profit at this point and faced a decision. Do we lock in the 10% profit or use our early entry and the breakout as a reason to hold for bigger gains. We compromised. We sold another third and decided to let our final third run.

The gains kept piling on. By Jan. 19, GM stock had a big gap up and nearly a 10% move for the day **(5)**. We had nearly 30% profit from our original entry in just two weeks and decided to take our last third profit in our GM stock. Granted the demand for electric vehicle stocks was a driving force for General Motors. We mentioned that it could be kept as a position trade, but as a swing trade we were happy. Historically, this isn't the kind of move GM stock tends to make.


One could certainly point to the fact that GM stock continued higher the next day **(6)**. But that didn't last.


Another Drawdown Avoided
------------------------


Just two days after our exit, GM stock flashed a bearish signal **(7)**. An [outside day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-an-outside-day-in-stock-charts/) closing near the lows. That usually suggests weakness to follow.


A couple days later, GM stock sliced through its 5-day moving average line **(8)**. Had we waited until this signal, one we often use, we would have had a lower exit price.


Just over a week after our exit, saw more than a 14% drawdown from the peak **(9)**. As GM stock gets support at its [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), it is still holding up as a position trade.


For swing trading, our final exit wasn't at the top, but that isn't our expectation. If we can avoid the big drawdowns while locking in profits into strength, we can keep our portfolio running like a well-oiled machine. Even if it goes electric.

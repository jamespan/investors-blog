[Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) is all about taking quick gains and [keeping losses small](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/keeping-losses-small-is-critical-to-portfolio-progress/). But some of the strongest stocks move so quickly, you might find that the risk percentage gets beyond a swing trading comfort level. So do you skip the trade? Not necessarily. Another alternative is to adjust your position size. A reduced position size allows you to own the strength while mitigating the risk to your portfolio.




Swing Trading Example: Cree Stock
---------------------------------


After January ended on a sour note, we still kept engaged to see if there would be a bounce. The bounce came quicker than expected, on Feb. 1, and we started increasing exposure again.


**Cree** ([CREE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CREE)) was on our radar after its strong support at the [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/). On Feb. 1, it cleared the resistance of the past three days and it joined [SwingTrader](https://get.investors.com/swingtrader/?intcode=start%7Cstart%7Cprdmcst%7C2021%7Cna%7Cst%7Cna%7C%7C397709&src=A011LPH) **(1)**.


Our entry of 109.58 used the first-hour high as a starting point. But using the low of the day at 103.37 as the stop made a risk percentage of 5.7%. That's well beyond our usual 3.5% swing trading target.


Rather than give up on the trade, we simply adjusted our position size down to a half position.


How We Handle Reduced Position Sizes
------------------------------------


You could certainly handle a reduced position size in much the same way. But for our swing trading purposes, here is our general guideline. Since our [full positions are starting at 9% of the portfolio](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-adjustments-temper-swing-trading-risk/) right now, a half position is already below 5%. We still take our first third profit quickly. In the case of Cree stock, it was the next day, after we hit our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-stock-profits-on-the-way-up-to-compound-gains/) **(2)**.

---


That puts the weight in our portfolio down to roughly what our last third of a full position would normally be. We usually let the remainder run. We also raised our stop to a close below our entry after hitting the 5% profit goal.


When Cree stock came back down to its 10-day moving average line **(3)**, it held above the entry and we held the position while it vaulted as high as 18.5% from our entry **(4)**.


Locking In Swing Trading Profits
--------------------------------


While it's great to have gains, you need to lock them in at some point. The short-term moving averages are useful as guidance for swing trading. On Feb. 12, Cree stock closed below its 5-day moving average **(5)** but by less than 1%. We gave it a little more room as it was still one of our strongest stocks.


The next day looked more ominous **(6)**. As we undercut the lows of the last four days, we exited the remaining position. It was decisively below the five-day moving average and ended up closing more than 1% below its 10-day moving average. Add to that a market that looked extended and it seemed like a good place to lock in profits.


The weakness continued the next day **(7)** and the rest of the week. But stocks that pull back should still be watched for new chances. Cree stock provided another swing trading chance on Friday after finding support at its 21-day moving average.

The usual [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) holding period is short. Usually just a couple of weeks. But strong gains can lead to longer holds — if some profits are booked early.




Biotech ETF Offered Quick Profit
--------------------------------


When the market showed a classic reversal off the 21-day moving average in June, there were plenty of swing trading setups that followed. Not just in individual stocks. Exchange traded funds also participated. A favorite used on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) is the **SPDR S&P Biotech ETF** ([XBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XBI)). It captures a move in the biotech sector without the individual stock risk. That can be important given the risks of approvals from the Food & Drug Administration and clinical trials, not to mention the regular earnings reports.


While the Nasdaq composite bounced off its 21-day line, XBI rebounded from its 50-day moving average **(1)** and joined SwingTrader. A couple of days later XBI was already at the [5% profit goal,](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) and we booked a third of the profit **(2)**.


Swing Trading For A Longer Move
-------------------------------


Biotechs didn't let up and a few days later **(3)** we took another third with a 10% gain from our entry. At this point, XBI was up for seven consecutive days and certainly due for a break.


The next day, XBI gapped up but closed near the lows **(4)**. Typically a downside reversal is a good place to exit with a swing trading profit since weakness is expected to follow. We lightened up considerably on SwingTrader that day. But we held XBI because it was still up 1.5% and we already took profits on most of the position. That can allow for the [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) to serve as a line in the sand.

It took nine days for the biotech ETF to get back to its highs **(5)**. The 10-day line successfully contained the move. But that line was lost in a dramatic way the next week with a downside reversal that matched the market **(6)**. That type of action typically triggers swing trading sells. But we held XBI because of the extra profit cushion. We wanted to keep some exposure in case of a rebound, rather than getting rid of everything. And this was one of our stronger positions.


A Different Kind Of Rebound
---------------------------


The Nasdaq saw a strong rebound at its 21-day line the next day and XBI followed suit **(7)**. The biotech ETF powered to new highs but then saw another downside reversal on an outside day **(8)**.


As mentioned in last week's column, [our caution level was up for swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/nasdaq-composite-provides-guidance-for-swing-trading/). Our expectation was for sideways action in a trading range. This time, when XBI closed below its 10-day line, we took the remaining profit **(9)**.


Now that the market has had a few weeks of a breather, it might be time to ramp up swing trading again. XBI notably offered another bounce off its 50-day line Thursday **(10)** and could be a contender again.

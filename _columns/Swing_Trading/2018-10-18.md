Successful [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) is more than just picking winners. Managing position size is critical. A position size calculator can help do this for you automatically or you can do it yourself with some basic math. The idea is that when you are right on a swing trade, you want it to have an impact on your portfolio. When you're wrong, and you will be wrong plenty, you need to minimize your risk as much as possible.




Position-Size Calculator Inputs
-------------------------------


Before choosing the position size for an individual swing trade, you need to ask [how much of your portfolio you are willing to risk?](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sound-position-sizing-opens-door-to-powerful-stock-moves/) That assumes the trade hits your maximum stop loss. For example, a 1% hit to your portfolio might be the most you want to risk on a single trade. For a $100,000 portfolio, multiply by 1% and your maximum dollar risk is $1,000. Keep in mind, that's just for one trade. If you have multiple positions, each position has the potential to make a similar-size dent.


Market conditions might push you to be more conservative. If the market seems more [rangebound and choppy](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-to-navigate-a-sideways-market/) rather than trending, you will usually have fewer trades and may be more tentative in position size. You could cut the portfolio risk in half. Until the market shows more strength, a reduced position size is preferred. We'll use $500 as our portfolio risk for our theoretical $100,000 portfolio.


[IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) includes a position size calculator available by clicking in the lower left corner of any current trade. **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)) was a recent swing trade from earlier this year that went up 10% from our entry in just five days. We would start with the input of $500 as the dollar risk. Next, you need the trade risk. In this case, our entry for American Eagle Outfitters was 20.72 and the stop loss was 20.14, the entry day low.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Position sizing is a personal choice of each investor based on their risk tolerance. Read more about position size considerations in the links at the bottom to determine the right position size for you.*

The position size calculator puts the trade risk at 2.8% (20.14 / 20.72 - 1). You could also enter a set trade risk and it would calculate the stop loss for you. Say you wanted a maximum loss of 3% for the entry price of 20.72. That would be a stop loss of 20.10 or: (1 - 0.03 x 20.72). This is why you learned arithmetic in the first place, right? A [larger trade risk suggests a smaller position size](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/protecting-your-portfolio-with-position-size/) and vice versa.


The Calculation
---------------


With those inputs, the position size calculator will return two values. The position size in this case is just under $18,000, using $500 / 0.028. The calculator also returns the number of shares as 862 by dividing the position size by the entry price.


While the position size calculator will do the math for you, you still need to use some judgment. When entering a swing trade with a tighter stop, a larger position size is possible at the same level of risk to your portfolio. But you might still want to cap your starting position size as a percentage of your portfolio. If you are just starting out, a position that's 20% of your portfolio might be too much until you gain some experience. After all, you still need to sleep at night.


The position size calculator is just one tool on IBD's SwingTrader to help you with your swing trading. [Free trials](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) are available.

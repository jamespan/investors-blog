The stock market correction continues to flail about. How should you handle your [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/)? Fewer stock trades, smaller positions and cut your losses. The goal right now is to prevent a poor market from robbing your portfolio. **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) stock demonstrates the point.




Fewer Trades And A Smaller Position Size In Twilio Stock
--------------------------------------------------------


We've limited our swing trades on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) since going to cash on Oct. 4. A half position test trade in **Centene** ([CNC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CNC)) was [the only attempted swing trade for the rest of October](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-swing-trading/). We tried two trades around the Nov. 7 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). That saw [quick profits in **Ciena**](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/take-profits-quickly-bearish-stock-market/) ([CIEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CIEN)) and [**Staar Surgical**](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-swing-trade/) ([STAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STAA)) and [two stock trades with mixed results](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/herbalife-stock-swing-trading/) around the Nov. 28 follow-through day.


Twilio was the most recent test trade. A larger risk percentage on the trade led to a smaller position size. That strategy helps cut your losses quicker and lose less when you're wrong. Admittedly, Twilio can be a hard stock to handle. While it offers huge upside potential, that doesn't come without additional risk. Look no further than the [last earnings report where Twilio stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twilio-stock-surges-earnings/) surged 35% in a single day **(1),** followed by a 27% correction in the next two weeks.


The correction didn't last long as it was back at new highs in short order, even though the major stock market indexes were still off their highs by more than 10%. It joined SwingTrader as a half position on Dec. 12 as the stock broke out of a short [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) **(2)**. You might argue that the cup with handle wasn't long enough to be proper. But with swing trades the time frames are shorter for how long stocks are held. So we can also [shorten the acceptable base length](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-stock-breakout-strategies-have-familiar-rules/). The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) at new highs, along with the price, was a compelling feature of the chart **(3)**.


Cut Your Losses To Protect Your Capital
---------------------------------------


Why the half position? First, it was a larger risk percentage than our usual target of 3% or less. As mentioned, Twilio stock typically has larger daily swings. Setting a [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) at an undercut of the entry day low put the risk percentage for the trade well above 5%. By using a half position, you cut your loss in half from a triggered stop loss. Reducing the risk to your portfolio is especially critical when the stock market struggles.


As a starting point for position size, determine how much of your portfolio you are willing to risk in a swing trade. More than 1% is aggressive. With the current stock market correction, half of 1% or less is more appropriate. A [sound position size](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sound-position-sizing-opens-door-to-powerful-stock-moves/) balances the risk and reward of your swing trades' effect on your portfolio.

The next day, Twilio triggered its stop loss early in the trading day **(4)**. It seemed like just a shakeout at the time, as the stock bounced back even though the market weakened into the close. But the undercut of the entry day low is an early warning that your original thesis of strength is under fire. Twilio stock lost further ground the next day, spending most of its time below the [5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-average-lines-swing-trading-stock-profits/) as well.


The half position minimizes any hits to your portfolio. At least you cut your losses in half. Of course, that comes with a cost. If you get big gains in a stock, a half position seems woefully inadequate. But there's a reason that our No. 1 rule is to cut your losses. Your gains from stock winners will also be woefully inadequate if you let your losses get away from you and damage your portfolio.

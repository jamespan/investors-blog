The pullback this past week due to China trade war headlines provided a challenge for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). It was enough to easily shake you out if your stops were too tight. Our approach was to clip back some holdings, like Nvidia stock, while giving some of our more profitable positions more room.




China Trade War Fears Knock Markets Again
-----------------------------------------


China trade war headlines can be blamed for a lot of stock market moves this year, both good and bad. This past week was just another episode in the saga when a "phase one" deal looked like it would be delayed. That put into focus an important swing-trading question. How much room do you give a stock when the market sell-off is news-related and potentially temporary?


It's important first to look at your portfolio as a whole. Which stocks have profits and which don't? Where are the logical areas of support and which stocks are more likely to be harder to hold. In our case, the stock market rally already provided a number of stocks that hit their 5% profit goals on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) list: **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), in particular. Of the three, Nvidia stock was the only one we removed.

Swing Trading Example: Nvidia Stock
-----------------------------------


Nvidia stock was on our radar because it joined IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) product from a [bottoming base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investing-after-a-market-deep-freeze-how-to-spot-the-bottoming-base/) in October **(1)**. Its rise was too rocky to use the 5-day moving average line as a sell signal for swing trading but it did hold the 10-day moving average for five weeks until a shakeout after its earnings report **(2)**. It passed that day's high the next trading day and we added it to SwingTrader **(3)**. The snapback was immediate, powerful and cleared an area of resistance just below 212. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) wasn't as high as the shakeout on earnings but was still well above average **(3)**.


[We set our original stop](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-china-trade-war-baozun-stock/) on Nvidia stock at the entry day low. A week later, when we hit our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) **(4)**, we [raised the stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry on SwingTrader. We also locked in profits on half the position.


Holding And Selling Decisions
-----------------------------


When the selling hit the stock market, semiconductor stocks suffered the most. We exited the remaining position in Nvidia stock when it hit its raised stop **(5)**. Semiconductor stocks are notorious for their volatility and China trade war headlines have only magnified the uncertainty. Our exit for Nvidia stock was at 213.94 and it closed at 209.25. Contrast that with our holdings in Disney stock and Alibaba stock. They were both nearer to their highs and didn't trigger our raised stops that day.


The next day things turned uglier. We noted on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&src=A00433A&refcode=pdsoc%7Cggl%7Cibdlive%7C2019%7C11%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C985802&intcode=invstcntnartcls|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|682843) that morning: It isn't how you start the day, it's how you close. Fortunately, we weren't holding Nvidia stock as it punctured our entry and its original stop loss **(6)**. Hesitation would have easily turned our profitable trade into a loss. While we did take some money off the table, we tried to ride the storm on our profitable trades and the stocks with less volatility. Nvidia stock couldn't be saved but we didn't panic and sell everything. As for Nvidia, the support at the 50-day moving average line **(6)** could provide another swing trading buying opportunity.

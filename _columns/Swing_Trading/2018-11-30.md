Stock market corrections vary wildly in length, severity and the damage they can do to your portfolio. That's why [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) strategies generally avoid stock market corrections as much as possible. But the recoveries from stock market corrections hold opportunities for great gains in a short amount of time. So how do you get back in after a stock market correction?




First, it's important to look at what pushed you out. When faced with a steep stock market correction or "vertical violation" of moving averages **(1)**, you need to approach the first rallies with caution. They tend to be failure prone. The severe nature of such stock market corrections usually requires more time to right itself. You might get a quick bounce but a sustained rally is rare.


Large One-Day Gains After Stock Market Corrections
--------------------------------------------------


Large one-day gains in the indexes can give you the feeling that you are missing out. Just remember, the largest gains in the market usually occur during stock market corrections. A 2.9% gain on Oct. 16 put the Nasdaq composite back above its 200-day moving average **(2)**. Though it was enticing, it quickly failed. This is where a test trade can be useful. It's one of the swing trading strategies we use often on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) during market uncertainty. You get to participate a little if the rally continues but don't get hurt too much if the stock market correction takes hold again.


You should also put large gains in the context of the previous day's activity. Oct. 25 saw nearly a 3% gain **(3)**. But viewed in the context of the previous day there wasn't much to be excited about. Even that big of a gain didn't make up for the prior session's 4.4% loss. It was also an inside day. That's where the day's trading didn't surpass the previous day's highs or undercut the lows. Inside trading days don't give much indication of future movement. It isn't until you break one way or the other that you can get some sense of direction.


Follow-through Days Using Swing Trading Strategies
--------------------------------------------------


[Follow-through days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) are a stronger signal than a single one-day gain.  That's where you get a powerful gain on volume heavier than the previous day on day four or later in a rally attempt.  It confirms the initial strength of a one-day gain and suggests the stock market correction may be over. But they don't all work. If you need a reminder, look no further than a couple of weeks ago.


A strong move of 1.8% on Nov. 1 was too early to be a valid follow-through day **(4)**. Volume was also too light. Though it pulled back slightly, the Nasdaq composite didn't undercut its low before posting a 2.6% gain on heavier volume than the previous day **(5)**. It was a classic follow-through day that put the index, once again, back above its 200-day moving average line.


But the gain was short-lived. A steady decline took hold and the index undercut the low of the rally attempt. That officially signals a rally failure and the stock market correction is still in place. Knowing that follow-through days don't always work means you shouldn't get fully invested too fast. We pointed that lesson out in our [swing trading column](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-swing-trading/) at that time.  It's only when you see progress being made in the markets or your portfolio that you gain confidence a rally deserves more money.


Now we are looking at a fresh follow-through day from Nov. 28 **(6)**. Is it the end of the stock market correction this time? It's too soon to tell. Our strategy? We've put a couple of  trades on and they are currently working. But we aren't overly exposed. Further progress and we'll use swing trading strategies to keep looking for new buys. Just as important, locking in profits quickly will protect us if this rally fails as well. If new setups don't present themselves we'll naturally reduce our exposure with swing trading sell rules.

Selling stocks at the top is a worthy goal for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) but easier said than done. Combining the context of the stock market indexes with the price action in individual stocks can inform your selling decisions. That was how a sell in Akamai Technologies ended up within 1% from its recent top.




Your success in a swing trade doesn't just depend on a single decision or metric. It starts with buying right. Then determining your holding rules. Finally, how to maximize your profits or reduce your losses when selling stocks.


Swing Trade Example: Akamai Technologies
----------------------------------------


**Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) formed a classic [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) pattern in March and April. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) after [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) on June 5 at 78.43 with double its average volume **(1)**. The [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) was a little different on this one. Normally, a stop loss at the low of the entry day is appropriate. A drop below that level usually signals the stock may need more time to consolidate. For swing trading, we'd rather take the small loss and move on to a new opportunity. That helps us maximize profits in our shorter time frame.


For Akamai, a stop loss at the entry day low was too tight, less than 1.5%. If you make your stop too tight, a loss is more likely due to a brief shakeout. In this case, we moved the stop loss to the prior day's low for a 3% risk percentage. A proper stop loss is essential for holding a stock.


That extra room came in handy since the stock did challenge the low of the entry day the very next session **(2)**. Two days later, Akamai fell again. This time it fell below the [5-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) and re-challenged the entry day low but reversed strongly **(3)**. A tighter stop loss would mean taking a loss in this trade and missing the subsequent move. It also demonstrates why we wait to see if the stock closes below the 5-day moving average line or gets support before making our sell decision.


Selling Stocks On The Way Up
----------------------------


After two weeks, we hit our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-into-strength-can-maximize-profit-in-swing-trades/) and took full profits at 82.38 **(4)**. Those familiar with our swing trading strategies may note a departure from our normal routine in selling stocks. Usually, we take half profits at the 5% level and see if we can maximize profits toward a 10% profit goal. Two things influenced the decision for the early sell here.


First, the time of the trade. Swing trading looks at a typical trade length of just a couple of weeks. We seek short explosive moves and then take profits on the way up. This often avoids pullbacks that follow. We were already at a trade length of two weeks when we hit the 5% profit goal.


Second, the Nasdaq composite was already extended when Akamai Technologies joined SwingTrader. At the time of the sell, the index was holding up well enough but showed difficulty making progress. Market context is a huge factor in determining whether holding or selling stocks is more appropriate. Akamai did have a couple attempts at progress above 83 but couldn't hold it long. Less than a week after the sell and the stock was down 3% from our exit price.

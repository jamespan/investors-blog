It's not easy to keep emotions contained with market gyrations and there's always plenty of room for self-doubt. Traders can often second-guess themselves fearing their actions may eventually be proven wrong.


But this is where the [swing trader](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) can thrive by having rules. Participating in small moves up and avoiding big moves down allows you to be wrong half the time and still make money.


Take **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)), a recent trade on [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). It started with a strong run up **(1)**  from its 200-day moving average and was added on July 10 at 43.96 as it broke out of a four-day consolidation **(2)**.


We were looking for a 5% profit on Rio and were well on our way after hitting 4% profit on July 17**(3)**but then it looked like it could be running into trouble. For two days, the stock ran into new highs but lost ground by the close.


That weak action continued when the company reported production for the second quarter and lowered its outlook for iron ore **(4)**. That caused a dip in early trading and put the stock below its five-day moving average and on its way to the 10-day moving average line. Our 4% profit dwindled to just 2% and the stock was removed. When we are losing profits and the short-term trend lines get broken, we don't wait around for things to get worse. We take our money and move on to the next trade.


Was there room to play Monday morning quarterback? Sure. After being removed, the stock recovered a lot of the ground lost and actually closed up for the day. But, over the next four days losses continued to mount until eventually the stock showed a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) day **(5)**. If Rio had been held, you could have easily walked away with as much as a 2% loss on the trade.


Flash forward to the more recent action and a [gap up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) put Rio right back at its highs, that is until Thursday's reversal in the market **(6)**. In hindsight, it's easy enough to come up with reasons the stock could have been held. It didn't breach the entry day's low**(2)**and  the weak action following its removal looked like a handle of a larger [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) complete with low volume.


However, to be fair you would also have to recognize that things could have turned even uglier. Rio could have gone down to its 50-day line before finding support or even its 200-day. When you start ignoring swing trading sell rules like breaks of the five- and 10-day moving averages, you set yourself up to take on extra risk and outsize losses. A line in the sand that keeps moving becomes meaningless when motivated by hopes for a better price. No one says you have to give up hope, but rules prevent hope from costing you dearly.

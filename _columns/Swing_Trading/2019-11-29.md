The focus of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) is on short-term gains. That often means you'll sell early and watch from the sidelines as a stock continues higher without you. We recently faced this dilemma with a trade in Lululemon stock.




Swing Trading Example: Lululemon Stock
--------------------------------------


**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) produced a phenomenal run for IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) product in 2018. Since then it's tended to move up, consolidate, then move up again. It might not seem like a screamer in 2019, but the steady gains produced more than an 85% rise this year.


Lululemon stock joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 198.33 with a strong bounce off its 50-day moving average line **(1)**. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) was above average but still lighter than the pullback the prior couple days. [We set our stop](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-china-trade-war-baozun-stock/) on Lululemon stock at the low of the day prior to our entry. That's where it briefly breached the 50-day moving average line. If it undercut that level at 191.21, it would be an indication the stock still needed time to consolidate.


By the time Lululemon stock got to new highs we were already [up 5% from our entry](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) **(2)**. We took half profits at that point and [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry on SwingTrader. At the very least, we wanted Lululemon to hold its gains and not give up much ground. The 1% profit level would give Lululemon room to pull back but keep us profitable.

Selling Into Strength Might Leave Some On The Table
---------------------------------------------------


Lululemon stock kept moving. By Nov. 18, we had our ninth consecutive daily gain **(3).** Our gain was 10% profit from our original entry. So far the stock hadn't given us any reason to worry. It was trending nicely, well contained by its 5-day moving average line. Rather than sell the remaining shares we chose to see if the gains would continue.


A couple of days went by and we exited the remaining position **(4)**. The stock was well-extended above its norm, we had a good profit in a short time, and a lot of other stocks were working well too. Granted, the stock still hadn't closed below its 5-day moving average, but it seemed a little consolidation was likely.


**You Can Always Buy It Back**
------------------------------


It's normal to fear selling when a stock is strong. It's hard to fight the feeling that you'll be missing out if the stock continues without you. But consider that you can always buy a stock back. That was certainly the case for Lululemon stock.


After just three days of sideways movement, Lululemon came down to its 10-day moving average line, found support and bounced strongly **(5)**. It was an outside day where the highs and lows engulfed the trading range of the previous day. With a close near the peak of the day, there was a lot that looked good. Assuming you bought Lululemon stock back at the highest price for the day, you sacrificed less than 2% vs. holding. It's not always easy to do, but buying things back is a profitable tool in swing trading success.

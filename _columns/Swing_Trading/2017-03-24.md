One of the qualities that makes a great trader is knowing how to adjust to different market environments. Having a sense of how much the market is willing to give you leads to tweaks in what rules to apply.


The market environment in the past year has been one of tighter rules for [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH): taking half profits at 5%, selling at decisive closes below the 5-day, and has included many periods of limited trading or at least limited position sizes.


But that isn't always the case. At the end of 2014, the Nasdaq composite started trending above its short-term 10-day moving average line after a 10.7% correction that bottomed in October. Corrections over 5% help set the stage for more [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) opportunities, which is why they should be welcomed and not feared. After trending above 10-day for a few weeks, a shift in expectations for profits would be justified and rules should be modified accordingly.


Take **AMN Healthcare** ([AMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMN)) made a move that started with a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) **(1)** on Nov. 18 amidst this trend in the Nasdaq.  The stock had just bounced from a brief spell below its 50-day moving average, its first breach in over four months, and volume came in heavier than average on the reversal. A purchase could have been made near the closing price of 16.26.


Within three days **(2)** the stock was already up 5% and, as usual, the stop would be raised to the 1% profit level. But rather than taking partial profits at 5%, the stronger market would allow you to give it more room, holding the stock for a bigger gain and also using a decisive close below the 10-day moving average line instead of the 5-day. That allowed you to stay the course when the 5-day line was breached **(3)** and led to a 10% profit goal getting accomplished on Dec. 5 **(4)**.


Over the next seven days, AMN reached as high as 15% profit before falling back near the 10% profit level. This would have put you at a crossroads. The stock closed below the 10-day moving average but still within 1% while volume came in lower **(5)** so could be held. Taking of partial profits would also be understandable.


From there, the stock hit the 20% profit level in the next three days **(6)**, an excellent opportunity to lock in a good gain in just over a month's time. If the stock was held beyond that, still using a decisive close below the 10-day for protection, the sell would have come on Jan. 2 still leaving you with an 18% gain from the purchase price **(7)**.


The current market environment could be setting up for a correction of at least 5% to 10%. If that's the case, just remember what ample opportunities could lie on the other side.

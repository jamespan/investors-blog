The last couple of weeks haven't been the ideal environment for a swing-trading style. When the market is uncooperative and going sideways, even if your stocks don't breakdown, the lack of progress makes it hardly worth the effort and risk of putting on trades.


The lack of trading brings up a unique risk: lower engagement with the market. Nothing keeps you as engaged as when you have actual dollars on the line. Losing focus because of less engagement can put you behind when the market eventually does turn. And being late to a tradable rally can hold steep opportunity costs. That's where keeping a watch list with fresh names can help.


For **[IBD SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH)**, the current sideways market has been a challenge. Reducing the Current Trades list to actionable stocks has resulted in a small list with few new names entering. Sharing a full watch list could be overwhelming for those with limited time to sift through numerous names. New features were launched this week that allow the Current Trades list to include a limited number of select watch-list names.


These names will be distinguished from Current Trades in two ways. In the Current Trades list, the gain/loss will show up as Not Triggered, reflecting that the stock hasn't qualified as a Current Trade yet. Also, there won't be an IBD Buy Zone listed for the trade while it is a watch-list stock. Potential buy points and volume thresholds will be noted in the Trade Setup text.


While the stock is on the watch list these elements might change. Sometimes a different buy point will be used based on intraday chart action, or a lower volume threshold could be used based on recent activity. A watch-list stock needs that flexibility because when putting on an actual trade, it's not just about crossing a buy point, it's *how* the stock crosses the buy point.


**Southwestern Energy** ([SWN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWN)) is currently on the watch list as oil tries to break its recent downtrend. That makes oil-related companies a natural place to look for opportunities. Southwestern has been trading tightly as crude prices vacillate. Potential areas of resistance — which would turn into buy points if breached — are shaping up.


A more traditional buy point would be at 14.82, a one-month high. However, if the stock continues to consolidate, or if volume spikes above recent levels, an earlier buy point could materialize near 14.20. Names on the watch list give you more time for your own due diligence and allow for a quick decision should the stock make a move.


Current Trades and now Watch List names are available to subscribers and trialists on the **[Current Trades](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/)** tab of SwingTrader. **[Free trials](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH)** are available.

Stocks in the biotech sector can pose a problem for a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). Since we take profits quicker in swing trading, we need to avoid big losses. Biotech stocks have many ways where a gap down in price could be just around the corner. One solution is to swing trade the biotech sector with an exchange-traded fund (ETF).




What makes biotech stocks particularly tricky is how many events can lead to huge fluctuations in valuations. Clinical trials, approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, and news on competitors can all make for a wild ride in individual biotech stocks. It multiplies the binary events, like earnings reports, where investors heartily reward the news or punish the stock severely. An exchange-traded fund, such as the **ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology** ([BIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIB)) ETF offers a solution. It can give you exposure to moves in the biotech sector with assets spread out among individual stocks. If one stock has negative results from a clinical trial, it's just one of many stocks. It reduces the risk of one swing trade tanking your portfolio. The 2X-leverage on the ETF makes the moves larger and more in line with what an individual growth name would provide.


Swing Trade Example: A Quick Profit From A Sector Move
------------------------------------------------------


On Sept. 20, the Nasdaq composite showed signs of a recovery from a recent drop to its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). Scanning screens specifically for a swing trade revealed a number of stocks setting up in the biotech sector. Many of them were [reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) from their 50-day lines. Rather than trying to pick one, we put BIB on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) to give us exposure to the biotech sector but spread our risk from one stock to many **(1)**. Our profit goals remained at our normal 5% and 10%, something the double leverage was more than capable of delivering.


Along the way, BIB had a number of days that started strong but closed weak and low in the trading range. But our swing trade in the biotech sector ETF still made progress. In under a week, our swing trade closed in on the 5% price target just above 70. But this also coincided with an area of resistance. In August and January, the biotech sector ETF dropped quickly after hitting the area around 70. If it powered through, it could be the start of a big move for the swing trade. But we were already seeing tentative action.


Swing Trade Triggered Multiple Sell Signals
-------------------------------------------


On Sept. 27, the ETF kept closing in on the 5% profit goal but couldn't quite get there **(2)**. Rather than quibble over pennies, we took profits on the entire swing trade. The Nasdaq composite showed a number of bearish reversals along the way, the area of resistance was formidable and nearly 5% in a week's time is by any measure a good swing trade. It's good to have [price-target flexibility](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/price-target-flexibility-when-to-sell-stocks/) based on market conditions.


If we weren't already out, a number of sell signals triggered that would still allow us to leave the swing trade with a profit, albeit a smaller one. Once BIB did finally break above the [area of resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) and hit its 5% profit goal, it didn't hold it for long before a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(3).** A momentum change like that in a swing trade could prompt a sell. The next day saw a decisive [close below the 5-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/), outlined as a sell signal in the trade setup on SwingTrader. Finally, [a raised stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/) would be in effect after the 5% price target. That sell signal triggered the next day **(4)**. By that time, [sell rules had pushed us out](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-bearish-market-outlook/) of all our swing trades.

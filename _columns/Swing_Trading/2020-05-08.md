Different markets require different [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) strategies. With Domino's stock a month ago, we played a breakout. A couple weeks ago we played a reversal. Both trades were profitable, illustrating the importance of having multiple tools at your disposal.




Soaring Relative Strength Lines Deserve Attention
-------------------------------------------------


**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) provides a good example of making adjustments with swing trading. We secured profits well on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) [near the market top](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-fears-spark-another-weekend-retreat/) in February and [we didn't get hurt through the market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-swing-trading-performance/). But once we saw a follow-through day on the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500, it was time to increase exposure again.


Domino's stock was a good candidate. It's an [IBD Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) that benefited from shelter-in-place orders. The soaring [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) amid the coronavirus stock market crash really stuck out. Domino's stock showed promise with investors as customers flocked to takeout and delivery over dine-in options for their restaurant choices.


Domino's Stock Shows A Breakout
-------------------------------


On April 13, Domino's stock flashed a breakout and we put it on SwingTrader **(1)** as a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/). Given the steep decline and the uncertainty that remained ahead, we wanted to be cautious as we ramped up exposure. When the stock market is trending, we tend to go in heavier.


A week later and we were already at our 5% profit level **(2)**. This is often a place where we would take half profits and we followed that same protocol even though we only had a half position. The next day saw a downside reversal **(3)**.


That's usually a signal of weakness to come, at least on a short-term basis. Even worse, it was on an outside day where the price action surpassed the high and undercut the low of the previous day. Plus, earnings were due in a few days and we weren't holding through the quarterly report. Our average exit gave us a 3.6% gain for the trade with the half position reducing the effect. [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), by contrast, also had a position with a lot of cushion. As a position trade, rather than a swing trade, the decision was to hold through earnings.

The next day broke our expectations for weakness **(4)**. Domino's surprised us with a 5% gain right before earnings. It's OK to be wrong on the action if you are taking it for the right reasons. Sometimes you are playing the odds and the low-odds play wins.


There's The Short-Term Weakness
-------------------------------


Over the next five days, Domino's stock fell all the way back below our entry and undercut 350 **(5)**. We were right on the weakness to come, just a day early. But as Domino's stock undercut 350, it came back strongly that day. This is a classic upside reversal pattern and we put it back on SwingTrader. This time, however, Domino's stock was a full position.


Why? First, reversals played properly tend to give you more runway for gains with less risk. Second, the market was also showing signs of a reversal pattern. With the market behind your back, the likelihood of success is even better. Finally, by that point, the trend in the stock market was more established.


Taking Profits Differently In Domino's Stock
--------------------------------------------


The reversal didn't go up right away, but it also didn't undercut our stop. Finally, on May 5, Domino's stock started to move **(6)**. We quickly got our 5% profit level the next day **(7)** but this time we didn't take half profits like usual. Instead, we booked a third. With the market in such a favorable condition we wanted to give some of our winners more room to run. We would still have some profits booked but the bulk still working for us.


However, the end of the day gave us some pause. It was another downside reversal. Not an outside day this time, but still a sign of potential weakness. The stock market faded into the close, so this was common to see in a lot of stocks. However, the next day **(8)** the stock market powered higher and Domino's stock didn't participate. That spurred the decision to remove the remaining position.


Another consideration is that we had heavy exposure at that point with a lot of stocks on our Current Trades list. It was time to pare back the weaker ones and Domino's stock didn't make the cut. Still, the 3.5% gain for the trade in under two weeks wasn't bad for what is typically a slower-moving stock. And this time, the full position made the impact greater.

**Abiomed** ([ABMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABMD)) stock provides a good example of handling profits in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). A stock market rally starts, you book quick profits then avoid sideways action. Do that often enough, while keeping losses small, and you can have a phenomenal year of gains.




Swing Trade Example: Abiomed Stock
----------------------------------


A critical component of Abiomed's success was a powerful stock market rally behind it. Abiomed stock joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on Feb. 14. That same day, the stock market confirmed its rally attempt with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) **(1)**. Whereas the market sliced through its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), Abiomed's consolidation held well above that moving average line. When the market turns, these higher relative strength stocks often show the most powerful moves. Abiomed also posted strong volume **(1)** at its 244.61 entry when it cleared an area of [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) from six days prior. By the day's close, we were already up 4.4% on our swing trade.


The following day, we booked half profits as Abiomed stock passed its 5% profit goal **(2)**. Swing trading strategy relies on [taking some money off the table](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-profits-knowing-when-to-say-when/) with explosive gains. Keeping a partial position allows you to participate if the stock goes up more. But, if the stock pulls back as quickly as it rose, you will have a better average exit price with an early sell.

In this case, Abiomed continued upward. We sold the remaining shares as the stock approached its 10% profit goal **(3)**. Two main factors guided the decision. The stock hit resistance intraday and was on a 22% tear in just six days. That usually requires a break. Over the next week or so, the stock went sideways.


It wasn't the end of the story for Abiomed. The stock staged another powerful gain **(4)** with another stock market rally underway on March 2. We passed on this swing trade in favor of another, dating product provider **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)). A deciding element was [better volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) for Match. Both stocks shot up the next seven days but when Abiomed topped **(5)** on March 12, Match ran a couple of extra days. Volume often acts as fuel for stock moves. The more you have at the start, the longer your move can last.


Is The Current Stock Market Rally For  Real?
--------------------------------------------


The stock market rally that started Feb. 14 did show some contrasts to our latest follow-through day on April 10. First, the fall that preceded it was steeper. That can often lead to an equal reaction the opposite way — a bullish bounce. The most recent fall transpired slower and also spent some time with buyers and sellers trading blows. Headlines seemed to pull sentiment violently one way or the other. By the time the follow-through happened April 10, the major market indexes had failed repeatedly to break recent resistance.



The quality of setups also shifted. Rather than high relative strength stocks with accompanying volume, the stronger stocks haven't had volume and the weaker, beaten-down stocks seem to be getting more of the action. A change in that trend and further gains in the overall market could provide more swing trading opportunities.

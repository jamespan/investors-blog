Selling stocks into strength is a key part of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). Unfortunately, that comes with the danger of selling too soon and watching a stock continue without you. That was the case with a recent swing trade in Chipotle stock. But having a stock roll ahead without you doesn't necessarily mean it was a bad decision to sell.




Swing Trade Example: Chipotle Stock
-----------------------------------


**Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) started on the [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) watch list Feb. 22 **(1)**. It had flat action from its [breakaway-earnings gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) and we looked at the previous high of 612.60 as a possible area to trigger. Chipotle stock price reached that level on March 1, but it didn't have spectacular [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) behind the move **(2)**. As a result, we sent an alert to subscribers. We relayed that CMG stock would stay on the [watch list](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/consider-watch-lists-homework-that-pays-off/) without triggering. Then we moved up the buy point by about ten points as it continued to consolidate.


On March 12, Chipotle stock price jumped into our buy zone and this time volume was strong **(3)**. Because the price of CMG stock remained tight, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) also hit new high ground **(3)**. In just over a week, Chipotle stock hit the [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-profits-knowing-when-to-say-when/) **(4)**.


Normally, the 5% profit goal is where we take half profits and look to a 10% profit goal for the remaining shares. We veered from our normal path this time. It was the seventh day of gains in Chipotle stock price out of the last eight. Plus, the general stock market indexes started to look extended as well. We took full profits on the CMG stock position at just over 5% **(4)**.


Chipotle Stock Price Continues Rising
-------------------------------------


Chipotle stock price made little progress over the next four days as the stock market also pulled back. That included a sharp move below [the 5-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) with immediate support at the 10-day moving average **(5)**. We also noticed during this time, a lot more swing trading setups started to fail. **Paycom** ([PAYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAYC)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) both didn't work and ate into the profits from our previous five trades. Due to the stock market weakness we moved our market action to [sideways trend](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/this-old-adage-rings-true-for-sideways-markets/). It seemed to justify our selling decision on Chipotle stock.


But it kept going. It reached our 10% profit goal without us **(6)**, despite the stock market weakness. So far, it still doesn't show signs of stopping. The seven of eight days up is now extended to 13 of 15 days without a single close below the 5-day moving average since our entry. Chipotle stock price just crossed the 700 mark this past week. It remains on the [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/) product as a position trade with more than a 20% gain.


But does that mean the sell decision was a mistake? Not necessarily. For every stock that bucks the market trend, three of them will follow it. While the recent pullback has been mild, we would have lost a lot more profits in most cases by trying to hold through it.

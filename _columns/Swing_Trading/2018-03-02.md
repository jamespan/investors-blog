The stock market is one of the most important factors for a [swing trade's](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) success. Getting the direction right is critical, but not always easy. Analyzing market behavior day by day is preferable to guessing, but some measure of expectation going into a trade helps proper positioning. This is where historical precedents play a part. A little compare and contrast analysis starts building a model of what the future may hold. But if reality deviates from your model, reality always wins.


[Last week's column](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) mentioned a few times similar to the current market. One of them was the sell-off in early 2016, the most recent correction with some time and depth.




 After getting support at its 50- and 200-day moving averages **(1)**, the Nasdaq composite went above those lines for a short time before slicing through them again. First, it dropped below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) on a 1% loss **(2)**. Things worsened the next day on more than a 2% gap down below the 200-day line **(3)**. This vertical violation of the moving averages was similar to the Nasdaq action at the beginning of February this year.


When suffering days of losses, you eventually have a bounce at some point. It's important to not plow back into the market too quickly as one day of buying could just be temporary. That was the case twice in 2016 as two reversal attempts rapidly failed **(4)**.


The follow-through day is a more proven sign of a turn, but even those don't always work. Especially with a vertical violation and correction, the first one or two tries have higher failure rates. In 2016, a follow-through day on Jan. 26 **(5)** saw the Nasdaq composite up 1.1%, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials each came in above 1.4%, and the Russell 2000 more than 2%. Despite the breadth of strength, two weeks later markets hit new lows.

Just because one signal doesn't work, doesn't mean to ignore the next. On Feb. 17 another follow-through day triggered **(6)** starting a strong uptrend that held above its 50-day moving average throughout most of the next two years.


The correction, with a little more time, produced a flurry of new growth prospects including **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) that joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on Mar. 11 **(7)** on its way to a phenomenal move.


How does this inform the current market? The action last week put a dent in the follow-through day we saw on Feb. 14. However, supporting action on Friday improved the outlook, keeping the Nasdaq composite above its 50-day moving average line and the rally intact. More importantly, it gave individual stocks more time to form [sound patterns](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/). It's early to say whether this [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) holds but the extra time does put it more in line with past precedents.

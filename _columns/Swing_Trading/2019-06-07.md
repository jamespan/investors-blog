We officially hit intermediate correction status with a 10% stock market correction this past week. After a strong week, where do we go from here?




How We Handled The Stock Market Correction So Far
-------------------------------------------------


First, let's review where we've been. May was not a particularly busy month for IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). A main part of our [swing trading strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) is to avoid the carnage whenever possible. That was our approach with this latest stock market correction.


After booking profits in a number of stocks, more setups started failing. It made us cautious and we put stocks on our watch list but they weren't getting triggered as current trades. As a result, by May 1 we went to cash **(1)**. As setups continued to falter, or not show enough strength to trigger, we changed our market action to sideways a week later **(2)**.


We tried a [test trade with a half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-position-test-trades-stock-market-correction/) in **ServiceNow** ([NOW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NOW)) as the Nasdaq composite got support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). But when it sliced through that level **(3)**, we quickly cut our losses short. The nature of the moving average breach looked more like what we call a ["vertical violation."](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-bearish-market-outlook/) That's the type of action that preceded recent stock market corrections in February and October 2018 and January 2016 along with a host of historical examples. We switched our market action to downtrend to reflect our negative view.


The Nasdaq composite immediately rallied back above its 50-day line **(4)**, but we were still cautious. We tried a couple of test trades with **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Paylocity** ([PCTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCTY)) but took our profits quickly when the market faded again **(5)**. While you can get some V-shaped recoveries, most don't work after the vertical violation. A warning of the chance that [the stock market correction could get worse](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/were-not-out-of-the-woods-yet-for-potential-bear-market/) was the focus of a previous column.


Another challenging aspect of this market is how much of the movement was news-related. When tweets on trade-talk progress dictate valuations, the results can be mercurial indeed. That can also discourage shorting since a news item could just as quickly launch a powerful move that could devastate a short position.


How We'll Approach A Follow-through Day With Swing Trading
----------------------------------------------------------


A couple more test-trade attempts failed and the result left us in cash as the Nasdaq composite breached its longer-term 200-day moving average line **(6)**. The next day, the index officially hit the 10% correction level and our sitting continued **(7)**. Then, we had three days of strong price action **(8)** and a big gain to end the week. So is the stock market correction over?


On the downside, the volume was weak on the way back up. Plus, it's still a news-driven market. The resolution of tariffs against Mexico looks promising. However, it could fall apart quickly, or go backward as we saw with China.


A poor jobs report showed weakness for the economy but increased the possibility of rate cuts from the Fed. At this point, the indexes haven't put much time into this stock market correction and that can increase [the failure rate of the first follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/not-every-market-follow-through-works-2-red-flags-to-watch-for/). As a reminder, a follow-through day on [Nov. 7 and Nov. 28 both failed](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-corrections-swing-trading-strategies/) as the market needed more time.


But it's often better to put a little money to work early than wait too long for certainty the stock market correction is over. Plus, many of the leaders didn't see the damage you would normally see at this point in a correction. A look at the weekly charts on many Sector Leaders shows tight closes.


So what to do? This is where swing trading can help. You have a smaller profit goal, shorter time horizon and low tolerance for losses. Rather than waiting for a rally failure with an undercut of the Nasdaq's low **(7)**, we would scale back earlier. Because we've suffered minimal damage in the stock market correction, we can afford a little extra caution to make sure the rally can last.

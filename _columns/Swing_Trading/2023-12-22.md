Last week's column covered a [successful trade in gold stocks](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/gold-stocks-gave-us-an-early-christmas-gift/). This week, we'll focus on bank stocks. Bank stocks are another area that might have gotten lost in the shuffle with all the focus on artificial intelligence. But as good as the action was for swing trading, at a certain point it was almost too good.




An Out Of Favor Industry
------------------------


When the market bottomed in October **(1)**, bank stocks were still roughly at the same level as March. Remember that was shortly after the [failure of Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.investors.com/news/silicon-valley-bank-liquidity-crisis-sends-shockwaves-through-financial-industry/) sent a ripple effect through regional banks and even some larger names. Since that meltdown, the SPDR S&P Bank Stocks ETF ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) found itself solidly below its 200-day line for months.


After the follow-through day, bank stocks seemed to gather momentum. KBE found itself back above its 50-day line and nearly ready to tackle its 200-day line **(2)**. After one final pullback, KBE launched above its 200-day line **(3)** and more importantly stayed there. It was that flat action by the bank stocks ETF that intrigued us as a potential swing trading position


Bank Stocks Ramp Up
-------------------


When KBE popped back above 40 after holding tight above its 200-day line, we added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(4)**. Its relative strength line was also getting into shape. As the market started anticipating a more dovish Fed, bank stocks started to ramp up gains. Even though we had our position in an ETF, the gains started coming quickly and didn't disappoint.


We took our first third of the position off with a gain of 2.5% and the ETF kept moving strongly the rest of the day **(5)**. So much so that we were already at 5% profit the next day **(6)**.

After a brief pause, the gains started quickly piling up. When the Fed meeting came around and multiple interest rate cuts looked to be on the horizon, bank stocks cheered the news **(7)**. Although we had a reduced position at that point, it was still nice to participate in a 5% gain that day with the relative strength continuing to power higher.


Selling Into Strength
---------------------


However, we felt the need to temper our enthusiasm. At a certain point, were the gains getting too good? The next day saw a gap up and a 4% gain by the close **(8)**. We exited the remaining position. Not because the bank stocks were doing anything wrong. It just seemed wildly extended — compared to the historical moves — and unsustainable.


We weren't trying to catch the top but our decision ended up being pretty close. KBE closed the gap up on the day we sold, but it hasn't broken down. This might be a case where a breather might give us another chance at capturing even more gains from a former winner.

While [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) usually focuses on small gains, sometimes the gains can come quicker than expected. Especially in the world of biotechnology. Here's how we handled a recent trade in Crispr Therapeutics stock to maximize profit.




Swing Trading Example: Crispr Therapeutics Stock
------------------------------------------------


Gene editing is moving from science fiction to medical reality. **Crispr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)) is at the forefront of this biotech revolution. It looked ripe for a swing trade earlier this month. On Nov. 12, Crsp stock pushed past prior resistance at 52.28 on an upgrade by Oppenheimer **(1)**. The relative strength line vaulted to new high territory as well **(2)** and it was in good company. Other stocks in the medical sector showed a lot of strength.


We added Crispr Therapeutics stock to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 53.64 early in the trading session. By the end of the day we saw a huge spike in trading volume, **(3)** confirming the buying demand.


The stock flattened out the next couple of days. But it remained inside the large spread of our entry day **(1)**. In other words, even after a 5% move on the upgrade, Crsp stock refused to give up ground.


Taking Profits By Selling Into Strength
---------------------------------------


After the brief pause, Crispr Therapeutics stock made another strong move. It hit [our 5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) **(4)** and we took half profits. As usual we [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/). That way if the surge was short-lived and reversed, we could still walk away with a profit. That can trigger a little easier with a biotech company because they tend to have higher volatility, but we still find the rule useful.


The next day, the stock approached our 10% profit goal but we held out as it continued to move up. On Nov. 19, Crispr Therapeutics and **Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX))[released promising data on trials using the CRISPR/CAS9 technology.](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crispr-gene-editing-drug-shows-early-promise-human-studies/) Though it was just two patients, the potential is huge. Crispr Therapeutics stock rocketed 5% at the open and kept rising from there **(5)**.


**Don't Get Greedy!**
---------------------


We sent an alert to subscribers at the open that we would give the stock more room to run. A couple hours later, we decided to book the remaining profits as we were up more than 22% from our entry in just a week's time. We didn't sell at the top, but we still walked away with a sizable gain.


The next day wasn't particularly alarming as the profits deteriorated somewhat **(6)**. An announced [stock offering by Crispr Therapeutics](http://ir.crisprtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crispr-therapeutics-announces-proposed-public-offering-common-1) weighed on the stock, and profits continued to evaporate further the following day **(7)**.


Traders aren't the only ones looking to cash out on big gains. The offering would infuse extra cash into the company. That can be useful for the long-term prospects to expand the research and bring the technology to market. For swing trading, our early exit maximized our profit and avoided the larger drawdown.

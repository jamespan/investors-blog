Earnings season always comes with your highfliers that you wish you had. If you try to buy them before earnings, you risk a disappointing report that tanks the stock. If you wait until after earnings are out, you might miss the huge surge from an earnings surprise. [Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) after a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/breakaway-gap-the-art-of-the-breakout/) on earnings can help you manage your risk but still participate in a quick profit. Twitter stock provides a recent example.




Twitter Stock Jumps On Earnings Breakaway Gap
---------------------------------------------


The best setups start before the earnings report itself. For **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)), a nine-day winning streak put it back above its 200-day moving average **(1)**. We prefer stocks showing strength as opposed to weakness. As the stock pulled back, the action remained tight, falling only 4.4% at its worst **(2)**. When the company reported earnings before the open on April 23, the reaction was immediately positive. [Twitter soundly beat expectations for earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/twitter-earnings-q1-2019-twitter-stock/), and investors had to quickly adjust their valuation of the company given the new data.


Twitter stock jumped 7.4% at the open, and after a few minutes of trading we added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 37.84 as the strength continued **(3)**. Though Twitter was still in a long consolidation, the breakaway gap from the recent tight area provided a powerful setup. Additionally, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) surpassed a recent high and [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-speaks-volumes-for-trades/) was on track to be the highest in the past nine months **(3)**. We set our stop-loss at the low of the entry day to protect our capital. An undercut of that level could just be a shakeout but it could also be a reassessment that just gets worse.


Locking In A Quick Swing Trading Profit
---------------------------------------


In this case, the strong momentum continued to build. After just an hour of trading, Twitter stock hit our 5% profit goal from our entry point **(4)**. As is our custom, we took half profits on the trade and [raised the stop to a 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry. You'll see plenty of examples where the stock continues up. You might second-guess the action and wonder: Why take an early 5% gain when I can stretch it even further? But be careful of greed. If stocks extend their gains too quickly, they can fall all too easily. That's why the stop-loss is in place to protect you in case the trend shifts quickly. But booking the early gain also focuses on keeping the trade profitable. You've locked in some profits but still have a meaningful position to participate on the upside if the gains continue.


In this case, Twitter stock continued a little higher and then pulled back. A couple days later, it hit our raised stop and we removed the remaining shares **(5)**. It put the average exit price at a 3% gain for the trade. For a three-day trade it's a decent profit in a short period that lets you move on to the next opportunity. That's what swing trading is all about.


Leaderboard Uses A Different Strategy
-------------------------------------


Our [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) product is handling the Twitter stock position differently. It continues to hold Twitter, even though the stock is below Leaderboard's higher entry. Why? The time frame is different. Huge gains often need time to consolidate before continuing to push higher. The pause after the big jump is constructive. **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) provides a recent example of the pause [providing another buying opportunity](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/chipotle-stock-price-selling-stocks/).


But since a swing trade only lasts a couple weeks, the time the pause takes is better spent with your money in something else or not at risk during sideways action. When your time frame is measured in months, like it is with Leaderboard, you look at the constructive action and can wait to see if it pays off.

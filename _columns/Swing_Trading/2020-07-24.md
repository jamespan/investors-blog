While [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) tends to be more active than traditional trading, you also need to recognize the times where the odds are not in your favor. The Nasdaq composite, along with your individual stocks, act as cues to know when to be aggressive or defensive.




Swing Trading Strategy: Upside Reversals Create Opportunities
-------------------------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite recovered strongly after the coronavirus stock market crash. But it wasn't a straight line back to the top. Small pullbacks occurred along the way with support often coming at the [21-day exponential moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) **(1)**. Sometimes the pullbacks in the Nasdaq composite were violent, like the June 11 drop of 5.3% **(2)**. But the [upside reversals at the line offered fresh swing trading entries](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/great-gains-swing-trading-reversals-dynatrace-stock/). In that light, the pullbacks were welcome.


It happened again at the end of June **(3)**. The Nasdaq composite pulled back. Then a reversal day undercut the lows of the previous day and it closed high in the trading range. On [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), we went from lightening up to getting on margin. A few days later and the Nasdaq composite gapped up **(4),** rewarding the early aggressiveness.

Downside Reversal In Nasdaq Composite Provided Warning
------------------------------------------------------


On the flip side, you also need to be aware of [downside reversals](https://www.investors.com/videos/tales-of-the-trade-bearish-reversals/). These suggest further weakness and mark a good place to go defensive in your swing trading. July 7 provides a classic example **(5)**.


A move into higher ground for the Nasdaq composite was followed by a close near the low of its trading range. This was also an outside day as the low was lower and the high was higher than the previous day. In this case, the close near the lows suggested weakness to follow, at least in the near term.


It doesn't always happen that way. The Nasdaq composite has been remarkable in its resilience, making any weakness short-lived. That's how July started playing out as the Nasdaq composite shrugged off the downside reversal and continued higher.


As the Nasdaq composite pushed into new high ground, it also was extended far above its norm. That's where selling into strength with swing trading can naturally lighten up your exposure. It helped on July 13 when a more dramatic downside reversal hit the Nasdaq composite **(6)**.


Less Is More
------------


With the Nasdaq composite showing an upside reversal the next day **(7)**, we tempered our swing trading due to the increased volatility. It can be real easy to get shaken out of individual stocks, so we focused on exchange traded funds.


We expected sideways movement but knew we could be wrong. The ETFs would make it so we still participated if the market skyrocketed higher, just maybe not as much as from individual stock trades. Should the market falter, we might see some downside. But again, not as much.


The strong move on July 20 was a positive expectation breaker **(8)**. While normally this would instill aggressive buying, we actually did more selling into strength. The problem? It put the Nasdaq composite right back into extended territory. We continued just moderate swing trading this past week, with more selling than buying. That lowered the hit on the July 21 downside reversal **(9)** and that left us light when Monday's gains were erased on Thursday **(10)**.


Going into the weekend, we saw a nice upside reversal to end the week **(11)**. But it still left the Nasdaq composite below its 21-day line for only the second time since April 6. Our swing trading strategy? Again, we shifted toward ETFs. It gives us some exposure for participation. Should the Nasdaq composite follow through on Friday's reversal, we've kept our powder dry for more aggressive buying if necessary.

As the nation gets vaccinated, more attention is turning to what the reopened economy looks like. Live Nation stock certainly looks to benefit but our [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) attempt didn't unfold as expected. But we still kept the trade profitable.




Swing Trading Example: Live Nation Stock
----------------------------------------


**Live Nation Entertainment** ([LYV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LYV)) certainly took its beating in the coronavirus crash to the tune of a 72% drop. But even with concerts and live events still uncertain, Live Nation stock is already above its pre-pandemic highs.


There are a number of reasons why. Among them [potential acquisitions of smaller players and pent-up demand leading to record revenues](https://www.investors.com/news/music-industry-faces-transformaton-artists-fight-spotify-coronavirus-closes-concert-venues/). Ultimately, our decision to add Live Nation stock to [SwingTrader](https://get.investors.com/swingtrader/?intcode=start%7Cstart%7Cprdmcst%7C2021%7Cna%7Cst%7Cna%7C%7C397709&src=A011LPH) came down to the chart.


LYV stock was on our [SwingTrader Watchlist](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swingtrader-watch-list/) as it pulled back to its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) at the end of March. It joined SwingTrader after a strong bounce from the 50-day line that turned into a big outside day **(1)**. These upside reversals can often be the start of a strong gain back near former highs.


TheÂ [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) was on the weaker side at the time but looked like it could quickly [break its downtrend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/) as well.


Live Nation stock followed up nicely the next day but its close was weak **(2)**. Over the next couple days, it pulled back to its 50-day moving average line but again got support and remained above the lows of our entry day **(3)**.

The Strength Comes And Goes
---------------------------


Once the Nasdaq composite had its [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), Live Nation stock seemed to perk up as well. As April started, Live Nation cleared its downtrend line more decisively and looked poised to run **(4)**. We took our first third off the position after reaching our 5% profit goal the next day **(5)**. It also ended up being just shy of a near-term top.


With many of our rotation and reopening plays, this is where things got tricky. Live Nation stock fell below its 5-day moving average **(6)** but it wasn't decisive and we've been using the 10-day line more often recently as a place to protect our profits.


As LYV stock fell more, it stopped right at its 10-day and 21-day line **(7)**. This would be a logical area of support. Even when that was broken, the 50-day line was not too far away offering another potential support area **(8)**. This line also coincided with the price level around 84 where the stock formed resistance around our initial entry **(1)**.


It wasn't until the clear break of the 50-day line that we had no choice but to throw in the towel **(9)**. But an important take-away here. As much room as we gave up off the top, we still ended the trade with a gain. How? The early profit taking **(5)**. We gave Live Nation stock a lot of room to work. Locking in a partial gain kept us from losing capital in the process.

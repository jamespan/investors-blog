Is the stock market correction over? Based on Friday's action, it doesn't look like it. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 lost their 200-day moving averages and there are still plenty of uncertainties with inverted yield curves, global recession fears and trade war skirmishes that could derail any progress. But we have had rally attempts and we will again. A good way to test the waters in those cases is with a half position. It starts your exposure should the market rally be for real. But should it falter, you're risking less and avoiding a hit to your portfolio. MercadoLibre stock provides a recent [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) example.




Swing Trading Strategy Example: MercadoLibre Stock
--------------------------------------------------


The setup for **MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) looked intriguing. After its [last earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/mercadolibre-earnings-mercadolibre-stock-q1/), the stock shot up 20% in a single day **(1)**. It pulled back over the next few days but still held the bulk of the gains and we put it on our watch list as it started a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) **(2)**.


Even as the stock market correction worsened, MercadoLibre seemed to shake it off. By May 16, the stock shot up to new high territory **(3).** The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 jumped above their [50-day moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) that day as well. We held off on triggering it as a current trade for IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on that day, however. In a note to subscribers early in the trading session, we cited [lackluster trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sherlock-holmes-and-the-case-of-missing-volume/) as our reason for waiting. The stock faltered from there but compared to the stock market correction that was unfolding, it was mild. That put the relative strength line at new high ground even when the price wasn't **(4)**.


Half Position Better For Stock Market Correction
------------------------------------------------


On May 28, the stock market rallied and Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 both got above their [10-day moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/). With a potential short-term market rally in the making, we revisited a potential play in MercadoLibre stock. After the open, it quickly launched above 600 and we added it as a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/) **(5).**While it could signal the start of a rally, we wanted to see how the market indexes closed. If this was truly the end of the stock market correction, could they stay above their 10-day lines? And could MercadoLibre stock keep its gains for the day?


Unfortunately, neither case happened. By the end of the day, a 1.6% gain from our entry turned negative and the market indexes closed near their lows and with losses. No reason to fill out the position without further proof of strength. The next day, the stock market correction worsened as the indexes undercut their recent lows. MercadoLibre stock hit our stop loss at 584 and we removed it **(6)**. By the end of the week, the stock gapped down and fell as low as 560. We avoided letting a mild loss get bigger. Even the 3% loss that we had on the position was cut in half due to the smaller position size. Less trading and smaller position sizes help protect capital in a stock market correction.

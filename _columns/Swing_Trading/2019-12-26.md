[Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) is about smaller profits in less time than your traditional position trading. But sometimes you might find yourself in a trade that could go either way. Disney stock fit this description in a recent trade.




Swing Trading Example: Disney Stock
-----------------------------------


In terms of news worthiness, **Walt Disney Company** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) fits the bill. This year saw a dominant performance at the box office, the launch of a new streaming service to hungry fans and new draws to its theme parks. [Despite a drop in year-over-year profits for its fourth quarter](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-earnings-slated-q4-2019-disney-stock/), Disney stock still gapped up nearly 4% after its report **(1)**. Credit the anticipated launch of Disney+ and its future growth potential as an important driver behind the move that day.


After a brief pause for a couple of days, Disney stock held the gains from the gap and then added to them with a powerful surge **(2)**. The first glance at [Disney+ numbers showed a launch to 10 million subscribers the first day](https://www.investors.com/news/disney-stock-tops-buy-point-disneyplus-10-million-users/). The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) was still below its high from August but was up considerably and breaking a recent downtrend **(3)**. We added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 141.92 and it rushed to our first 5% profit goal later the same day. We took half profits and raised our stop to 1% profit from our entry.

Disney stock pulled back briefly but got support at its rising 5-day moving average line **(4)**. It swelled to new highs a few days later but closed well off its highs on Nov. 26 after a gap up in price **(5)**.


Swing Trading Vs. Position Trading
----------------------------------


The market took a quick jolt on [China trade news](https://www.investors.com/news/china-u-s-trade-communist-tweets/) and we had a decision to make with Disney. Lose our position in a stock with potential or try to weather the storm. We relieved some pressure by removing stocks off our current trades list, but decided that Disney stock was worth giving more room. Especially since we already took half profits at 5%.


When it had its first close below the 5-day moving average line **(6)** it was only a quarter of a percent below the line. That doesn't qualify as a decisive close below a moving average line. Things got worse the next day but Disney stock got support closing near the top of its range for the day **(7)**. Plus, the latest Star Wars film *The Rise Of Skywalker* was on the horizon as another potential $1 billion revenue blockbuster for Disney.


As Disney stock drifted to 145, still above our raised stop, it got support again **(8)**. This became a new line in the sand. It was a logical area of support. The previous high in August was around 147 and we already weathered an early shakeout to 143.69 on its first shakeout to the 5-day line **(4)**.


Unfortunately, Disney stock couldn't get traction. Once it undercut 145, we finally exited the remaining position **(9)**. While it wasn't doing anything particularly wrong, it was hard to justify as a swing trade. Normally, we only hold a stock for a couple of weeks and this was now well over a month. However, Disney stock remained as a position on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard). With a longer time horizon and continued support around its old highs at 147, the position trade could still make sense.

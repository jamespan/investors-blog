Children often need to be warned about "the company they keep," lest they get burdened by unsavory friends. If only stocks could be as discriminating with their industry groups.


A solid stock setting up with a good group and a strong market behind it is akin to having your kids hang out with honor students who like to volunteer for charity work in their spare time. The odds of a successful outcome increase significantly. But many traders ignore the opposite scenario.


When the market turns weak, lagging industry groups often produce stocks that set up ideal [shorting](https://www.investors.com/short-selling/) opportunities. Taking advantage of converging weaknesses creates opportunities for profit when stocks go down. As a reminder, shorting is when you borrow shares to sell (you are short those shares) and if the price goes down, you make money by buying the shares back at the lower price. If the stock goes up, you may "cover" your position at a higher price and lose money on the trade.


Shorting can keep your portfolio humming even when the market isn't strong. Taking 5% profits quickly lends itself particularly well to a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategy.


**Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)) found itself with the wrong crowd over the summer, and [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) took advantage of it. The shipping transportation group started a downtrend in late 2014 and was bouncing back with the market in January 2016. By June it looked like it was getting in trouble again, especially after the U.K. voted to exit the European Union on June 24.


On that day, Kirby gapped below its 50-day moving average line **(1)** and a month later, the stock was below the longer-term 200-day moving average **(2)**.  An earnings report a few days later led to an 8% drop **(3)** on July 28; then the stock traded in a sideways range. The best opportunities for shorting usually come after the stock already has established a downtrend and a penchant for weakness. This is where a breakdown in support or a reversal from an area of resistance can lead to a high-probability short trade.


On Aug. 24, with the stock already more than 20% off its high, Kirby undercut recent support **(4)** at the same time the Nasdaq composite fell below its 10-day moving average line. Its industry group was ranked No. 193 out of 197, near the bottom of the barrel. It joined SwingTrader as a short sale at 54.49. The trade quickly reached 5% profit **(5)** as the stock fell and was covered on Aug. 26 at 51.77. Taking the 5% profit when we have it has been prudent since the market pullbacks have been so short and shallow.

As the bear market worsens, our [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) strategy continues to lean toward capital preservation. Recent market exposure trades provided a way to participate for fast moves in the S&P 500, Russell 2000, and Nasdaq 100. But it was the fast profit taking that made the trades successful and our overall low exposure that has led to outperformance versus the S&P 500.




The Rise Of The Resistance
--------------------------


A difficulty for progress this year has been the stickiness of [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/). The [10-week moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) (closely related to the 50-day line) provided support for the S&P 500 throughout most of 2020 and 2021. But that support failed in early 2022. The breach of that level opened the S&P 500 later to a breach of its longer-term 40-week moving average (closely related to the 200-day line).


While July saw a strong rally in the indexes, the 200-day line once again acted as resistance with the S&P 500 quickly backing away after coming up to the line **(1)**. This was also when [we exited a market exposure position in the Russell 2000](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-we-handled-bear-market-rally-in-russell-2000/).


All the indexes started to lose ground as the bear market regained its stranglehold **(2)**. We turned our attention to a short position in the Nasdaq 100. But even that short position didn't last long. We took profits quickly and closed it on support at the 21-day line **(3).** One of the reasons was due to expected volatility on Jackson Hole statements by Fed chair Jerome Powell the next day **(4)**.


The short position would have been much more profitable if we held it because the market indexes took another leg down **(5)**. But our main goal during a bear market is for capital preservation and reduced risk. Statements by the Fed tend to add volatility and increase the likelihood of unfavorable exits.


A Bear Market Rally For S&P 500
-------------------------------


The S&P 500 was due for a bounce after a punishing two-week drop heading into Labor Day. Our light exposure gave us a boost of outperformance and the flexibility to try and play the bounce **(6)**. We opted for ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ([SSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSO)), a double-leveraged ETF on the S&P 500.


One benefit of an S&P 500 related ETF, is the limitations on risk. We already had light exposure and the position in SSO wouldn't do more damage than the S&P 500 would suffer should the trade not work. If the market rallies substantially, the double leverage gives us a foot in the door for participation. We would underperform in a rally due to the light exposure, but not as much.


Quick Profit Taking Saves The Trade
-----------------------------------


As the bounce unfolded, we still employed a quick profit-taking strategy, especially since we are still in a bear market. Once we had a 3% gain in SSO **(7)**, remember it's double the S&P 500, we took our first third of the position off to lock in the gain.


Our second third of the position got locked in after a 7% gain the next day **(8)**. That also happened to be the near-term top in the S&P 500.


So when the S&P 500 opened below its 50-day line the next day **(9)**, we already had a reduced position because of our profit taking. We exited the remaining position while we were still above our entry. The end result was a 3.75% gain for the trade in SSO in what's been a horrible month so far.

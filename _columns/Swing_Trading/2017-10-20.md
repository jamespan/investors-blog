Balancing risk and reward is one of the toughest and most important jobs of a [swing trader](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). Stocks that move quickly can turn into your biggest winners but may come with a larger risk at the outset. Using a half position allows you to get an earlier, low-cost entry as a starting point. If the strength continues, you have a little cushion and better average cost for a subsequent buy at a higher price. If the stock turns against you, that half position spares your portfolio from a larger loss.


The **Direxion S&P Biotech Bull 3X** ([LABU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LABU)) was a recent use of an initial half position on [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that minimized what could have been a larger loss.


Biotech stocks are volatile: Clinical trials, approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, and news on competitors can all make for a wild ride in individual names. An exchange traded fund, such as LABU, can give you exposure to moves in the biotech sector with assets spread out among individual stocks — to reduce risk from one stock tanking your portfolio. The 3X-leverage on the ETF makes the moves larger and more in line with what an individual growth name would provide.


Over the past couple of months, the biotech sector has moved well between short consolidations. On Aug. 22 **(1)**, as the market shifted from a minor correction back to an uptrend, LABU started a move that would see a 30% gain over the span of two weeks. After a three-week consolidation with little progress, the biotechs made another run starting on Sept. 28 **(2)** that was good for another 10% move in LABU.


With that backdrop, a pullback and subsequent [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) could provide a way to participate in a similar strong move. That opportunity presented itself on Oct. 16 **(3)** as the leveraged ETF gapped up at the open, after six days of losses put it just below its 10-day moving average.


Trading shortly after the open is notorious for its extra volatility, but as LABU got back above its 10-day line and showed no signs of stopping, it seemed that waiting too long would lead to a missed opportunity or much higher risk due to a higher entry. SwingTrader added it with an initial half position to help mitigate those risks.


The ETF initially continued its strong open and within a half-hour of our entry, we were up 2.6%. The next hour LABU settled to just above our entry and then plummeted quickly. We removed it the same day after taking out the prior day's low. What would have been one of the top five worst losses for SwingTrader was half that, because of the reduced position. That put it in line with an average loss.


It was a rare occasion where a swing trade ended up as a [day trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/day-trading-versus-swing-trading-comes-down-to-time/), our only one in nearly 18 months. We try to avoid day trades, but it is more important to act quickly to reduce losses rather than allow a trade to inflict an oversized loss to your portfolio. Waiting an extra day or two saw an undercut of LABU's lows **(4)**, which only got worse as the week went on.

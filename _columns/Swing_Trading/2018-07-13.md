[Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) relies heavily on technical analysis. While many traders may focus on a stock's price action, a stock's volume is also a critical component for trading success. Heavy trading volume confirms the strength of price moves and can identify flaws in price moves that might be weaker than they look.




Why Trading Volume Is Important
-------------------------------


Trading volume serves two main functions for a swing trader's analysis. First, it identifies liquidity. When there is more trading volume you have a whole host of players competing with their best prices buying and selling shares. It makes the spread tighter and more competitive between the bid and the ask (the best price you can sell or buy a stock for). Second, heavy volume identifies when there is intensity behind price action. You could have a jump in price from a single transaction of a few hundred shares and it doesn't tell you much. A jump in price due to thousands of transactions with lots of money trading hands gives the price move more meaning. It's often the result of trading by institutions, like the big mutual funds.


But what does it mean to have heavy volume? Heavy compared to what? A million shares traded in **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) would be remarkable for how low it is. For a stock like **Dominos Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)), a million shares is double its 50-day average volume. In position trades, the 50-day average volume is a good standard to measure against. But for swing trading, the shorter time frame changes your comparison. With a target of a 10-day trade length, you can use the volume relative to the past couple weeks as a gauge.


Swing Trading Example: Ross Stores
----------------------------------


When **Ross Stores** ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)) initially [broke out](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/), it wasn't suitable as a position trade due to low volume. But we kept it on our radar for a short-term move as a swing trade.


A move to new highs after an eight-day consolidation saw volume that was lower than nearly all of the eight prior days **(1)**. A brief try to new high ground quickly saw a lack of demand and a subsequent decline **(2)**. A few days later it joined IBD's SwingTrader as a watch list stock **(3)**. Its tight trading was compelling, especially since the market was declining. The retail group was also one of the strongest out there. If we could get trading volume behind a price move, that could increase our chances for success.


On June 27, Ross Stores vaulted 2% in the morning. We sent an alert out that we were waiting for a better read on trading volume before triggering the trade, but it never came. After a couple hours into the trading session, the stock erased its gains for the day and was in negative territory. It ended with an ugly bearish reversal for the day **(4)**.


We avoided a losing trade by using the volume clue. Although it hasn't dropped sharply, at best it would have been dead money for a few weeks. Sometimes it's the trades you don't do that can make the difference.

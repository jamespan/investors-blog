**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has clearly been one of the leaders following the coronavirus stock market crash. It's a full position in [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and has made multiple appearances on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). Here are three [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) lessons offered by Amazon stock.




Don't Let Leaders Like Amazon Stock Drop Off Your Radar
-------------------------------------------------------


It's important to be disciplined in your swing trading. Buying extended and chasing stocks up can easily lead to bigger losses when they don't work. When they do work, you run the risk of being shaken out early because you aren't positioned properly. There's an opportunity cost to that mistake.


With Amazon stock, we already had a nice move on SwingTrader from an [upside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/great-gains-swing-trading-reversals-dynatrace-stock/) **(1)** on June 29 to a dramatic downside reversal **(2)** on July 13. With more than a 17% gain on the trade in just a couple weeks, it would be easy to say Amazon stock gave enough. But [leading stocks tend to offer multiple chances](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/third-time-was-a-charm-for-netflix-stock/).


Don't Be Discouraged By Setups That Don't Work
----------------------------------------------


Amazon stock has been on SwingTrader nine times this year. They haven't all worked. But the gains have more than made up for the losses. That's the benefit of keeping losses small and admitting early that your timing might be off.


In the last few weeks, we actually avoided some decent looking days because of the [overall market health](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/nasdaq-composite-provides-guidance-for-swing-trading/). A nearly 8% gain on July 20 **(3)** seemed strong, but it was too soon after the major downside reversal in the market July 13.

A gap up after earnings looked promising **(4)**, but was too extended as a swing trade so we passed on it. After consolidating a few days, Amazon stock tried again **(5)**. We added it to SwingTrader that day. After a brief move up, it went down for three days along with the market. We tried to give Amazon stock room but it ultimately hit our stop loss **(6)** and we exited near the lows.


While it wasn't doing anything wrong as a position trade, it wasn't acting right as a swing trade. You can turn a swing trade into a position trade once you are up on it. However, it's not a good idea to switch when you're down on a position. When you start changing your rules to justify a losing position you're asking for trouble. But don't be afraid to buy it back at a higher price if another setup presents itself.


Alternative Entries Can Build Cushion Quicker
---------------------------------------------


Finally, you don't have to wait for stocks to break out to all time highs for an entry. The [handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/) of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/) gets you an earlier entry. Downtrend lines or earlier areas of resistance are also viable options.


Rather than wait for Amazon stock to rise to its all-time high, made on July 13 **(2)**, an earlier entry presented itself this past week. An earlier line of resistance could be drawn just above 3200. Notice that many of the previous failed attempts mentioned got turned away at the similar level of price.


When Amazon stock moved above that area **(7)**, we added it again. Should it fall back below that area, we'll have an early indication the trade isn't working. We can easily keep our loss small.


Should Amazon move above its previous high, we'll already have a 2% profit. The extra cushion can help us end up with another profitable trade.

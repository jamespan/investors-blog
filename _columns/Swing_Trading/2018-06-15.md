The decision to sell a stock depends on your time frame. Where position trading looks at holding a stock for a couple of months, [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) focuses on just a couple of weeks. The shorter trade requires more sensitive sell rules. That extra sensitivity led us to sell Alibaba stock on IBD's SwingTrader but hold Alibaba on IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/).




The traditional [buy point](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) on **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) showed a 201.60 entry from a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-2/). An early entry presented itself as the stock hit resistance multiple times around 200. We added Alibaba to IBD's SwingTrader on May 25 as the price crossed that area, but it didn't hold above it by the close **(1)**. The next day, Alibaba challenged the price level again but failed **(2)**. With the market still trading flat, we took half the position off the table as a cautionary measure.


A few days later, the stock recovered and cleared its traditional buy point **(3)**. Buying the shares back would be an option at this point. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) cleared new highs more definitively **(3)** than at our original buy **(1)**. But [volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) was a little light for a traditional breakout and the market was just starting to regain steam.


Why Sell Alibaba Stock?
-----------------------


Alibaba continued to make progress and reached our 5% profit goal as it crossed 210 **(4)**. Normally, this would trigger our rule to sell half the position. In this case, since we only had a half position, it changed the math. That would leave us with a quarter-position size. It's hard to make much impact when your position size gets too small. You can also fall into the trap of ignoring losses because they are smaller and holding stocks longer than necessary. We decided to hold Alibaba early in the day for a 10% profit goal. We still [raised our stop](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) to 1% profit from our entry. But, we saw another bearish reversal **(4)** by the close leaving us less certain.


The following day, Alibaba didn't participate in a strong market move and we removed the remaining shares around 208 **(5)**. The change in character was enough to suggest that the stock might struggle over the next few days. That's not something you want to sit with in a swing trade. For a position trade, the decision could be different. That's why the stock stayed on IBD's Leaderboard at the time. Different sell rules apply to swing trades over position trades.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *IBD's Leaderboard is already up over 21% year-to-date while the S&P 500's gain is under 4%. Alibaba is one of 11 stocks on the Leaders List. [Trial subscriptions](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/) are available.*

The decision to sell Alibaba stock worked well for the swing trade. The next day it was down nearly 3% closing well below its 5-day moving average line **(6)**. More than a week later and it's still trading around the same level as our sell. As for Leaderboard, the stock is still contributing to profits there. Its relative strength line is still holding up and Alibaba got support at its 10-day moving average line. Its fundamental story of retail dominance in China is compelling. The different sell decisions may prove to both be correct for their respective time frames.

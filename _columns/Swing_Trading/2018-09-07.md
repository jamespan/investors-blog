When to sell stocks for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) profits is always a delicate balance. Fear of missing out on a big move makes many investors hesitate to book profits as a stock rises. Once the stock declines, they may hold too long waiting for the stock to return to its former highs. Using a price target, you can take some money off the table and have the best of both worlds.




You still participate if the stock continues up, just not as much. If the stock turns lower, the earlier sell helps protect some of your profits for an overall higher gain on the entire trade. A raised stop loss helps secure your profits for the remaining shares.


Price targets serve an important function for swing trades and in life. Motivational and sales guru Zig Ziglar was a firm believer at setting targets. He famously noted, "You can't hit a target you can't see," and, "If you aim at nothing, you'll hit it every time." But that doesn't mean you shouldn't change your aim as you go along. The stock market is certainly an ever-moving target.


Take **Medpace Holdings** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)), a highly-ranked member of the [IPO Leaders](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/) list. [Medpace stock had an earnings-fueled](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/new-highs-stocks-illumina-ipo-stock-medpace/) gap up of 30% at the end of July **(1)**. As [noted in the New Highs column that day](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/new-highs-stocks-illumina-ipo-stock-medpace/), a pullback was likely. Over the next month, Medpace stock drifted nearly 15% lower but remained well above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/).


When To Sell Stocks: Let The Market Guide Your Price Target
-----------------------------------------------------------


A strong rally put Medpace stock above prior resistance and its short-term downtrend line on increased [volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) **(2)**. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day. As usual, we set an initial price target of 5%. In the current market environment, this is where we typically take half profits and [raise our stop loss to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry. After the Labor Day holiday, it looked like Medpace stock would easily hit the price target, but it fell short by 8 cents **(3)**.


This is where flexibility in your price target can help. The stock market environment looked extended and [psychological market indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=bullsbears) suggested excessive bullishness. As Medpace stock pulled back from its intraday high, we took half profits and raised the stop loss anyway. Rather than remaining rigid with our price target, our flexibility compromised on a few tenths of a percent.


Medpace stock fell below its raised stop loss the next day and exited SwingTrader **(4)**. Our original stop loss for Medpace stock was 57.11 and it fell below that level the next day. The raised stop loss protected the remaining profit from another 4% drop that put Medpace stock 8% off its high. The compromised price target combined with the raised stop loss salvaged about a 2.5% gain for the overall trade — a trade that easily could have turned out negative.


The sell doesn't reflect on the long-term prospects for the stock. Strong earnings growth for a relatively new issue is promising. Its services are in high demand by biotech firms outsourcing aspects of their clinical trials. A quick gain in a weakening market doesn't preclude a later position in the same stock with a different price target. It may bounce back quickly or need more time to consolidate for a new opportunity. Either way, the flexibility in price target based on market conditions can lead to overall powerful results in your trading career.

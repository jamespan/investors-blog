Is the coronavirus bear market over? The current stock market rally is showing staying power and that shifted our [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) strategy. We don't know how long the rally will last. But if we ignore it out of fear, we will be left behind. To that end, here is how we played the recent strength in semiconductor stocks. First with sector exposure then a shift to the leaders AMD stock and Nvidia stock. Moving money to the leaders is the IBD way.




Swing Trading Strategy: Ramping Up Exposure With Follow-Through Day
-------------------------------------------------------------------


The change in our market outlook started April 2 with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) for the S&P 500. It wasn't until the Nasdaq composite staged its own follow-through day that our swing trading shifted to high gear. As we looked for quick ways to increase exposure, the **VanEck Vectors Semiconductors ETF** ([SMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) offered an opportunity. The semiconductor stocks looked strong and made the Nasdaq stronger relative to the S&P 500. We started a full position in the semiconductor ETF on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) when the Nasdaq followed through April 6 **(1)**. Along with other adds, it brought our exposure from 0% invested to 38% invested by the end of the day. The ETF gave us exposure to the sector but without the volatility of the individual stocks.

The next day, we hit our 5% profit goal **(2)**. We followed our customary swing trading strategy of [taking half profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) and [raising our stop to a 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) from our entry. There was a [downside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) that day. Not a great sign. Our profit taking was near the highs of the day. Since we booked some profits already it helped us feel more confident in our remaining position.


Semiconductors Stalling?
------------------------


The next day was an inside day **(3)**. The low was higher than the previous day's low and the high was lower than the previous day's high. Was our approach to the 200-day line stalling? With swing trading, our focus is generally on shorter moving averages but it's important to recognize areas where resistance may be present. We trimmed our remaining position in half leaving just a quarter position.


The following day, April 9, preceded a three-day market weekend **(4)**. With so much uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus shutdown, weekend headlines run the risk of dramatically shifting outlooks. We employed "[weekend retreats](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-fears-spark-another-weekend-retreat/)" to our swing trading strategy starting in January as a way to deal with the headlines. Sure, we run the risk of missing out on gains. But we know things could easily go the other way over a long weekend.  We removed our remaining position in the semiconductor ETF around the same level as our previous exit. It was right before another downside reversal.


The Shift To Leaders: AMD Stock And Nvidia Stock
------------------------------------------------


Notably, while the semiconductor ETF was down 2.3%, two leaders in the group fared much better. **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) was only down 0.8% while **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was off 1.1%. A key strategy of IBD Founder William J. O'Neil involved shifting money to the leaders as quickly as possible. The same strategy can apply to swing trading.


We started a half position in AMD stock first **(5)** and then added a half position in Nvidia stock the next day **(6)**. Both days, the individual stocks vastly outperformed the semiconductor ETF. Importantly, when the semiconductor ETF had a down day **(7)** of 2.7%, Nvidia stock was down less than half of that and AMD stock closed up. That's the ideal action of leaders.


Leading Stocks Provide Results
------------------------------


We took profits in both on their way up, but tended to give them more room as half positions. By the close on April 16, we were out of AMD stock and down to a quarter position in Nvidia stock. Comparing the move in the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF to the leaders is informative. From our exit April 9 exit at 126.49 to the April 16 close **(8)** at 130.83, SMH was up 3.6%. Our entry in Nvidia stock was already extended 6.6% from its close on April 9 and we still got another 5.1% out of it by April 16. AMD stock was even better. Though up 4.1% for the day at our entry, AMD stock went up another 14.4% before our final exit. The IBD way is to put your money to work in the leaders whenever possible. This swing trading example makes the reason clear.

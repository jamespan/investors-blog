Solar stocks often offer big moves in short periods of time. It makes them ideal for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). But to avoid getting burned, you have to grab profits when you can. That's how we recently played SunPower stock.




With this swing trade, news was a factor. On Sept. 16, oil saw a 15% rise after [drone strikes hit Saudi Arabia](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/crude-oil-soars-energy-stocks-rise-consumer-stocks-fall/). The disruption to the global oil supply also spilled over into solar stocks with a 2% move in Invesco Solar ETF ([TAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TAN)). But the solar stock group was already one of the strongest groups. It was in the top five groups out of 197 for the previous six months. **SunPower** ([SPWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPWR)) easily established itself as one of the leaders of the group.


Swing Trading Example: SunPower Stock
-------------------------------------


Following the sharp rise in oil on Sept. 16, the next day saw a considerable pullback. But rather than losing their gains, [solar stocks jumped even more](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/oil-prices-and-solar-stocks-sunpower-solaredge-first-solar-stocks-near-buy-points/). Recognizing this divergence, [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) added SunPower stock early in the trading session **(1)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) showed a sharp bounce up and approached recent highs **(2)**. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) was also tracking much higher than recent activity and well above average **(3)**.


At the time of the alert to subscribers, SunPower stock was at 13.54. The early strength continued to intensify. It got close to our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) about an hour later and we took half profits at 14.05. It isn't our norm to have [day trades](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/day-trading-versus-swing-trading-comes-down-to-time/) but when we hit our profit targets or stops, we still act regardless of time elapsed. We also [raised our stop to 1% profit.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/)That's one of our swing trading rules that helps keep trades positive.


Grabbing Profits Before The Solar Stock Fall
--------------------------------------------


At its peak on our entry day, SunPower stock was up an astounding 9% from our entry. While it's easy to dream of how much further it can go, you should also be mindful of how quickly the profits can be lost. The following day, SunPower stock pulled back and we exited the remaining position at 14.18, right around the 5% profit goal **(4)**.


Given the strong move up, the pullback was mild. However, our decision also considered an upcoming [Fed announcement](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-cut-fed-meeting-sends-mixed-signals-dow-jones/). We figured the extra volatility that comes with Fed announcements could easily knock SunPower stock down to our raised stop. After initial pressure on the downside, stocks moved off their lows by the end of the day.


The next day, SunPower stock nearly hit 15% profit from our entry at its peak **(5)**. That can be frustrating to see a stock go up without you. The gains didn't last, though. A few days later and SunPower stock plunged through its five-day moving average line, ending well below our exit price **(6)**. The drop didn't stop there. In just over a week's time, SunPower stock dropped 25%. Taking the profits when we had them kept some gain and avoided a lot of pain.

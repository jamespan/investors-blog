Many times the bulk of a stock move comes quickly. The goal of swing trading is to capture that gain and move on to the next one. But there is also the power of compounding that happens with gains that come later. Taking early profits in SQ stock left some on the table for an even bigger gain down the road.




Swing Trading Example: SQ Stock
-------------------------------


**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) had one of the most powerful moves of 2017 and into 2018. It was truly model-book worthy. But after its top, SQ stock couldn't seem to find traction. In 2020, things have changed.


Square stock showed leading action in May and it joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on June 15 with an [upside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) **(1)**. Not only was it an outside day, it was powerful enough to engulf the prior two days. And the relative strength line was already hitting new highs ahead of the price. The strength continued the next day with a gap up to its highest level in years **(2)**. We locked in profit on a third after hitting a [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/).


The next day was up again **(3)**, and we took another third in profit with an 8.3% gain from our initial entry. SQ stock didn't show signs of slowing down but it was coming up to a psychological century market at 100. That matched up with a potential area of resistance near its all-time high in 2018.


**Holding Square Stock Had Its Rewards**
----------------------------------------


With the bulk of the position locked in with profits, you have a lot of freedom to give a stock room to gain more. Should it fall, you don't sacrifice much in the overall gain for the trade. But there's a downside. Should the stock go on a big move, you will have less participation in the move due to the earlier profit taking.

As SQ stock continued higher, it had some down days. But it closed below the short-term five-day moving average **(4)** on only two days **(5).**The 10-day moving average also provided support as the stock took a brief pause. This also coincided to the area of the old 2018 highs. A good place to get support. Even if SQ stock breached those levels, we could still exit the trade with roughly an 8% gain due to the early profit taking.


The waiting paid off in this case with a 10% jump in Square stock on July 1 **(6)**. We gave it one more day and then took the remaining position off at a point up nearly 29% from our initial entry. Even though it was a smaller position by that point, it still boosted the overall trade from under 10% to over 14%. While this was a longer hold, it was still under three weeks for a very healthy gain.


Even better, those gains are available to compound with the next winning swing trade.

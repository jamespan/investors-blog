Successful [swing-trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategy relies on the proper stock market environment. April wasn't great in that regard. But with a new crop of leaders showing promise, it might be time to turn the profit engine on again.




When you suspect a bottom in a market correction, your first reaction shouldn't be to jump back in aggressively and blindly. A useful swing-trading strategy is to use [test buys](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-godaddy-stock-swing-trading-strategy/) and see how they work. April was full of [bearish reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) as the indexes marched to their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). Single buys at a time reduced exposure as the market struggled. As test buys failed, cutting losses quickly avoided getting too hurt. There's no need to increase exposure until you start making progress. That's your defense.


Swing-Trading Example Suggests A Turn
-------------------------------------


**Pure Storage** ([PSTG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSTG)) was a test buy used on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) last week. On May 7, it cleared an area of [price resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) and joined at 21.70 **(1)**. The [RS line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) hit new highs, well before a price high, and volume looked heavier than average **(1)**. That confirmed the strength and improved the odds of success.


The gains came fast. By the end of the day, we achieved the 5% profit goal and took half profits just below that level **(2)**. That is a [day trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/day-trading-versus-swing-trading-comes-down-to-time/), technically, but shouldn't be a concern. Day trades happen rarely on SwingTrader. Certainly not enough to get you flagged as a pattern day trader.


As is our custom, we also [raised our stop to 1% profit above our entry](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/). We don't want a solid gain to go negative. When pulling back that much, the danger increases that the stock may not find support. In most cases, even if the stop is hit, you still exit with an average of around 3% for the trade with both sells.


Pure Storage flirted with the stop a couple times, then exited SwingTrader just below the stop at the time of our alert **(3)**. Averaging both sells came to a 2.8% gain on SwingTrader by holding the stock for just one day. The stock did recover considerable ground by the end of the day. Pure Storage pushed to new highs the following day. Then, it hit the 10% profit goal from our entry the day after that **(4)**.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Want to hold for longer? Pure Storage was also added to IBD's Leaderboard on May 7. Leaderboard has a longer holding period with position trading over swing trading. Leaderboard performance is more than four times the S&P 500 right now. [Trials](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/) are available.*

Time For Offense?
-----------------


The strength in our test buy suggests an improved stock market for swing trading. The major indexes notched solid gains for five straight days and are back above their 50-day moving averages. We moved the market action from sideways trend to uptrend. It's a big difference from the reluctant gains and bearish reversals of April. But the five straight days of gains also gave us pause. It's a little late to get aggressive.


That doesn't mean the opportunities are over. This is where a break in the move would be welcome. Friday was a good start. If the pause continues, we'll be looking for new setups. Stocks that show tight action and pullbacks to short-term moving averages should appear. If the stock market indexes can hold above their 50-day moving averages, it may still be early in the game for profit.

Rather than hold a stock for a long move, sometimes it's best to take the quick profit when you have it. When ONON stock started running, a 10% profit in one week was enough to satisfy us. Here's how we handled the trade.




Lacing Up ONON Stock
--------------------


Shoemakers often can change leadership and that seems to be happening now with Swiss-based shoemaker **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)). Its last earnings report **(1)** showed a lot of price discovery but started a solid run **(2)**. Rival **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) led for most of the prior two years but gave up its leadership mantle in May.


After a weak start in the stock market for September, ONON stock found support at its 21-day line **(3)**. It then tightened up for the next few days. When indexes showed a big upside reversal on Sept. 11, ONON stock again got support at its 21-day and was an early mover **(4)**. It joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day.

ONON started as a half position as we tested the waters but due to its strength we added another quarter position later the same day after making progress.


We finished our position with another quarter the next day **(5)** making it a full position. ONON was breaking above resistance from its Aug. 27 high **(2)**, but we were already at a 7% gain from our initial entry. We stayed content with our full position and low average cost.


September Starts On Rocky Road
------------------------------


As ONON edged higher we enjoyed the gains and let it run. But a strong pop on Sept. 18 seemed like a gift that made it worth locking inÂ  some profits **(6)**. We were up 4% from our latest quarter add and we trimmed that quarter. We had an 11% gain from our initial entry.


The next day saw the stock reverse the gains and we started selling as it kept dropping throughout the day **(7)**. By the end of the day, we were out of ONON with over a 9% gain in the trade in just under a week.


But that doesn't mean we are done with the stock. Usually a reversal like that would lead to more weakness in the short term. And ONON did get worse the next day but then it held tight over the next four days **(8)**.


The tight action is a strong cue that this stock might be ready to go again.

The last couple months have been great for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). Upside reversals are a big reason why — not only in the general market but also in individual stocks and exchange traded funds. Just go back a couple of weeks and you can see plenty of examples from the middle of June.




Market Action Is Your Tell For Stock Action
-------------------------------------------


The most powerful reversals usually occur when the stock market in general also shows a reversal. If you look at a chart of the Nasdaq composite, some of the pullbacks seem dramatic. It feels even worse when you put a dollar amount lost on the move down.


Don't put all your focus on defense during these times. If they are short-lived, you need to be prepared to quickly go back on the offense for your swing trading. It's more like the quick shifts from defense to offense in basketball rather than football.


For the Nasdaq composite, the clearest reversal examples over the last two months came on May 4 and 14, and June 15. **Dynatrace** ([DT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DT)) was one of the winners from this last reversal.

Swing Trading Example: Dynatrace Stock
--------------------------------------


Dynatrace stock pulled back to its 21-day moving average line and on June 15 had a strong bounce **(1)**. It joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day as it crossed the previous day's high.


The low of the day undercut the lows of the prior two days. The undercut, often after three days of pulling back, is normal behavior prior to a reversal. At our entry above the previous day's high, it was an outside day. That's where the high is higher and the low is lower than the previous day.


An outside day is an important swing trading indicator. It gives an expectation for the direction to follow.


The general market was like wind at its back and as the market got stronger, so did Dynatrace. Nearly three hours later, as we approached the final hour of trading, taking profit on a third made sense with over 4% profit. Swing trading [tends to sell into strength](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-into-strength-can-maximize-profit-in-swing-trades/). Even if you see the stock go up without you, it can help you manage most short-term positions better.


The final hour saw Dynatrace finish strong and the high closing range gave the expectation of further gains for the stock.


That's exactly what happened the next day. After being up more than 7.5% from our initial entry, we took another third off **(2)**.


The Closing Range Change
------------------------


As gains for Dynatrace stock continued, the closing ranges started to change. Both June 17 and 19 saw solid gains but with a close well off highs, respectively **(3)** and **(4)**.


A little over a week later came the worst closing range for Dynatrace stock, with barely a gain **(5)**. That's a [downside reversal,](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) another important swing trading indicator. It suggests weakness to follow. We removed the remaining third with 30 minutes left in the trading session.


While the stock didn't fall apart, weakness did come as expected the next day **(6)**. Just as the upside reversal was a good indicator of strength, the downside reversal signaled weakness. By the end of the week, Dynatrace was nearly 4% below our swing trading exit. Taking profits on the way up can help reduce volatility on the way down while keeping strong returns on the way up.

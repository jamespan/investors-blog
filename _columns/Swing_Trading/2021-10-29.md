In last week's column, we featured how a [second swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/lac-stock-a-second-chance-proved-profitable/) try in **Lithium Americas** ([LAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LAC)) proved profitable. In case you missed the LAC stock example, we'll revisit the topic with SE stock.




Swing Trading Example: SE Stock
-------------------------------


**Sea Limited** ([SE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SE)) is one of those stocks that produced phenomenal returns after the coronavirus crash. After the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) in April 2020, SE stock produced a whopping 500% without a single close below the [10-week line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).



After forming a base and posting another move, SE stock started basing again. We added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on Oct. 7 after it hugged its 50-day moving average line and bounced higher **(1)**. A problem from the start was the lack of follow-up buying after our entry. Though it closed with a gain of 2.8% for the day, that was about half the gain it had earlier in the session.


The next day SE stock retraced the trading range of the prior day and again closed near its lows with a small loss **(2).**Because of the weak start, we quickly shed the position the next day as it looked to close back below the 50-day line **(3)**.


Another Second Try Pays Off
---------------------------


Just a few days later, we added SE stock to SwingTrader again **(4)**. The follow-through day didn't come until the next day, but individual stocks gave their own early indicators. More setups occurred and buy signals saw continued buying. In other words, the setups were working.


In the case of SE stock, we also had a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) getting to new highs before the price and the highest trading volume in over a month.


The follow-up buying came quickly in this case and we [took our first third of profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/why-we-took-profits-into-strength-on-stld-stock/) later the same day with a 3% gain from our entry.


Weakness came the next day **(5)** but wasn't bad when put in context. It was a loss of 1.1% following a gain of 7.5%. With that much cushion, you can afford to give a position some room. Though it closed low in the trading range for that day, we still kept the bulk of the gains from the day before.

Selling Into Strength Avoids Drawdowns
--------------------------------------


We took our second of profit in SE stock after seeing a gain of 9% from our entry **(6)**. It just so happened to be one point away from the near-term top. The drop the next day remained above the 5-day moving average so we gave the stock a little bit of room **(7)**. The bounce from the short-term moving average **(8)** was lackluster and remained an inside day, but wasn't alarming. When we undercut the recent lows and moved below the 5-day moving average we decided to lock in the remaining profits **(9)**.


Our cushion above our entry afforded us the possibility of giving SE stock more room, but the early sell turned out to be the better move. Otherwise, we would have most likely gotten shaken out as SE stock moved below our entry. We don't let a solid gain turn negative on us. It's worth noting that SE stock is currently finding support at its 21-day moving average line so it may be one to consider for another swing trading setup down the road.

Though holding periods are shorter for swing trading, it isn't a one-and-done type of trading strategy. The gains might be smaller, but if you pile them up they can build into a sizable return over a year's time. Plus you might find certain stocks, or sectors, are good for multiple swing trades in a market cycle. That was certainly the case with gold miners recently.




Swing Trading Example: Gold Miners ETF
--------------------------------------


Buying stocks related to commodities can be tough. But you can still take advantage of short-term swing trading trends. That's what put the gold miners back on our radar in mid-July after multiple trades earlier this year. With what looked to be sideways action in the market, the relative strength line on VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF ([GDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDX)) was near new highs as GDX got support at its 5- and 10-day moving averages **(1)**.


GDX joined SwingTrader that day and we were already taking a portion of profits the next session with a 3% profit **(2)**. Once we hit our 5% profit goal, we often reconsider what kind of potential we see in a position. In this case, the 5% profit goal hit just two days in and we took another portion of profits **(3)**.

Gold Soars But How Long Do You Hold
-----------------------------------


Gold and the gold miners gapped up strongly July 27 **(4)**. Because we had already [sold into strength](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-into-strength-can-maximize-profit-in-swing-trades/), we felt OK giving GDX some more room. We had more than a 10% gain from our entry. And while we didn't want to give up a good swing-trading profit, sometimes you have to risk a little for further rewards.


The short-term moving averages can help raise your line in the sand for exiting a position to retain your profits. So when the gold miners ETF fell below both the 5- and 10-day moving averages we exited the remaining position **(5)**.


It was a 5.4% gain on the trade in just a couple of weeks. That might not seem like much, but compound enough trades like that and you can get fantastic results. Indeed, SwingTrader ideas have shown over a 60% gain for the year.


Another Trade Sets Up
---------------------


Swing trading also helps take the pressure off by reducing exposure during pullbacks. That might mean re-buying some positions as they set up again. GDX showed a nice reversal after getting support at its 10-day line **(6)** and then saw a quick 5% gain in a day shortly after **(7)**. This one might have been a shorter hold. As noted on [IBD Live](https://research.investors.com/ibdlive/?id=IBD-Live&src=A00582A), we saw a divergence between gold and silver prices and the miners on Thursday **(8)**. It was an early warning for caution but still left you with a second potential profitable trade for the month.

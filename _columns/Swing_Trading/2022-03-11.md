With the general market indexes in downtrends, it's surprising to see so many stocks resisting the selling pressure. These are the stocks we've gravitated toward and FCX stock is a recent [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) example that closed with a nice profit.




Swing Trading Example: FCX Stock
--------------------------------


**Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) is one of those stocks that seems to regularly find its way onÂ [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). Our success generally comes from reversal opportunities in FCX stock.


We are still getting most of our outperformance from staying on the sidelines while the market falls. However, we'll take a few probing positions just to have some exposure in case the market turns.


With FCX stock, it had a strong move starting in the latter part of 2020 and lasting about a year. It topped out at 46.10 and carved a long cup base that started in May 2021.


More recently, FCX stock got back to its previous high and tested it twice, once in January **(1)** and again in February **(2)**. Then it pulled back in an orderly fashion and drifted below its short-term, 5- and 10-day moving average lines. After FCX stock undercut recent lows, it showed a strong reversal after finding support at its 50-day moving average line **(3)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) was already at new highs ahead of the price, and trading volume confirmed the supporting price action. This is where we made our entry on SwingTrader.


The entry happened on a dramatic reversal in the market indexes. The Nasdaq composite dropped roughly 3.5% that day, undercutting its Jan. 24 reversal, then powered higher for a 3.3% gain at the close. Notably, FCX stock held well above its recent lows.


Holding The Short-Term Moving Averages
--------------------------------------


Freeport followed up on the strength the next day and we started taking profits **(4)**. We took our first third profit after hitting a 3% gain shortly after the open. As the day progressed, FCX stock was up 7% from our entry and we took another third profit later in the same trading session.

With most of the position locked in as profits, we have the flexibility to let a stock run. The 5- and 10-day moving averages can provide a good line in the sand for protecting profits should the stock start rolling over. They can act almost like a trailing stop.


Downside reversals can provide another signal to exit a position. That was a concern on March 1, but even though FCX stock closed well off its highs that day, it was still up 2% at the close **(5)**.


But it held its ground staying inside the wider range over the next two days and eventually getting support at its 5-day line **(6)**.


Locking In Gains For The Trade
------------------------------


When FCX stock dropped below its 5-day moving average for the first time, we made our final exit **(7)**. The stock had eight consecutive gains and that warranted a pause. But that didn't mean we had to hold it during its break.


But neither should it drop off the radar. As it got support at its 21-day exponential moving average on a bullish reversal **(8)**, FCX stock looked poised for another potential opportunity.

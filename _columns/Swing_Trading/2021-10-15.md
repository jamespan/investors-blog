Of recent swing trading successes, **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) probably ranks as one of the most surprising. But Macy's stock demonstrates why our focus remains on pullbacks of strong stocks rather than breakouts, especially with the challenges of sector rotation.




Swing Trading Example: Macy's Stock
-----------------------------------


As earnings season gets into full swing, it's worth noting that big moves often come with second chances. Take Macy's stock. It saw nearly a 20% gain after its last earnings report **(1)**. While it went higher, over the next few days, it also provided another opportunity for entry after its 14% pullback **(2)**.


Macy's stock joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) after it broke above its downtrend and moved back above its short-term moving average lines **(3)**. The Nasdaq composite at the time also looked like it was getting support at its [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), so we looked at increasing exposure at the time.


But while the Nasdaq's bounce failed and ended up going lower, Macy's stock held up relatively well **(4)**. It found support again at its 21-day line while the Nasdaq composite fell below its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). That kind of strength often shows up in the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) and gave us good reason to keep the stock.


Sector Rotation Solidifies Taking Profits Into Strength
-------------------------------------------------------


One of the more challenging aspects of the stock market this year is sector rotation. The major market indexes have masked both strength and weaknesses in individual stocks and entire groups. The industry group for Macy's stock, retail-department stores, just dropped out of the top five groups the past week after months of leadership. One reason for its leadership role is that while many technology groups flattened out after February, the department stores kept climbing.


We saw that again as Macy's stock tacked on gains while the market pulled back at the end of September. This is another reason why [taking profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/why-we-took-profits-into-strength-on-stld-stock/) becomes more critical during sector rotation. It's often just a matter of time before the strong sector falls out of favor, replaced by another.


So we took our first third of profits after hitting a 5% gain **(5)**. Then another third came off once we had a 13% gain **(6)**. After six consecutive days of gains, Macy's stock finally had a down day **(7)**. Even that was fairly mild considering the Nasdaq composite undercut its Sept. 20 lows the same day.


But retail's time in the sun faded the next day after **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)) [reported its earnings and cited supply chain issues](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-in-correction-merck-covid-drug-rocks-moderna-biontech-weekly-review/). We exited Macy's stock early in the trading session at 23.42 before it dropped to a low of 22.33 that day **(8)**. It sliced below both its 5- and 10-day moving average lines.


Though it did get worse and eventually tested its 50-day moving average **(9)**, it held pretty tightly at its 21-day line. With sector rotation acting so quickly, it's often not long before out-of-favor sectors find themselves back in the sunlight again.

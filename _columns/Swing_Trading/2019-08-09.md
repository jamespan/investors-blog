This week saw the major stock market indexes plunge into a stock market correction. That's usually a time to sit out and wait for a better environment. But [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) can still offer opportunities for quick profits on short-term trades.




Stock Market Correction Sets Up
-------------------------------


A recent trade in the ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF ([QLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLD)) demonstrates that there are still ways to profit in a stock market correction. The Ultra QQQ offers a two-times leveraged position on the Nasdaq 100 index. That is, whatever the Nasdaq 100 does in a single day, expect QLD to double it. As you can see from the accompanying chart, the price action matches the market, just with bigger daily moves.


The tone of the market started with the last Fed meeting **(1)**. The quarter-point cut was expected. But Wall Street seemed to object to comments that quashed hopes for more aggressive cutting in the future. The stock market suffered a [distribution day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/), a sign of institutional selling. Market fears worsened the following day **(2)** on a tweet from President Donald Trump that a [tariff increase](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/what-is-a-tariff/) on Chinese imports would go into effect Sept. 1. Indexes regained a lot of ground earlier in the day but the selling pressure led to another distribution day.


Recognizing the shift in sentiment, [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) switched to "uptrend under pressure." It alerted readers that more trouble could be on the way. Though not far off its all-time highs, the increased institutional selling tends to lead to further weakness.


Swing Trading A Reversal
------------------------


Things did, in fact, worsen. Market indexes saw six consecutive days down, a slice through the 50-day moving average line, and even more signs of institutional selling **(3).** The Big Picture switched its outlook to stock market in correction. [The yuan hitting its weakest levels in a decade](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-got-dangerous-dow-jones-dives-as-yuan-breaks-key-level/) was the catalyst for the drop that day and what we call a ["vertical violation."](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-swing-trading/) This action usually requires more recovery time before position trades will be consistently successful again. But when things get overly negative, there is often a short-term swing trading opportunity with a bounce.


The stock market started an attempt on Aug. 6 but we really wanted to see a more powerful move above the previous day's high **(4)**. It looked better the next day as a weak start at the open turned into a strong close. The ProShares Ultra QQQ joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day **(5)** as a way to take advantage of a potential short-term bounce. It was a nice [upside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) with a wider trading range, a close near the peak and it cleared the highs of the previous two days. The extra leverage would give us gains more in line with a stock's movement and the stop loss would give us a measure of protection if the trade didn't work out.


Taking Profits And Raising The Stop
-----------------------------------


The next day's jump in QLD provided a good opportunity to lock in some profits **(6)**. The Nasdaq composite approached the 8000 level again and it's 50-day moving average line, two converging areas of potential resistance. We took half profits in the ProShares Ultra ETF and [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from out entry. The combination of taking some profits and raising the stop helps ensure we get out of the trade with a win. If this is a bottom with more room to run, we will still participate with our half position. The extra leverage will give us a greater return than the market if the strength continues.


We're still cautious because of the vertical violation. If we can eke out some profits in the meantime, while managing our risk, that can help a portfolio grow despite the stock market correction. Using a market-related ETF can also help keep you engaged a better primed for recognizing a market turn.

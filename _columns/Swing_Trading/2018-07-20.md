When gains evaporate in a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), you need to be wary of your emotions. It's easy to overlook a growing loss when all your focus is on the higher price where you could have sold your stock. But pay attention to warning signs for when to sell stocks. Not only can they protect you from a devastating loss, they can also help you cut a loss quicker, as **DocuSign**'s ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) stock demonstrates.




DocuSign had its initial public offering on April 27 **(1)** and piled on incredible gains over the next two months **(2)**. As is usually the case, a correction followed **(3)**. At just under 25% the drop might seem dramatic, but it's in line with normal behavior after such a big run.


A bounce off the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) on DocuSign stock set up a potential new buy as a swing trade **(4)**. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on July 12 as [volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) swelled to its highest level in the past eight days.


It's good practice to determine when to sell stocks at the time of entry with a [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/). In this case, the low of the day at 51.50 had a larger risk percentage than we usually allow. But there was an area of support and resistance at 52.50 on an intraday chart. Using that shaved some risk off.


Early Warning Signs For When To Sell Stocks
-------------------------------------------


After only a couple of days, we nearly reached our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-profits-early-is-a-key-tenet-of-swing-trades/). The stock opened up strongly, got within 20 cents of our first target and then backed away. By the market close, DocuSign stock was negative and trading near its lows **(5)**. [Bearish reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) often see weakness follow, acting as an early warning sign for when to sell stocks.


And weakness did follow. The next day the stock dropped below our entry but got support by the end of the day. Then things got worse. DocuSign shares dropped again, only this time the support didn't come. In fact, it was a decisive [close below the five-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) **(6)**. The five-day moving average is a useful swing trading indicator for when to sell stocks. It prompted DocuSign stock's exit at 53.54, a full point above the stop loss.


Using rules to determine when to sell stocks is essential to fighting emotions. Having a nice gain turn into a loss hurts. Waiting and hoping your stock comes back is the wrong answer. Rather than hoping to recapture gains, you should fear that things could get worse with a change in trend.


No matter how much your emotions may get out of whack or how much hope you might have, rules tell you when the odds have shifted. Even if the stock comes right back, rules applied over time will keep you out of a lot of trouble.

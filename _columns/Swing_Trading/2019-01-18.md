It might seem obvious but if you are going to build realized profits in your portfolio, you need to know when to sell a stock. The rules depend on what your profit targets are, as Planet Fitness stock demonstrates.




A [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) in **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) goes for the short-term gain. If you can get a 5% to 10% gain in a week or two, that's plenty. Do that often enough, while cutting losses short, and you can achieve an outstanding return. You can sell into strength as you reach profit targets. Or use short-term moving averages, like the 5- or 10-day moving averages, to gauge when to sell stock to protect your profits.


If you are looking more for a [position trade,](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sell-alibaba-stock-swing-trading-position-trading/) 20% or more might be your profit goal.


Swing Trade Example: Planet Fitness Stock
-----------------------------------------


As stocks recovered from the stock market correction last quarter, the setups have been sparse. Nevertheless, Planet Fitness stock caught our attention on Jan. 4 as it jumped above its 5-day moving average **(1)**. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day. Also, we switched our market action to uptrend when the S&P 500 staged a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/). Planet Fitness stock had heavier volume than average on its move and its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) was in new high territory **(1)**. We were also familiar with it since [Planet Fitness stock was a previous winner on SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) and previous member of [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/).

Since this was a swing trade, our first target was a 5% profit goal from our entry. That target nearly triggered two days later and [we took profits on half the position and raised our stop](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) **(2)**. It's a customary action we take by following rules on when to sell stock on the way up. Our next goal? See if we could get 10% on the remaining shares.


Planet Fitness nearly got there within a week of our entry **(3)**, just one point shy with over an 8% gain. But then it fell below the 5-day moving average line just a couple of days later **(4)**.


When To Sell Stock To Keep Swing Trade Profits
----------------------------------------------


We often [use the 5-day moving average to help tell us when to sell stock](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-average-lines-swing-trading-stock-profits/) and retain profits. We've noticed a decisive close below the 5-day moving average often leads to a breach below the 10-day moving average shortly after. Rather than risk losing the profits in Planet Fitness stock, we removed the remaining shares **(4)** at a price just above our first sell. The stock moved sideways the rest of the week, seeming to hit [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) around 58.50 **(5)**.


As a swing trade, we were happy to take the quick profits. Just under 5% in just over a week. The sideways action usually indicates a stock that needs time. A swing trader doesn't tend to allow that in trades. But a position trader might. A break above the sideways area could set up a rally that hits the 10% goal and beyond. The time frame and profit targets are big determiners of what rules you use on when to sell stock. Just make sure you aren't constantly changing strategies midstream to justify your reasons for breaking rules. That's a sign that emotions are ruling over your decision-making process.

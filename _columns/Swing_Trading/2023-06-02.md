In any game of chance you take any opportunity to put the odds in your favor. With [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), there is still an element of chance but those opportunities for an edge come more frequently. With DraftKings stock giving multiple chances this year for gains, it's been a bet worth taking more than once.




Swing Trading Example: DKNG Stock
---------------------------------


DraftKings ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) stock has already had three ventures on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) this year. [A previous column](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/draftkings-stock-left-with-gain-thanks-to-early-sell/) outlined its entry on the March follow-through day **(1)**.


Taking a third off into strength **(2)** helped keep the trade positive when it eventually exited after a 6% gain nearly had a round-trip **(3)**.


Thought the stock ended up coming back that day, DKNG stock fell further before it found support at its 50-day moving average line **(4)** and easily could have turned into a losing trade.


DraftKings stock ended up making a nice move without us, but a lot of that came from a 15% gain after its earnings report **(5)**. Since we don't hold through earnings, we can't very well bemoan missing these types of moves. If anything we can breathe a sigh of relief in the multiple cases where the stock goes the other way with big gaps down. Those types of losses can wipe out a lot of our small gains.


Another Chance And Another Gain
-------------------------------


Rather than ignore the stock after its big earnings move, we kept it on our radar for another potential chance. That came a couple weeks later when DraftKings stock bounced at its 21-day moving average line with accompanying volume **(6)**.


A similar story played out as we took a third of the position off once we hit a 6% gain on a strong gap up **(7)**. The profit taking helped relieve some pressure as DKNG stock fell well off its highs by the end of the day.

Again, we saw a healthy gain (this time to the tune of 11%) come all the way back to our entry and force our exit **(8)**. Also like our previous trade, the early exit saved us from further destruction of gains which easily could have turned the trade into a loss.


Can The Magic Continue?
-----------------------


Even after playing the stock twice, there isn't reason to think it might not run again. After another bounce from its 21-day moving average line DraftKings stock joined SwingTrader for its third time this year **(9)**.


It's a current trade on our SwingTrader product as of this writing and we've already taken our first third off with a 4% gain.


So what's our strategy going forward? No reason for alterations. We can give the remaining two-thirds room to grow. If we see an undercut of recent lows, like the entry day low, or a surrender of our current gains an exit can almost be assured.


If we get more gains, we might take another third if we close in on 10% gains or get extended from our moving averages. That could leave a final exit at a close below one of the short-term moving average lines or even further extension beyond the norms.


In either case, by sticking to a familiar playbook, we've helped ourselves to multiple winning trades in DraftKings stock.

People use volume in their voices to show intensity of emotion. Whether it's a raised voice in anger, fear, surprise or elation, volume is a key metric to gauge the level of the emotion. Volume in the markets (the amount of shares traded) is similar. It's your measure of the intensity of the buying or selling behind the price move.


Higher volume means more traders were clamoring to buy or sell the stock, or larger players were coming in with bigger orders. Traders need to keep a keen eye on volume in both the general market and for individual stocks, especially at critical areas of support and resistance.


The Nasdaq composite, as the leading index this year, has been key in guiding [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). Volume, especially at inflection points, has provided additional clues to enhance success. The Nasdaq made little progress in March and was especially shaken by a severe drop on March 21 **(1)**. Over the next month, a lot of sideways action followed, leading to reduced trading as the batting average suffered on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH).


Things improved on April 24 when the index gapped up on an increase in volume **(2)**. The batting average was over 80% wins in the next month for [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as that initial intensity at an inflection point fueled a number of positive setups.


On the downside, the market was dealt another blow on May 17 with a drop in heavier volume **(3)**.  A suspicious part of the recovery was that five consecutive days of gains also had consecutively lower volume **(4)**. That makes you wonder why there wasn't more intensity behind the buying. During those five days, two stocks were put on the SwingTrader watch list: **Southwest Airlines** ([LUV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LUV)) and **Berry Global Group** ([BERY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BERY)). Both were removed without triggering buys. The reason? No volume as they passed their buy points. While both pushed higher, why risk hard-earned money on a low-probability trade in an iffy environment?


To the market's favor, May 25 saw volume come in heavier than the previous day for the first time in the rebound **(5)**. There are, however, a few key differences to note when comparing this day to the strength of April 24 **(2)**. First, the small-cap Russell 2000 beat the Nasdaq with an even higher jump on April 24. On May 25, the Russell was up, but grudgingly. It closed up, just barely, and low in its trading range. Second, the action the following day was very different. April 24 was immediately followed by another strong day on even better volume, a key of that rally's success. Friday's action showed an inside day with volume tapering off. Of course, the looming Memorial Day holiday could be blamed for a lack of action, but it still leaves the question: If there isn't any intensity behind the buying, how much progress can we make?

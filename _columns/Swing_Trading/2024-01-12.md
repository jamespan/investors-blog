Last year was focused on the "Magnificent Seven" stocks as many investors bemoaned the difficulty of keeping up with market-weighted indexes dominated by the megacap companies. But at the end of 2023, market breadth improved. That's shifted some of the focus for swing trading.




A Tale Of Two ETFs
------------------


Software has certainly been an area of interest for a while and according to [IBD's 197 Industry Groups](https://www.investors.com/data-tables/industry-group-rankings-jan-11-2024/), a number of computer software groups made themselves comfortable in the top ranks in 2023.


When focusing on software, we often look to the iShares Expanded Tech Software Sector ETF ([IGV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IGV)). It's packed with heavyweights in software and goes for "targeted" exposure. The top five holdings have a roughly 40% weight for the ETF.


The SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF ([XSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XSW)) is a different animal. It belongs to the **State Street** ([STT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STT)) family and [according to the State Street website](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-software-services-etf-xsw) uses a "modified equal weighted index" in order to provide "unconcentrated industry exposure." None of its holdings even surpass 1% of the fund so the top five holdings don't even reach a 5% weight of the total ETF.


In other words, breadth matters and is a distinguishing factor between the two ETFs. At the time of the Nov. 1 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), XSW wasn't flexing its muscles yet as market breadth was still struggling **(1)**. Since relative strength is a critical component of swing trading, it wasn't ready for prime time yet.


But just a couple of weeks later and a gap-up put the ETF some distance above its moving average lines **(2)**.Â After taking a breather, XSW gapped up again with a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) confirming the strength **(3)**. It joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day.


Swing Trading Software Broadly
------------------------------


One of the easiest ways to confirm a correct swing trading decision is that it immediately starts working. XSW provided that immediate feedback and in just a couple of days we took off our first third of the position after seeing a 2.5% gain **(4)**.

As the ETF digested its gains, it found support at its 10-day moving average **(5)** before taking off again. We used that pop to take another third off in profits **(6)** and looked to give the remaining position room to run.


For the most part, XSW held its 5-day moving average as it continued higher with a brief breach along the way **(7)**. But at the end of the year, it fell below both its 5- and 10-day lines **(8)**. In the past XSW would quickly find support after stumbling. But this time, it stumbled further as the new year started **(9)**. That led to its swing trading exit.


But that might not be the end of the story. Market breadth took a turn lower to start 2024 and still has some recovery to do despite recent bounces in indexes. If market breadth does return, XSW may provide another swing trading opportunity.

We saw some weakness hit the stock market at the end of the week. It's not necessarily an omen for a full-blown stock market correction but that doesn't mean you can't play some defense in your swing trading. As a starting point, protecting profits while you have them naturally reduces exposure ahead of a stock market correction or even a mild pullback. Following some simple rules helps the whole process.




When you hit your first price target quickly in a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), you need to remain objective and unemotional. The first reaction might be to congratulate yourself on your skill. Or you might start calculating how much money you'll make if the trend continues. But in your elation, don't forget to take rules-based steps to protect the profit you have. A quick move up can fall back to Earth just as quickly. Or a stock market correction could put pressure on your whole portfolio. By raising your stop-loss as you go along, you protect profits and prevent a good trade from going bad.


From the beginning of our [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) launch in 2016, we've always tried to keep profits when we have them. We applied our rules most recently with **Essent Group** ([ESNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ESNT)). The mortgage insurer joined SwingTrader on March 18 as it [broke out](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/breakouts-buying-stocks-swing-trades/) of a short one-month consolidation **(1)**. Essent's previous resistance was at 45.06 and we added it at 45.66. Also notable was the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) making new highs **(1)** and [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-clues-complement-price-action-for-stocks/) tracking well above average and the highest of the entire consolidation **(1)**.


When To Sell Stocks: Hit The Price Target, Raise The Stop-Loss
--------------------------------------------------------------


The next day, Essent stock hit its 5% profit goal early in the trading day **(2)**. At this point, we usually take at least some profits. This allows us to still participate if the stock continues to make progress after such a strong start. If it's just a temporary surge, however, we've locked in some solid gains in case the stock falls just as quickly.


Protecting the profit on the remaining shares is just as important. To do that, you simply raise your stop. We usually choose a raised stop at 1% profit from our entry after hitting the 5% profit goal. That prevents a stock from going negative on you and will usually let you exit with at least a 3% gain for the entire trade.


For Essent, we took half profits at 47.93 and moved our original stop loss from 44.36 up to 46.12. Basically, if we are going to take a drawdown, why not cut the loss in half rather than take the full 7.5% off the top? This rule is automatic but you'll often find it very prescient.


Protection From A Stock Market Correction Or Pullback
-----------------------------------------------------


Essent immediately flashed a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(2)** right after reaching the 5% profit goal. It closed at the bottom of its trading range and put us on notice that there might be more weakness ahead. The next day triggered the raised stop-loss **(3)**. No thinking required at that point because you have a rule in place.


This was just another case where [the raised stop-loss saved you from a steeper fall.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) Through the end of the week, Essent dropped another 6% from our second exit and was down nearly 10% from our first exit. We also took full profits on a few of our other positions as the stock market got extended. It left us with little exposure when the market weakness hit on Friday. So whether the stock market is experiencing another mild pullback or something more serious, we took the profits that we could.


We didn't necessarily sell at the top in all cases, like our first exit in Essent. But we didn't get hurt much as the stock market fell. Individual sell rules often push you out of harm's way. It also keeps your powder dry for the next swing trade opportunities.

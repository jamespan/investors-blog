After getting even more extended this week, the market finally took the breather we were waiting for. It was just steeper than expected. Still, by following [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) principles, we managed to avoid most of the carnage. Just one example is selling Mastercard stock into strength.




Swing Trading Example: Mastercard Stock
---------------------------------------


**Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) has a number of reasons to be on our radar. As a founding member of [IBD's Long-Term Leaders List](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/), it has the strong fundamentals along with a history of outperformance over the market. But what about as a swing trade?


Mastercard stock broke out of a base on Aug. 5 after consolidating while the market heated up **(1)**. A few days pulling back and it was back at recent highs and joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(2)**near its highs for the day.


Admittedly, the close at the end of the day wasn't great for MA stock. It pulled back for a few days **(3)** but never closed decisively below the 5- or 10-day moving averages. Mastercard also remained above the entry day low. Having these lines in the sand can give you an early indicator when a trade isn't working out. That allows you to [cut your loss short](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategies-cutting-losses/) rather than letting it grow.

Taking Profits Into Strength
----------------------------


Though a slow starter, MA stock started to pick up the pace. More than a week into the trade, we started taking profits into strength. First we took a third of our profits up 2.5% from our entry **(4)**. Then we took another third when we were up 4% from our entry **(5)**. It's a little quick to take that much off but, given the average moves in Mastercard stock, it seemed appropriate.


A benefit to the early profit taking is that you can [give a stock room to run after that](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sq-stock-taking-early-profits-made-holding-easier/). If it corrects, the smaller position size won't hurt your portfolio as much. The downside of course is the opportunity cost. A big move will be less meaningful with a smaller position size. Due to the market getting extended, we were already using [smaller position sizes](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-adjustments-temper-swing-trading-risk/).


A Timely Exit
-------------


After our second exit, MA stock started to accelerate its pace. Its weekly gain was much larger than usual for the stock as the angle of ascent steepened. It looked unsustainable, given Mastercard's long history of measured moves. With the market also showing signs of getting extended, we took the remaining position off near the highs **(6)**.


It may seem counterintuitive to sell when a stock is doing nothing wrong and just going up. But regular selling into strength frees up capital for the next trade. Should no trades present themselves, that tells you something as well. The market is vulnerable.


After a quick move down to the 5-day moving average line, Mastercard stock looked like it might get support **(7)**. But this market pullback left few survivors and a break below the 10-day line on Thursday **(8)** only got worse on Friday.


Selling into strength avoided the pullback of 10%. Not only that, the preserved capital is available to take advantage of new opportunities which will undoubtedly present themselves when the market finds support.

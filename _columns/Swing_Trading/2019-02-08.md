Deciding when to sell stocks is a struggle. Even when a stock is doing well. Sell too early and you miss gains. Sell too late and you miss profits. Here's how we handled a recent [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) in **Medpace** ([MEDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MEDP)) stock to illustrate the point.




Swing Trading Example: Medpace Stock
------------------------------------


The question of when to sell stocks begins with another question. Where did you buy the stock? Buying right solves a lot of problems investors have with selling.


Medpace found its way onto IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) three times in the last few months. First, an early entry in August delivered a quick profit. Then, as the stock market rebounded after the Christmas holiday, it offered a strong [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) **(1)**. It was a half position to test the waters in the early stock market rebound. The stock market did advance strongly but Medpace was slow to start. [We took a small loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-position-test-trade-reduces-risk/) after the stock failed to follow-through on its reversal after a week's time **(2)**.


Medpace Stock Revisited
-----------------------


However, a few things kept Medpace stock on our radar. One of the most important was its relative strength. While many stocks were well below their 50- and 200-day moving averages, Medpace only briefly pierced below its 200-day line. It was also one of the first stocks above its 50-day line. While the stock market paused at the end of January, Medpace held tight and joined the SwingTrader [watch list](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/watch-list-keeps-you-engaged-in-tough-markets/) on Jan. 29 **(3)**.


The next day, the stock market tested prior [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) and Medpace stock showed leadership by [breaking above its resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) levels **(4)**. At the same time, volume swelled and its relative strength line hit new ground **(4)**. In just a couple of days we already hit our first profit goal of 5% and took half profits **(5)**. Having rules and profit goals helps tremendously with deciding when to sell stocks. But when Medpace reached its 10% profit goal a couple of days later **(6)**, the decision wasn't as easy.


When To Sell Stocks And Nail Down Profits
-----------------------------------------


Whenever a stock hits its profit goals quickly, the strength suggests power that may continue. Our swing trading entry also corresponded to a justifiable breakout entry for [position traders.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sell-alibaba-stock-swing-trading-position-trading/) That influenced the decision to try and extend the gains. The fear? The major stock market indexes were just below their 200-day moving averages. Resistance levels in the stock market could easily put a halt to the advance of individual stocks. Shortly after hitting its 10% profit goal, Medpace stock showed a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(6)**. It closed above where we took half profits but in the bottom of its trading range. Having cushion gave us more leeway with our sell decision. The potential for further profits outweighed the risk of losing some of the profits already earned. It's an example of how buying right helps with your decision on when to sell stocks.


With the warning shot from the bearish reversal, we decided to see how the next day played out. When Medpace fell back to the level of our original profit taking, we removed the remaining position. Even though the decision to hold didn't work out in our favor, we didn't come away empty-handed. The total trade yielded more than 5% in just over a week.

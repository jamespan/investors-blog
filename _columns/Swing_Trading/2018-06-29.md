Cutting losses quickly is critical to success in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). You must have a set stop loss and the discipline to act if it hits. With [China trade war](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-trade-war-trump-export-controls-chip-equipment/) headlines jostling stocks, you need to know where to put your stop loss for the protection it provides.




**Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) had a lot to offer as a swing trade opportunity. It's a member of the computer enterprise software group, one of the top-performing groups of this year. Its last earnings report acted as a catalyst for a strong [breakout](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) **(1),** vaulting 20% move in the next few weeks. Rather than fretting over the missed opportunity in Baozun's move, you can look for a new opportunity in a pullback. In this case, a bullish [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) presented itself as the stock fell below 60 then powered back above it in a single day **(2)**.


Typically in a reversal, we look for the price to surpass the previous day's close to confirm the strength. The reversal day fell short in that regard. But the next day, the stock opened above the reversal day high and started making progress early in the trading day **(3)**. Baozun joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at an early entry of 62.36. But before entering a trade, you need to determine where to put your stop loss.


Setting A Proper Stop Loss
--------------------------


For reversals, we often look to the low of the reversal day as our stop loss. In this case, that would amount to an excessive risk for a swing trade at nearly 10%. Using the low of the entry day would normally be an acceptable alternative, but that was too tight.


There seemed to be an area of support around 60 from a few weeks back on the daily chart and this matched up nicely with an area of support on the intraday chart. At over a 3% risk percentage it was on the higher side but still reasonable. You could also reduce the risk to your portfolio by adjusting your position size.


Two days later, short-term market conditions worsened and Baozun hit our stop loss **(4)**. It's not fun taking a loss, but it is a part of trading. Sure, by the end of the day the stock was above our stop loss but you don't know if it will come back when your stop loss triggers. You have to protect yourself from the loss potentially growing.


The China trade war rhetoric continued the next week and Baozun fell 10% the day after we removed it from SwingTrader. It continued falling throughout the week. If you don't respect your stop loss, you set yourself up for devastating losses.


It's bad enough that you reduce the capital in your portfolio. It means starting with less money for your next opportunity. But even worse is what a large loss can do to your emotional capital. You can get more timid at the next move, investing less or investing late. That's the hidden cost of big losses. Cut losses short, respect your stop losses and it will save you from a lot of costly mistakes.

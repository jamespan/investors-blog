Selling early is a lot better than selling late, especially with the short-term nature of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). An early indicator of a stock's trend change is the short-term moving average lines. Used properly, they can help you keep profits and reduce losses.


Use Short-Term Moving Average As Swing Trading Sell Signal
----------------------------------------------------------


Of course selling often comes with emotions. If you sell too early, you fear the stock may turn right around to make gains without you. If you sell too late, you risk the possibility of losing even more profits or having the trade go negative. That's where rules come in to combat the emotions. A simple rule in swing trading is to sell if you see a decisive close below a short-term moving average line. We've used the 5-day moving average line most recently, but for some market environments the [10-day moving average line would be more appropriate](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/). Using this sell rule allows for an objective and consistent strategy to handle the decision unemotionally.


Since the 5-day average hugs the price tightly, it is usually in your best interest to wait for a decisive close below the line before taking action. If the stock punctures the line intraday but shows signs of support by the end of the day, you can wait to sell. That show of support suggests the stock was able to overcome selling pressure. Even if the close is just slightly below it, you can still hold the stock. Especially if it clearly rebounded from its lows.


Swing Trading Example: Autodesk Stock
-------------------------------------


When **Autodesk** ([ADSK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADSK)) jumped 15% immediately after its August earnings report **(1)**, it retained the bulk of its gains during its pullback **(2)**. That sign of strength on a fundamentally sound company gets us looking for a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/). On Sept. 20, Autodesk cleared [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) and joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH)at 152.91 **(3)**. The move also put Autodesk stock well above its 5- and 10-day moving average lines.


The stock faltered a little at first. It nearly took out its [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) at the entry day low before showing another positive reversal **(4)**. Though it broke below its 5- and 10-day moving average lines intraday, our rule to wait until the close proved useful. The area around 150 seemed to provide support and the stock bounced from there.


A few days later Autodesk stock was on its way to our [first price target at 5%](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/) but topped out with just a 2.7% profit **(5)**. After a mildly [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/), the stock hovered around 157 a few days before showing a decisive close below its 5-day moving average line **(6)**. Using our moving average sell rule allowed us to retain a small profit in the swing trade. This sell rule pushed us out of Autodesk stock before a 20% fall. Using sell rules in other stocks, we were [completely out of the market on Oct. 4](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-bearish-market-outlook/) and avoided the recent destruction in the major indexes.

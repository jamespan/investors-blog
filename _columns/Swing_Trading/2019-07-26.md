Losses are just a fact of life in swing trading. But cutting a loss early is key to keeping the upward progress in your portfolio. Bearish reversals can be one of those early signs that can warn you when a swing trade may falter. That was the case recently with Baozun stock.




Swing Trading Example: Baozun Stock
-----------------------------------


Chinese stocks have been challenging to play with the headline risk of the China trade war. Between lulls in the headlines, however, there have been some opportunities. **Baozun** ([BZUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BZUN)) looked like it was setting up another shot as it [gapped up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) an impressive 7.5% at the beginning of July **(1)**. It cleared an area of [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) at 50 and then consolidated the gains in sideways action.


We added Baozun stock to IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as it crossed its early July high **(2)**. The short two-week consolidation kept all the gains from the gap and held tight. Things looked good at the start and we had nearly a 2% gain fairly quickly. But then a headline turned the tide. President Donald Trump answered a reporter's question with [frustration over the status of trade war talks with China](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/major-stock-indexes-off-after-trump-trade-remarks-bank-earnings-shine/). Almost immediately, Baozun stock started falling. The result? A classic [bearish reversal day](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/).


Bearish Reversal Defined
------------------------


A bearish reversal occurs when a strong start to the day ends near the session lows, giving back impressive gains. After the stock runs up, whether profit taking or news hits it, you find that investors have no appetite for the stock at the higher price. An increase in [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/), as seen with Baozun stock **(2)**, is further proof that the sellers are in control.


In this case, the selling triggered our stop loss as it undercut the day's lows. Even if we had room above our [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/when-to-sell-stocks-docusign-stock/), it would be difficult to have much confidence in a stock with such an ugly reversal on its chart. Action following a bearish reversal tends to be weak or at best flat. Unless you get an overwhelming amount of strength to offset the selling (say with an optimistic headline), your prospects for gains are diminished.


Bearish Reversal Was Just The Beginning
---------------------------------------


Things got worse for Baozun stock over the next few days. It fell another 10% from our exit before staging a rally starting on July 18 **(3)**. Notice as the rally continued, volume drifted lower **(4)**. Again, the chart shows little appetite for Baozun stock at a price much above 50. On July 25, selling came in hard again **(5)**. A single day wiped out the solid gains of the prior four days with a 7.7% drop.


The bearish reversal gave an early warning that progress would be difficult. Heeding the warning avoided a potentially larger swing trading loss.

The [oil stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-gas-stocks-industry-news-oil-prices-opec-exxon-haliburton-schlumberger-chevron-continental-resources/) have been one of the standout areas of the year. But some of the stocks haven't given many chances for low-risk [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) entries. When CPE stock showed these relative strength clues, we took advantage of the opportunity.




What Made CPE Stock Different Among Oil Stocks?
-----------------------------------------------


Relative strength comes in different forms but one key indicator to look at is the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). When **Callon Petroleum** ([CPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPE)) broke out at the beginning of June **(1)**, the relative strength line at new highs **(2)** was a clear sign of leadership.


And while many oil stocks broke out at the same time, CPE stock set itself apart with a 30% move in just a matter of days **(3)**. Rather than bemoan a stock missed, that kind of power should make you want to keep a stock on your radar. It's another form of relative strength.

When oil stocks plunged on June 17, most of them undercut their lows of the past couple of weeks. CPE stock was different. It found support at the lows of the previous couple of weeks and resisted giving up gains **(4)**. If you guessed that was another relative strength clue, you were right. Be aware when a stock doesn't come down as much as the market or its peers. It's worth looking at the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explorers ETF ([XOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOP)) for comparison purposes.



Two days later, oil stocks were showing a comeback. But here again CPE stock was different. Whereas, many oil stocks were recovering only half the ground lost on June 17, or less, CPE stock was easily surpassing it **(5)**. Shaking weakness off quickly and returning to new highs is another sign of relative strength and landed CPE stock on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day. Notably, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) was right back at new highs **(6)**.


Locking In Profits
------------------


It's unusual but CPE stock was so strong, we ended up taking our first third of profits on the entry day **(5)**. By the end of the day, we already had over a 5% profit and it's always good to lock some in on strength.


But CPE stock didn't stop there. It continued to outperform among the oil stocks and we took another round of gains at around 15% **(7)**. With a good portion of profit locked in, we have the flexibility to give stocks room.


When oil stocks took another hit on June 28, CPE stock reacted in a similar fashion **(8)**. And although it was getting potential support at the [10-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-averages-can-help-lock-in-stock-profits/) we decided to lock in the profit that we had. CPE stock undercut the lows of the prior three days and a [production meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries](https://www.investors.com/news/oil-prices-opec-meeting-production-quotas-july-2021/) scheduled for the end of the week added an uncertainty for oil stocks.


While CPE stock did recover back to new highs **(9)**, it does seem to be hitting resistance at 60. But the lessons of relative strength clues can be used to find another big winner.

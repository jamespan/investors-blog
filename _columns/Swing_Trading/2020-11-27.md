Selling profitable [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) positions isn't easy. There is always the possibility that you take profits too early and the stock moves higher without you. A recent trade in TSM stock shows some of the factors to consider.




Setups In Semiconductor Sector
------------------------------


No question, [semiconductor stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chip-stocks-and-semiconductor-industry-news) have been one of leaders in this past month. That's been good for **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) as it makes the chips designed by others. The pullback in October provided ample trading opportunities in November as many leading stocks got support at moving averages or [broke above trendlines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/looking-for-an-earlier-entry-in-a-stock-learn-how-to-do-this/).


In the case of TSM stock, that bounce off the 50-day moving average on Nov. 2 was the chance to put it on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(1)**. Notably, the pullback in TSM stock was milder than the market indexes. That led to a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) that also held up well and was near highs on our entry **(1)**.


Early Profit Taking Makes An Easier Hold
----------------------------------------


We took some profits early in TSM stock. Our first third came off after a 2.5% gain **(2)** from our entry and the second third came off after a 6% gain **(3)**. It's part of our approach to sell into strength. While it means less exposure should the stock really take off, it also reduces risk and helps keep a trade profitable should the stock reverse lower.

Nov. 9 saw a lot of rotation on [coronavirus vaccine news](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) and TSM stock, like many other stocks that day, saw an outside day that closed at its lows **(4)**. A lot of adjustments needed to be made to our portfolio on SwingTrader, but Taiwan Semiconductor remained. We still had the bulk of our gains and the early profit taking gave us less risk should the stock fall.


The next day, TSM stock closed well below its 5-day moving average line **(5)** but the cushion we had and smaller position size allowed us to use the 10-day moving average line. That line seemed to provide strong support.


That patience paid off as tech found its footing and came on strong with TSM stock quickly getting back to new highs with our position intact **(6)**.


Again, the early profit taking also has its downside. When TSM stock saw a strong gap-up **(7)**, the smaller position size meant less impact on overall performance. But without the early profit taking, we might not have been able to hold through the earlier weakness at all.


Exiting TSM Stock
-----------------


While the gap-up might have spurred dreams of further gains, it can also be a sign it's time to part company. When TSM stock closed below the low of the gap-up day **(8)**, we still had more than a 10% cushion from our initial entry. A couple days later we exited the remaining position **(9)**. Our alert to subscribers noted that TSM stock looked like it needed more time to consolidate from the gap-up.


While it was an appropriate swing trading exit, we also mentioned that it could be held as a position trade. With that much cushion on the initial entry, you could give the stock room should you want to expand your holding time horizon. It's a legitimate strategy when you have a winner. But you don't want to make such a shift in strategy when you have a loser. Trying to give yourself more time in that case is usually a way to avoid admitting a mistake.

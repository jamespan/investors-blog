Whether [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) or any other type of trading, you always want to have a clearly defined exit strategy. Setting a stop loss is critical at the outset but can differ in its execution. Here's how we handled a recent trade on a gap-down through a stop loss.




Should You Use A Stop Loss Order?
---------------------------------


The purpose of a stop loss is pretty straightforward. It's to stop your losses from growing larger. After all, the best way to avoid taking big losses is by taking small losses. One way to execute that is with a stop loss order.


A stop loss order can be put in with your broker and you can set the price of your stop. If your stock trades below that price, your broker will automatically put in the sell order for you. This can be useful for two reasons. First, it forces you to be disciplined. You make the decision ahead of time, and if the stock triggers the stop price the order is executed. There's no risk of hesitation with your finger on the sell button hoping the stock comes back. Second, if you aren't always available during market hours, you don't run the risk of getting caught unaware by price action going against you.

Another way to approach your stop loss is by setting an alert and then analyzing the action as it happens.


Swing Trading Strategy With A Stop Loss
---------------------------------------


When you see stocks gapping down at the open, an alert to draw your attention can be useful over a stop loss order. On [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), we faced this dilemma on a few swing trading positions Thursday, including the ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF ([SSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSO)). This ETF tracks the S&P 500 but seeks to double the daily performance, whether on the upside or downside.


We set our stop loss for SSO as a *close* below the Sept. 14 low at 73.99. We will often put a close below a certain level as a swing trading stop loss because it gives us the flexibility to carefully analyze the action throughout the trading day.


Thursday morning, SSO gapped below our stop loss at the open **(1)**. But the 10-minute intraday chart shows the ETF made a stand by trying to recover on the very next 10-minute bar **(2)**. By waiting to see how the first few minutes trade, you can get a sense of direction. Is the gap-down attracting buyers or is it feeding more selling? You might still be selling the position below your stop loss, but maybe you can get out at a better price.


A New Line In The Sand
----------------------


As the recovery continued, it started a slight retracement **(3)**. If the retracement is enough and it holds for a while, this can offer a new line in the sand for exiting a position. Our SSO position eventually made it back above our stop loss price **(4)**, but not for long.


As the market started pulling back to its lows, it punctured the level of support from the first hour of trading **(5)** and exited SwingTrader shortly after. It was a better exit than waiting for the ETF to fall to new lows for the day **(6)**. It tested that same level again a few hours later **(7)**.


While it closed at a higher level than our exit **(8)**, it still ended up below our stop loss price. We used the intraday observation to make an intelligent assessment of when the risks of a bigger loss become greater than the likelihood of a better exit price.

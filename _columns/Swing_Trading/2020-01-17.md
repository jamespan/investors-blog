While [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) usually focuses on small gains, you also need rules when the unexpected large gain comes your way. We faced that decision on SwingTrader when Cardyltics stock burst more than 20% in a day.


It's a good problem to have. Do you book profits after getting an unexpected gift or do you hold out for even more?


Swing Trading Example: Cardlytics Stock
---------------------------------------


**Cardlytics** ([CDLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CDLX)) doesn't have much of an earnings growth record but it has potential. Its platform brings machine learning and big data algorithms to marketers, and the revenue growth shows interest for its software. The last earnings report saw Cardlytics stock surge 43% in a single day as it turned a profit **(1)**. What stood out about the huge gain is how well Cardlytics held the gains. It formed a four-week consolidation at the end of the year and offered a line of resistance **(2)** at 65.25.


We put Cardlytics stock on the watchlist for [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(3)** with that line in the sand as our trigger. The next day, it broke out to a new high and we put it on as a current trade at 65.97 **(4)**. The relative strength line confirmed the move as it reached new highs along with the stock price **(5)**.


We had profits by the end of the day and hit our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) in Cardlytics stock just a couple days later **(6)**. One of the swing trading strategies we employ regularly is to take half profits at 5% and raise our stop to 1% profit. It helps ensure that we keep a trade profitable and we found no reason to veer from that course of action.


On Jan. 13, Cardlytics presented at an investor conference. Before the presentation, [Cardlytics announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2019](https://ir.cardlytics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cardlytics-announces-preliminary-fourth-quarter-2019-financial). They showed a big beat on the revenue estimates and Cardlytics stock soared in the premarket. It opened up with a 10% gain from the previous day's close **(7)**. We sent an alert to subscribers at the open that we would give the stock more room to run. Even though the focus of swing trading is on small gains, we aren't going to turn away from big gains when we have them.


What Do You Do With A 20% Move In A Day?
----------------------------------------


A half-hour into the trading session and we were up 20% for the day in Cardlytics stock. It also looked like the rapid rise was slowing down and potentially pulling back. We decided to exit at 81.75 to book the remainder of our swing trading profit. Going into the decision, you must realize that your chances of selling at the top tick are not high. In this case, the stock made further gains later in the day and the next **(8)**, meaning we missed out on potentially another 10%.


While it is easy to focus on the fear of missing out on more gains, it's also important not to let greed rule your decision making. In fact, we just experienced a similar swing trading gain with a huge rise in **Crspr Therapeutics** ([CRSP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRSP)). [Crspr stock was on SwingTrader back in November](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/crispr-therapeutics-stock-surged-when-to-sell/). Holding Crspr just two days after our exit would have squandered all the gains of a 17% move in one day.


For Cardlytics stock, it was 10% off its high the next day and below our exit at the lows and continued to hover around our exit the next day as well **(9)**. We might not have nailed to top, but missing it by hours is still pretty good.

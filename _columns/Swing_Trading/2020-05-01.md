You would think that sidestepping the bear market means you get to pat yourself on the back and take it easy. Not so fast. If you sit out too long, all your outperformance can be whittled away by a strong stock market rally. We used a position in Invesco QQQ ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) to make sure we didn't get left behind.




QQQ And The Search For Exposure
-------------------------------


April was a strong month for the stock market. In the history of the Nasdaq composite, the 15.4% gain came in as the sixth highest. It's a monthly performance not seen since June 2000. But it wasn't easy to participate.


Looking at QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, can give you a good sense of the stock market action. It bottomed on March 23 as [coronavirus fears](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) took their toll on investors **(1)**. But we saw a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) **(2)** in the S&P 500 on April 2. It was an early indicator that a trend change was underway. But the day still seemed tentative.

When the Nasdaq composite staged its own follow-through day April 6, there was a better sense of power **(3)** with a strong close above the 21-day moving average line. We added a position in QQQ on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) to start rebuilding exposure. That might seem late at 17% off the bottom, but considering [we avoided most of the 30%+ correction](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-swing-trading-performance/), we had a lot of outperformance cushion.


Bear Market Recovery
--------------------


In retrospect, a mistake we made was keeping too tight a stop on the QQQ trade. As a diversified ETF, it deserved some more room. We took some early profits quickly that first week. First a downside reversal spooked us and we removed a portion expecting weakness to follow **(4)**. Then going into a three-day weekend, we unloaded some more **(5)**. The fear of potential negative headlines seemed like too high a risk and so we [retreated ahead of the weekend](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-fears-spark-another-weekend-retreat/). As QQQ rose above its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) **(6)**, the strong performance we enjoyed during the bear market recovery was unfortunately in a lightened position.


The gains continued until April 21 when QQQ sliced through its [10-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) **(7)**. It also undercut the low of the gap above the 50-day **(6)**. We removed the remaining position as a defensive measure. As mentioned in the [Weekend Stock Market Update](https://www.investors.com/research/stock-market-update-handle-on-coronavirus-bull-market/), it had the feel of algorithm-induced selling. Our goal was to give QQQ more room. But our expectation was for weakness to continue. If you let something go too far, you step out of the realm of swing trading.


Staying Flexible With A QQQ Buyback
-----------------------------------


The next day, the bear market recovery continued as if the sell-off never happened **(8)**. It was a [positive expectation breaker.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-expectation-breakers-what-to-do-when-stock-market-throws-you-curveball/) We put QQQ back on SwingTrader as it crossed the highs of the previous day. Sure, it was at a higher price than where we sold. But as much as we want to protect ourselves from losses, we also face the risk of not participating in a bear market recovery. And [as shown with our trade in **Netflix**](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/third-time-was-a-charm-for-netflix-stock/) ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), sometimes you have to pay a higher price on the buyback or you'll miss many opportunities.


That's not to say the position is without challenges. This week we had another sharp sell-off on April 28, but the break below the 10-day line was slight **(9)**. Like the week before, the stock market bounced right back the next day with another positive expectation breaker **(10)**. This time, we held the full QQQ position. Of course, only time will tell how this decision turns out. Should the market sell-off continue, the bad news is we'll suffer along with it. If we move higher, the good news is we won't be left behind.

  Half Positions Are Not Signs Of Commitment Issues

In "The Karate Kid," karate master Mr. Miyagi warned of being wishy-washy in commitment. He warned that walking on either side of the road was fine, but walking in the middle gets you "squished like grape."


Commitment to learning swing trading is laudable. And the lack of commitment is potentially perilous. But the financial commitment to any one trade should be tempered at times. Establishing a half position in a stock for a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) shouldn't be viewed as a lack of commitment. It's a calculation of risk based on how things can go right, or wrong, with an individual trade.


Take **Momo** ([MOMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOMO)), an addition to IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) last week. It had a strong move at the open Feb. 8 after Jeffries initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating **(1)**. In the first hour, it was up over 6%. Normally, an undercut of the [breakout](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787) low would be used as the stop loss, in this case 22.82. When entering something that has already moved up that quickly, that can be problematic. A 5.9% risk is a bigger hit than you typically want for a swing trade. That leaves your decision to either pass up the trade or make adjustments to help minimize risk.


A [recent column](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/protecting-your-portfolio-with-position-size/) on position size focused on mitigating risk to your portfolio. You have two levers at your disposal to mitigate risk: You either adjust your risk on the trade — the stop loss — or adjust your position size. On SwingTrader, we went with a half position on Momo, adding it after the first hour with an entry of 24.25. By the end of the day, it closed at 24.99, up 3.1% from the entry and 9.8% for the day.


What if we had adjusted the stop loss? Deciding the right level can be tricky. If you make it too tight, you run the risk of getting shaken out in a normal pullback. For a stock that has gone up so sharply, you have to be prepared for some type of drop. The quick profits are just too enticing for some to resist taking money off the table, which can knock a stock down a bit. Cutting the stop loss in half, to 23.52 or a 3% risk from the entry, might not have given enough room for the stock to withstand profit taking.


In fact, that level was nearly challenged Feb. 10 with a quick shakeout in the first 10 minutes of trading **(2)**. The half position allowed for the stock to be given room while protecting your portfolio.


On the downside, we stand to make less profit if this trade works out. That was an acceptable trade-off, especially as the market was showing more failures in the past couple weeks as the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 were consolidating. The half position also allows you to test the waters again when recovering from losses.

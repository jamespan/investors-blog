Most [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) last a few days to a few weeks. So it's easy to get fixated on daily and intraday charts. But sometimes taking a step back to weekly charts can give you a fresh and profitable perspective.




A weekly chart can reveal older areas of resistance that could otherwise be overlooked. Why does this matter? If you have a stock setting up for a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/), you are looking for it to clear an area of resistance. You assume it will have clear sailing once it crosses that resistance decisively. An older area of resistance, however, can impede that expected progress. It's like a roadblock thwarting your plan for a quick profit in five to 10 days.


Insights into a stock's personality are also exposed with a weekly chart. Take the [three-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) pattern. For the position trader, the pattern is usually viewed as a sign of quiet accumulation that bodes well for a stock's long-term prospects.


However, if a weekly chart shows a lot of three-weeks-tight patterns, that stock isn't right for a swing trade. A position trader can hold through those three-week periods and even add to his position after it breaks higher. With a horizon of a few months for the trade, that is acceptable. The swing trader, looking to hold for just a couple weeks, can't waste time on a stock that isn't moving.


A weekly chart also can show how a stock tends to make its move. If a stock rallies 50% over a year, it will probably have a decent Relative Strength Rating. But look at how much of the movement is due to earnings announcements. As a swing trader, positions can't be held through earnings, given the risk of big downside gaps. But if the stock tends to gap up 10% on an earnings announcement and then trade flat until the next one, it's not a good swing trade candidate. If that's the stock's personality, your profit potential is severely limited.


This was a lesson learned early on when IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) was still in beta. In March 2016, **Stamps.com** ([STMP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STMP)) showed a compelling move of 150% in just over a year's time. The arrows on the weekly chart show where five earnings announcements occurred. The average gain of those weeks was 25%, meaning the majority of that move was unplayable. Knowing what to avoid, by getting a different perspective, can allow you to focus on better, higher-probability trades.

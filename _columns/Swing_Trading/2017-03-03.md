Even winning trades have their occasional shakeout. Distinguishing a normal shakeout from a potential change in a stock's character can make a big difference in your batting average, the time spent in a trade and ultimately your profits.


Here's the rule: When you have a stock that's gone up 5% from your purchase price, we don't want to let that trade go negative. We set an alert at our 1% profit level and will get rid of the stock if it crosses below that. Having that large of a gain disappear raises the possibility that it can continue losing and become a negative trade. Even if it holds, it might reflect a stock that needs more time to make a move. A lot of time is not something we are inclined to give our stocks in a swing trade.


Sure, there will be some cases where it's just a shakeout and the stock goes up without you. That can be psychologically demoralizing as you look at gains that could have been and feel like you settled for less. But don't fall into the trap of abandoning the rule. It can save you from many more scenarios where things don't go your way.


**Fairmont Santrol** ([FMSA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FMSA))Â provides a cautionary tale. It had a strong bounce off its 50-day moving average line **(1)** closing near the top of its trading range on Feb. 8. It was put on [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 11.78. Using the low of the [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) day as a stop loss gave a larger than desired risk percentage, prompting a decision to [reduce the position size](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-can-help-balance-risk-and-reward/) to a half position.


The next day **(2)**, the stock already met the 5% profit goal. In the current market environment, we've been using the opportunity to take partial profits. In this case, we gave Fairmont Santrol more room since we already had a half position, the market seemed to be cooperating and there was strong industry group support, specifically with companies related to fracking sand.


Not wanting to let the strong gains evaporate, we set an alert for the stock if it went below our 1% profit level at 11.90. It was triggered a couple days later **(3)** as the stock fell below its 5-day moving average. Fairmont Santrol was removed with an adjustment to the profit to reflect the half position. Although volume was low for the day, the rule was still followed due to the price action. Better to leave with a small profit than risk a continuation of the negative action.


If it had been held, over the next five days you would have seen your trade go negative by more than 1% from your purchase price and eventually turn positive again. But even when turning positive, the stock was still not able to hold its gains for very long, reversing from highs for two consecutive days **(4)**. This was the last warning sign before a 13% plunge **(5)** that would have done unnecessary damage to your portfolio.

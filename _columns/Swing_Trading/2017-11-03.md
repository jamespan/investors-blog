It's nearly a staple of the villain's playbook to tell the hero how useless resistance is. Heroes and [swing traders](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) know better. Paying attention to resistance in a stock can reward you handsomely for breakouts or help you escape a losing trade's clutches with downside reversals.


Areas of resistance on a chart act like a ceiling for a stock's price action. The stock may bounce up to same general level, but then it hits its head on the ceiling and falls back down. When it does break through, especially with volume to propel it, a stock can have smooth sailing ahead without any barriers. However, when an area of resistance is tested a number of times without breaking through, it can indicate that the stock may need more time to breach the area.


Take a recent trade in **Weight Watchers** ([WTW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WTW)) on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). Its entry was off a solid bounce from the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) accompanied by strong volume **(1)**. An area of resistance just above 48 seemed to occur in August, and if the stock reached that level, it would be looking at roughly a 5% gain from the entry.


The stock was hugging the 50-day line tightly before its addition, but then the action started turning erratic. The day following its 6.5% gain on the bounce from the 50-day line saw nearly all the gains evaporate **(2)**. Two days later, Weight Watchers broke above the area of resistance but couldn't cross above 48 and gave back the majority of its gains again **(3)**. The wider trading range between the high and low suggested greater price uncertainty.


We exited the trade just a week after its entry when the stock made another attempt above 46 that was unsuccessful and reversed **(4)**. Two days later, it was a similar story **(5)** and it wasn't until a week after that Weight Watchers was able to challenge the 48 level again before getting turned away again **(6)**. Two weeks after that and the stock is still languishing between 44 and 46.


The earlier exit may have missed an opportunity for locking in a larger gain, but that presumes a later exit would have been close to the top and before the stock's many downside reversals. Consider also that holding the stock could have easily put you with a month's worth of time and no gains to show for it and all the risk that comes with holding.


Nothing about selling precludes you from entering the stock again. Weight Watchers continues to consolidate on low volume while still maintaining its price around the 50-day moving average. With resistance firmly established at around 48, a new line in the sand is apparent. Identifying that resistance is anything but useless.

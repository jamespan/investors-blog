When taking the family on a road trip, you plot your route and expect to stick to it. But you might run into a few twists and turns. Accidents and weather may lead to detours. A scenic route might catch your fancy. Those whining kids make you speed up for the next rest stop.


With [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), you also need a certain flexibility to maximize profit and minimize losses.


William O'Neil, founder of IBD, referred to the flexibility in his own trading as "bending with the breeze." He, like many legendary traders, would quickly discard a strong conviction given a change in market conditions or chart patterns. Defending your initial assessment when conditions have deteriorated is a sure way to lose money. In reality, you are usually protecting your ego rather than your money.


[IBD's Swing Trader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) starts with an initial assessment and goal, but has no problem shifting gears and communicating with subscribers via alerts.


Take a recent trade in  **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)). The stock was added on Jan. 24 after [breaking out](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787) of a two-week consolidation **(1)**, part of a larger [pattern](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736314&sourceid=735787). Yandex gapped up at the open and was bought at 22.99 with volume coming in at the highest level of the short consolidation. The setup initially stated a profit goal of 5% to 10%, with possible earlier profits being taken with a decisive close below the 5-day moving average line.


All was well the next day as the stock quickly reached more than a 3.5% profit **(2)**. Following the nice gain, Yandex dropped nearly to the entry price, but volume petered out. By the end of the week **(3)**, Yandex rallied again, but reversed and traded in the lower part of its range for the day. This was the second time Yandex was turned back from its prior high of 23.87 in August (not shown on the chart).


In addition to the action on the individual stock chart, the market also started flashing warning signals. The Nasdaq composite was making new highs, but that was coupled with [extremely low readings](https://www.investors.com/news/the-only-thing-investors-have-to-fear-is-no-fear-itself/) on the CBOE Volatility Index, lagging small-cap indexes and a high distribution count.


The initial trade goals for Yandex were scrapped in favor of locking in the profit as it stood. The stock was removed at 23.61 for a 2.7% profit in four days.


The removal of Yandex proved prescient as it fell with the market the next week and could have easily been removed at a loss rather than the modest profit.


That kind of flexibility, over the long run, gets you to your destination with the best possible ride.

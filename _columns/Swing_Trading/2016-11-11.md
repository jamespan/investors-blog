With the election over, investors are adjusting to the reality of Donald Trump as the president-elect. After an initial negative reaction on election night, the end result has been a sudden shift in sector leadership as assets got re-priced for the prospects of the new administration and direction of the economy. Areas previously out of favor were suddenly bouncing strongly. Now, how do we profit from it?


The IBD style of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) relies on some underlying strength in the stock when looking at reversals of fortune such as this. We're not trying to catch the bottom, but rather capitalize on movement in a stock after it starts a trend in the opposite direction. Foremost, we need significant evidence of strength. Some of the strongest moves postelection came from stocks that were previously in long-term declines. For these stocks a look at bottoming bases may help. A beaten down stock may be ripe for a comeback if it can first show enough power to form a base where the breakout is above its 50- and 200-day moving averages. This could be the setup for profits in the near future.


So where do we go from here? [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) is currently letting the dust settle and looking for the next opportunities with a keen eye on sector rotation. Take the **ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF** ([BIB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIB)). This is a leveraged ETF, meaning the moves up and down are amplified to give investors the larger potential moves of an individual stock but with the risk diversified over a basket of stocks. The ETF was well below both its 50- and 200-day moving averages amid a painful 15-month downtrend.


The day after the election saw an 18% jump in the ETF **(1)**putting it back above both longer-term moving averages. That sets the ETF up as a potential bottoming base pattern. After a slight pullback on Friday, the ETF could offer an entry if it consolidates for a few days below the recent high of 49.35 **(2)**. Leading stocks in the sector with a similar setup also would be ripe for additions to current trades.


In addition to the biotech names, financials have been an area of strength. They immediately benefited from a rise in the 10-year Treasury yield and the expected rate hike by the Federal Reserve next month is looming. The chance for removal of stifling regulations is also helping. The market also seems to be expecting infrastructure to provide a major source of investment. That's translated into strength in building and materials sectors. Additionally, miners in the industrial metals such as copper are also seeing a boost. Plenty of sources for the next profitable trade.

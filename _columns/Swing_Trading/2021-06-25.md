What a difference a week makes! Growth is back and our [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) entries are working much better. Software stocks and semiconductor stocks showed early signs of strength that foretold a comeback in technology. ASML stock, in particular, made for some great swing trades while the Nasdaq composite corrected.




Early Profits Helped Keep ASML Stock
------------------------------------


The last few months haven't been easy for growth but this week felt like a turning tide. It's worth noting that semiconductor stocks were a rare spot of strength even when the Nasdaq composite was weak. Not all of them, mind you, but a select few. **ASML** ([ASML](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASML)) seemed to be a semiconductor stock [poised to see strong demand from the semiconductor shortage](https://www.investors.com/research/asml-stock-range-amid-global-chip-shortage-makes-three-top-lists/).


On May 13, ASML stock bounced strongly from its 50-day moving average line offering another swing trading opportunity **(1)**. We added the semiconductor stock to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) the next day **(2)** as it broke above the highs of May 11. At that point in the market trend, profits were quickly evaporating and so we locked in our first third profit at 2.5% on the same day.

Selling some into strength helps you hold should the stock have a wiggle later. ASML stock tumbled in the morning a few days later **(3)**. We will often give a stock a little while after the open to get a better sense of its direction and that decision helped in this case. After the initial drop in the semiconductor stock, we put an alert at the low of the day in early trading. ASML stock steadily rose the rest of the day and we kept our remaining position.


Semiconductor Stock Strength Picks Up
-------------------------------------


As ASML stock approached 7.5% profit **(4)** another semiconductor stock set up for a breakout: **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). With the confirmation of strength we decided to give ASML stock more room. We held through a downside reversal **(5)** as it held the gains from the gap a few days prior. Even a breach of the [5-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-averages-can-help-lock-in-stock-profits/) didn't sway us as ASML stock got support at its 10-day moving average line **(6)**.


We eventually did take another third of profits as the semiconductor stock approached 9% profit **(7)**and the 700 price level. We were also approaching a month's holding time, unusual for swing trading. Why the long hold? It was working, easily holding the 10-day line and with two thirds profit already booked, we had little risk.


Even after ASML stock stretched above 700, it seemed to hold the next few days **(8)**. However, when another bout of rotation unnerved us on the market, we parted ways as it gapped down below the lows of the past few days and breached its 10-day line **(9)**.


The early profit taking allowed for a longer hold but at the end of the day we didn't want to overstay our welcome. Semiconductor stocks are still worth watching and Nvidia stock has reasserted its leadership role. But ASML has often been a more steady and easier hold, and could setup for another move.

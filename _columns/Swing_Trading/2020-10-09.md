A stock market correction is just part of the game with [swing trading.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) But there can be big differences in how you handle them. Ahead of the September stock market correction, we made a shift in position size. As the correction unfolded, a combination of less trading and smaller position sizes helped us weather the storm with limited damage.




Swing Trading Strategy Before A Stock Market Correction
-------------------------------------------------------


This year, we started treating [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as a [portfolio for performance calculations](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-swing-trading-performance/). Every position, addition, reduction and deletion has a transaction in shares associated with it based on the price at the time of the alert to subscribers. We started the year with eight full positions equating to a fully invested portfolio. In other words, a starting position size of 12.5% weight.


With the strong snapback from the coronavirus stock market crash, we had unusually strong gains in the market. As a result, we tempered our expectations ahead of the September stock market correction.


Rather than 12.5% for a full position [we switched to a 9% weight for full positions on Aug. 14.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-adjustments-temper-swing-trading-risk/) We notified subscribers and readers of this column about the switch. The reason? The risk gets larger as the [market gets extended](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/nasdaq-composite-provides-guidance-for-swing-trading/). Your position size might stay the same weight, but the dollar size is growing. That can have a larger financial impact on your swing trading when the inevitable stock market correction comes.


We also naturally [reduce exposure by locking in profits on a third of the position quickly](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sq-stock-taking-early-profits-made-holding-easier/). Locking in profits on the way up will naturally reduce exposure. If there aren't any setups to replace the positions with, that tells you something about the market.


Fewer Trades And Lower Weight Equals Lower Exposure
---------------------------------------------------


One of the best things you can do when faced with a stock market correction is to trade less. The number of our current trades at the end of the day averaged 12.8 in August and dropped to 5.4 in September. When we were right, we locked in profits quickly. When we were wrong, which happens more frequently in a correction, we cut the losses quickly.


No question, the stock market correction delivered a hit to our swing trading. But that hit was less due to the lower exposure. It was the lowest average exposure for the month since the coronavirus stock market crash. March saw the average percentage invested at the end of the day at 5.7% and averaged less than one stock on at the end of each day. For September, it was a more robust 38.5% invested. But that pales in comparison to August at 99.5%. There's even more of contrast in May and June when we played more aggressively. Those months saw average exposure at 134.5% and 120.1%, respectively.


Monthly Comparisons
-------------------


Think of it this way: The pullbacks in May and June created upside reversals. As a result, we had plenty of opportunities to get aggressive. The stock market correction in September required more cautious action. We still made attempts because the market can snap back quickly, but our swing trading was less. In fact, we most frequently traded the ProShares Ultra S&P 500 ETF ([SSO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSO)). It was a way to participate should the market move, but allowed us to [react quickly when it faltered](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-use-exit-strategy-for-swing-trading/). In March, with a severe stock market correction, there was little to no action.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Month | Average number of
stocks (end of day) | Average percent
invested (end of day) |
| January | 6.7 | 63.5% |
| February | 5.2 | 52.3% |
| March | 0.9 | 5.7% |
| April | 6.7 | 51.7% |
| May | 14.3 | 134.5% |

| July | 10.7 | 86.3% |
| August | 12.8 | 99.5% |
| September | 5.4 | 38.5% |


The swing trading take-away is to temper your exposure to your environment. Don't be tempted to overtrade in a stock market correction just to recover what was lost or compound great gains you already have. Let the market dictate when to get aggressive and when to back away.

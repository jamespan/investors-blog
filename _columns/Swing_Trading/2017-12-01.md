It's never fun to take a loss in a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), but it's a lesson that is best to learn early. Taking a small loss in Alibaba protected your portfolio from a 10-point drop that followed over the next week and brings up a critical element of investing: make sure you live to fight another day.


As an investor, you will make mistakes and you will have losing trades. It happens to the best traders. A key component of swing trading is [keeping those losses small](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/), especially in relation to your winners. Since we take profits quick, we need to take losses even quicker. Do that and you can make money even if half your trades are losses.


Having [sell rules](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/rules-help-combat-self-doubt-and-lead-to-more-profits/) is critical in this endeavor because you will often need to fight your emotions: The hope that a stock will come back, the fear that you will miss out on a big move, or the ego that doesn't want to admit defeat.


Don't be concerned if the stock immediately goes up without you, it's going to happen. But you will also see numerous occasions where the quick sell will save you money or, just as important, time. A stock that goes sideways always carries the risk of another sell-off, plus the opportunity cost of not being in a better stock.


That was the case with **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)), a recent trade on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). The giant Chinese online retailer was already a leading stock, and we were looking to capture a short-term profit. Alibaba pulled back to its 50-day moving average and bounced, a clear sign of support. It then followed through on that bounce the following day **(1)**. That set up the swing trade opportunity.


Two days later, on Nov. 20, Alibaba cleared a previous area of resistance at 188 and joined SwingTrader **(2)**. Volume was the highest level in more than 10 days **(3)** but the close was in the lower half of the trading range. Not an ideal finish, but not a deal breaker either.


After a few days in profitable territory, Alibaba triggered a sell rule by closing decisively below its 5-day moving average line **(4)**. We exited the stock before the close that day with a loss just over a half percent.


The 10-day moving average could be used in some market environments, but this year we've gravitated toward the 5-day line. That's been a function of small shallow corrections followed by relatively small rallies in the market.


It turned out to be a good sell since the stock lost another 7% over the course of the week. That kind of loss could wipe out a lot of progress in swing trading. IBD's Leaderboard, which also counted Alibaba as a member at the time, treated the stock differently but it's important to realize the distinction in strategy between the two products. Leaderboard put Alibaba on the Leaders list [back in April at 111](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/holding-alibaba-stock-was-easy-buying-it-was-tricky/), so had a profit cushion of around 70%. That kind of cushion changes the math on how much room you can give a stock to correct.

The last week has seen some big swings in the market but cautious action on IBD's [**SwingTrader**](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) product. Even with the Nasdaq nearing new highs, names are sparse and the trend is listed as Sideways. Analyzing the index and adding the S&P 500 for comparison gives some insight into the decision.


The S&P 500 got above 2180 on Aug. 5 **(1)** and then basically went sideways for five weeks, making little more than a 0.5% gain from 2180. The Nasdaq fared a little better when it also surged above resistance at 5200 on Aug. 5 **(1)**. It was able to make progress of just over 1.5% in the next five weeks.


However, neither market provided the tailwinds necessary for a more profitable trading environment. That's why few names were on the [**Current Trades**](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/past) list when the Sept. 9 rout occurred. The market had already given an early signal to back away.


On Sept. 9 **(2)**, both indexes broke support at their prior resistance levels. That was enough to suggest extra caution, and the action since then has kept the caution flag up.


The Nasdaq has looked stronger in the last week, largely from an 11% gain in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). At a 6.6% weight in the Nasdaq composite, Apple certainly carries influence. But wide swings in the tech-heavy index smacks of uncertainty.


Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has parked itself under its 50-day moving average, not showing much inclination to break below the Sept. 9 lows, but not really challenging the moving average line to the upside either.


Culling ideas to put on SwingTrader has resulted in few names cooperating. Volume was often high on the down moves and much lighter on the [**reversals**](https://www.investors.com/category/research/swing-trading/), not the display of strength that usually leads to a high-probability swing trade.


A final factor to consider: Short shallow market corrections tend to be followed by brief, less productive rallies. Corrections in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 usually must hit 5% or more before you can confidently capitalize on reversals and breakouts in individual stocks. So far the Nasdaq has dipped only 3.6% and the S&P just 3.4%.


That leaves us with a wait-and-see approach for a better environment rather than trying to guess the coin flip of market direction, or lack of direction.


Here's what to look for next week. A decisive break below 2120 on the S&P 500 and/or  5100 on the Nasdaq could suggest more correction to come. New highs in the indexes and more participation from the S&P 500 would bolster a more bullish outlook. But without much of a correction it will be hard to have conviction in the market as a whole. Individual [**pockets of strength**](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/new-highs/medical-sector-n…of-market-health/) in **biotechs**, semiconductors and other leading industries may provide limited trading opportunities.

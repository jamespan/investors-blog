After a Trade war, recession fears, impeachment inquiry and Fed meetings. Together they've kept the Nasdaq composite stuck between its 50- and 200-day moving average lines. Is this the wall of worry the market needs to climb or the beginning of a stock market correction? Thinking through potential scenarios ahead of time helps prepare you mentally for action down the road.




Range Bound Markets Are Tough For Trading
-----------------------------------------


First, consider how we got here. Our concern began as we saw a ["vertical violation"](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-swing-trading-profits/) on the Aug. 5 plunge through the 50-day moving average line **(1)**. Sharp moves like that tend to precede a stock market correction that lasts for at least a couple of months. One need only look to a [year ago for a glaring example](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-bearish-market-outlook/). Granted with a headline-driven catalyst, like the trade war with China, there is a danger that a headline turns the stock market back up just as quickly.


What followed was a lot of back and forth action below the 50-day moving average line but the Aug. 5 low held. Not much of a stock market correction there. On Sept. 5, the Nasdaq composite broke above the 50-day line **(2)** with a pickup in trading volume. That former area of resistance became a level of support for the index over the next few weeks, but growth stocks weren't so lucky. Though the indexes didn't move that much, Sept. 9 and 10 saw a huge rotation out of growth **(3)**. Where did the money go? Small-cap indexes started to outperform after lagging most of the year and value started showing strength.


Stock Market Correction Signs?
------------------------------


The major indexes largely masked the rotation and continued to maintain themselves above the 50-day line. That is until Sept. 24. when the Nasdaq composite broke below the 50-day line in heavier volume **(4)**. That also prompted a market action downgrade on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) to reflect the tougher environment expected over the next couple of weeks.


Headlines continued to batter the index allowing for a short-term trend line to be drawn along the highs of the last couple of weeks **(5)**. But as bad as it got, we hesitated to go short. Part of that is due to headline risk potentially turning things around. But also the selling was so relentless, by the time the index touched its 200-day line **(6)**, the likelihood of a bounce to the upside was on the rise. You also had the [CBOE Volatility Index](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-vix-can-help-confirm-market-bottoms/) spike nearly 30% above its 10-day line and the Put/Call ratio spike above 1.15. That suggests fear levels potentially getting excessive. (Both indicators can be found on our [Psychological Market Indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/) page with critical thresholds marked on their charts).


Stock Market Outlook From Here
------------------------------


With no progress made on the Nasdaq composite since the vertical violation **(1)** from two months ago, where do we go from here? We are at an inflection point so we need to watch for the stock market to telegraph its next move. A break above the short-term trendline **(5)** could suggest an opportunity for some upside movement. Look for the index to also clear its 10-day moving average line and 50-day moving average line. Resistance at those levels and a subsequent failure would suggest problems ahead and our focus will shift to shorting ideas. Watch for support at the 200-day line and the Aug. 5 low. A break below those levels could turn into a more serious stock market correction.

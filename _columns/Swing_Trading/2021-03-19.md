With the Nasdaq composite still in a correction, strength continues to be found mostly outside of tech. While [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) can help reduce drawdowns should the entire market pull back, some swing trades could be turned into position trades. Polaris stock is a recent example.




Swing Trading Example: Polaris Stock
------------------------------------


The leisure section always seems to be an area where you can find stock market winners. As people have tired from staying at home during Covid, the appeal of outdoor activities makes sense. **Polaris** ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) focuses on this space. It offers boats to snowmobiles, motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles. Looking at the monthly chart, Polaris stock has a tendency of long periods of sideways movement that can lead to sustained appreciation over years.



More recently, Polaris stock demonstrated similar action over a shorter time frame. On the daily chart, you can see sideways action starting at the end of January **(1)** and lasting a little over a month. But on March 4, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fell below their [50-day moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-a-key-reference-for-investors/), PII stock held above its [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) **(2)**.

The tight closes and refusal to give up ground was an important clue. Even better, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) moved into new high ground before the price **(3)**. When the indexes look weak, it's hard to remember to keep an eye out for strength. But that's where you find the next crop of winners.


Swing Trade Or Position Trade?
------------------------------


Polaris stock didn't require a long wait. The next day it cleared resistance around 126 and joined [SwingTrader](https://get.investors.com/swingtrader/?intcode=start%7Cstart%7Cprdmcst%7C2021%7Cna%7Cst%7Cna%7C%7C397709&src=A011LPH) **(4)**. By the end of the day, we already had a nice gain and it continued after the weekend **(5)**. Notably, the base was long enough to meet our standard definitions, making PII stock an attractive idea as a position trade as well. In fact, it joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) for that reason.


However, the paths for swing trading and position trading diverged. That kind of strength is attractive for a position trader and suggest you have a winner. Maybe even something you could hold through a modest pullback. For swing trading, we had a more than 6% gain from our entry and so we took a third of profit into the strength. Generally, you won't be holding swing trades long enough to wait through a pullback, so taking the gains while you have them is the usual swing-trading strategy.


But what kind of pullback is OK for swing trading? Polaris stock made it pretty easy. It remained above its 5-day moving average line with some brief and tight sideways movement **(6)**. Shortly after that, we had a more than 10% gain in just over a week. We took another third of profit **(7)**.


Sell Decisions Depend On Holding Times
--------------------------------------


When Polaris stock broke below its 5-day line **(8)**, that's when the decisions got harder for swing trading. Even though we some took profits already, we didn't want to see our healthy gain diminish. The strong close and support at the 10-day moving average line were compelling enough to see how the next day played out.


At the end of that day, Polaris was closing near its lows and decisively below its 10-day line **(9)**. We removed it from SwingTrader late in the session. It was also a weak close for all the market indexes, and we didn't want to risk a potential gap down. Our holding period is short and we got a strong gain quickly so that fits the bill. Sure we could see the stock go up without us, like [we saw with **Vipshop** (](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-ideas-can-morph-to-position-trades-vips-stock/)[VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) trade. But taking the gains quickly also helps avoid drawdowns.


As a position trade for Leaderboard, however, no action is required. The stock is still holding well above its 21-day line and even got an upgrade on Friday. Unless the market headwinds increase in the S&P 500, the early strength is compelling enough to give Polaris stock room to rally higher.

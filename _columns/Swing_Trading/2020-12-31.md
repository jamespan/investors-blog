When looking at some of the best stocks of 2020, Peloton stock finds its way onto many lists. As people created gyms at home, the fitness bikes and on-demand classes benefited the [coronavirus stock market](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/) play. While swing trading didn't capture its nearly 500% move in 2020, it did offer times of big gains in short periods of time.




Swing Trading Example: Peloton Stock
------------------------------------


**Peloton Interactive** ([PTON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PTON)) made the bulk of its move this year before September. The correction that followed gave a new opportunity after Peloton stock clung to its 50-day moving average a number of weeks. It joined SwingTrader on Dec. 14 after crossing back above the 50-day line **(1)**.

The profits came quickly for PTON stock. We took a third of the position off the next day with a 3.5% gain **(2)**. Another third came off the following day with 7.5% profit **(3)**. The goal in swing trading is to get the bulk of the move quickly in a stock and then move on. By booking the early profit, you can give the remaining position some room to run.


PTON Stock Picks Up The Pace
----------------------------


And Peloton stock did run. After a strong six consecutive days of gains, it jumped more than 10% when [Peloton announced the acquisition of Precor](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor?sf134632995=1) **(4)**. Investors applauded the potential step-up in manufacturing capability to address supply constraints. While that is good for the long-term prospects for Peloton stock, the swing trading view is different.


Since we already had nearly a 20% gain, we viewed the 10% move on top of that as an opportunity to exit our remaining position. Peloton stock provided more than a 30% move in just seven days. No reason to get greedy.


Did we leave some potential gains on the table? Possibly. Peloton stock tested the lows of the gap-up day on Dec. 23 but found support **(5)**. The next day it got into new high territory briefly but then closed low in its trading range **(6)**. It was also back below our final exit price.


The Great Debate: Sell Into Strength Or Weakness?
-------------------------------------------------


If we waited for weakness in Peloton stock as our exit signal, how would we have fared? Not as good. We often use a decisive close below the short-term 5-day moving average as a line in the sand for swing trading exits. That would have meant giving up nearly 7% from our sell into strength when it triggered **(7)**.


Often when we've already booked gains, we give a stock more room and may allow it to come into the 10-day moving average line. Sure, it tested that level and got support (**8)**. But that meant you also had to be comfortable with more than a 10% drawdown. Plus an extra week of time elapsed with that money at risk.


There are plenty of examples where a stock moves higher without us. But this is a case where selling into strength was the better call.

When you're driving down the road, your speed is often tempered by your visibility. When you have blind curves or fog, you slow down. The same might be said for the market. While the long-term prospects have a lot of potential, a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) style may still require caution on our speed. The Market Action in [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) product keeps abreast of short-term market trends and here are a few signs we'll be watching to help judge trading velocity in the new year.


**Watch The Divergence**
------------------------


In this column [a month ago](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/using-the-past-to-give-context-to-the-present/), we pointed out that an unusual divergence was occurring between the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq Composite. The Russell's performance was surpassing the Nasdaq by a differential not seen in more than a decade. The first week of 2017 saw a different picture. The Russell 2000 corrected more, bounced back less, and even had days in sharp contrast to the Nasdaq's. On Jan. 5, for example, the small-cap indexes were down more than 1% while the Nasdaq was up mildly. Of course, a single data point doesn't make a trend, but continued divergence is worth watching.


**Be Careful Of 'V-shaped' Patterns**
-------------------------------------


On the short term, the Nasdaq is offering a ["V-shaped" pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/know-this-key-sell-signal-why-a-v-shaped-base-spells-trouble/). The "V" shape, where a correction is immediately followed by movement straight back to new highs, is prone to failure, or at least a mild break, before leading to a sustained rally. In stocks, this pattern offers a little-known offensive selling opportunity. After a prolonged run, a sharp pullback down to the 10-week moving average line followed by an immediate to rebound to new highs often occurs at the peak.


The Nasdaq is showing some of those attributes right now with a one-week pullback followed by a one-week recovery to new highs. However, the pullback wasn't very sharp at around 2.5%. However, shallow market corrections generally lead to short rallies that make little progress into new high ground before going sideways again.


Secondary Indicators And Short-Term Tops
----------------------------------------


Other indicators are also at levels usually associated with short-term tops rather than bottoms. The CBOE Volatility Index (the "VIX") is low, the number of stocks above their 50- and 200-day moving averages is high, and the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers shows a lot more bullishness than bearishness (a contrarian indicator where the market usually goes opposite to the sentiment).


**Don't Forget About The Long-Term Potential**
----------------------------------------------


While we haven't seen much in the way of  large and prolonged corrections the last few years, we have waded through two to three years of sideways action. That might not scare a lot of investors out of the market, but it has certainly worn some out. A long period of sideways action can often act as a reset in the same way a traditional bear market with a 20%-plus correction would.


**Stay Flexible With Projections**
----------------------------------


While an expectation based on history is essential to informing your investing decisions, ignoring divergences from your expectations can be perilous. The market is constantly giving you feedback as to whether your thesis is correct. Astute investors make constant corrections to their course based on that feedback. While current market sentiment looks at a Trump administration as economically favorable, that could change when the reality of administrating hits. But making changes based on market  conditions will help get you to your investment destination safely.

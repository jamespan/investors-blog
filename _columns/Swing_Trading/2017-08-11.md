It's disheartening when you analyze a stock, pass on buying it, then watch it go up without you. Just to torture yourself a little more, you might even calculate how much money you missed out on. But if you are following rules designed to put the odds in your favor, missing out on a stock here and there is going to happen. After all, probabilities are not certainties. Sound [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) rules stress being right on enough trades over the long term to more than make up for the times where the rules may lead to short-term misses on individual trades. In other words, you can be wrong on an individual trade but right in your trading.


Take **Best Buy**  ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)), a standout stock at the end of July that was on the [watchlist](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/consider-watch-lists-homework-that-pays-off/) of IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). But it never became an active trade even as it made a decent move up. Despite overall weakness in retail, Best Buy and its group mate **Aaron's** ([AAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAN)) in consumer electronics retail both made the elite set of stocks with [Composite Ratings](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771) above 90. As the market was showing negative action on July 27, Best Buy and Aaron's were up more than 2% **(1).**The countertrend put both stocks under consideration for SwingTrader.


Best Buy won out since Aaron's had an earnings report scheduled the next day.


While the price action looked promising for Best Buy, as well as its [Relative Strength](http://education.investors.com/Lesson.aspx?sourceid=735774&id=735771), volume was lackluster for the day **(1)**. Volume is one of the more critical factors to fuel a big move, and while stocks can go up without it, the chances of success are far less favorable. Continued consolidation on low volume would have been the most desirable scenario, but stocks don't always cooperate with your hopes for them.


Best Buy continued higher over the next few days and eventually crossed a 59.70 buy point of a [double-bottom](http://education.investors.com/education/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787&page=2) consolidation. It happened shortly after the market open **(2)**, but a note was immediately sent to subscribers noting that volume was still unimpressive. Best Buy would remain on the watchlist, rather than becoming an active trade. Though volume improved slightly over the day, the price worsened and ended up below the buy point by the close.


The stock continued up another 4% **(3)**, but volume never came in and Best Buy never became an active trade. The combination of a weak market and lack of volume didn't instill confidence in the stock's prospects. Sure, in hindsight that was proved to be false, but that doesn't mean the logic wasn't sound. No need to break rules to let in this one trade when a good market will give you multiple opportunities to profit with better odds.

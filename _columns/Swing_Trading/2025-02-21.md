Growth stocks took some hard hits this past week. The major market indexes didn't really show the damage to many high-valuation stocks. In the case of Axon stock, it was an example of a pretty perfect setup that just didn't work â€” unless you took profits quickly.




Early Entry For Axon Stock
--------------------------


The latest rally offered a number of early entries for stocks and **Axon Enterprise** ([AXON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXON)) was a great example. It broke above its 50-day moving average line with power **(1)**. Keep in mind, this was just a day after many AI-related stocks got hit as investors were introduced to DeepSeek's entrance into the field.


Axon initially joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(2)** after it popped above 670 following three days of getting turned away at that level. The biggest problem was that it was a little on the extended side so we quickly exited when it didn't follow up the next day **(3)**. Our assessment was that after the big move from its lows of the base, it probably needed to add a handle.


Upside Reversal Offers Another Chance
-------------------------------------


There was a lot to like about the next setup. Axon came down for four consecutive days but often closed in the upper part of its range. That shows a resilience and fight against going down. Our reentry was on the upside reversal **(4)**. Axon saw a wide spread that started with a shakeout, saw support at its 21-day line and then a powerful move with a close near its peak.


They don't get much better looking than that. However, no matter how good a setup looks, it doesn't guarantee success. Even pocket aces don't guarantee a win in poker. That's why we stuck with our normal rule of taking profits on a quarter position into strength **(5)**.

With a portion locked in, it gives you a little more chance of leaving the entire trade with a profit. Even if you come back to your entry.


Quick Exit Saved The Trade
--------------------------


The next day, high-valuation growth names started to see some cracks and Axon was close to patient zero. A [downgrade by Northcoast Research analyst Keith Hosum started the move down](https://www.investors.com/news/axon-stock-downgrade-flock-safety/). As the selling accelerated we exited the position at around 673, just 30 minutes into the trading session before we really had all the news **(6)**. We knew what was happening with the chart before fully understanding why it was happening. That's not unusual in swing trading where technical analysis gets a heavier weight in decisions.


The quick exit decision and early trim on strength allowed us to leave the trade with a gain of roughly 1.5%. More importantly, we avoided an even sharper downturn. By the end of the day, Axon fell an additional 10% from our exit **(7)**. It continued to fall through the remainder of the week.



Rather than planting a flag on how good the setup was or how overdone the move might have been, we looked at the evidence of the chart. There's a reason for the phrase "a picture is worth a thousand words."

When you talk stocks with other investors, there are the companies that get nods from everyone with their recognizable names — from the hottest IPO to the maker of a trendy consumer product to the latest technology heavyweight. But there are also names off the beaten path that may elicit a questioning glance. Those lower-profile companies offer plenty of opportunities.


Technical action is weighted more heavily in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), although it's not limited to an individual stock's performance. The broad market's action clearly has a huge influence on a trade.


Industry groups also can wield significant influence. That especially has been true as groups have fallen in and out of favor based on policy decisions of the Trump administration, as well as the likelihood of their successful implementation. These group movements need to be watched closely to reveal potential prospects.


**Huntsman** ([HUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUN)) isn't a name most folks would recognize, even if they might use their products. You find the company's polyurethane products in insulation, automotive interiors, and even in your shoes. A big factor for the company's entry on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) was group strength. Its Basic Chemicals group was showing movement — and Huntsman was a top stock of the group based on relative strength. **FMC Corp.** ([FMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FMC)) was another group member in contention, but Huntsman started moving first with accompanying volume.


The stock was added March 28 as it broke out of a one-month consolidation with the heaviest volume in weeks **(1)**. The entry price was at 23.69, and by the end of the day the stock was already up nearly 2%. A couple days later, Huntsman hit a 5% profit goal **(2)**. However, the Nasdaq composite was losing steam as it neared new highs, so half profits on Huntsman were taken at 24.90. In order to protect profit on the remaining shares, the stop was raised to 1% from the entry price. There is no reason to let a trade go negative once you have a decent profit.


The stock fell from there, along with the market, but found support on April 4 and nearly recovered the ground lost **(3)**. As the stock was approaching the level where half profits were taken, it looked like it could be running into resistance again. On the intraday chart, Huntsman seemed to be flattening out in the last two hours of trading and kept getting turned back at 24.80. So the decision was made to take the remaining profits for a total gain of 4.7% in five trading days.


By April 12, Huntsman skidded back near its entry as the market sold off again.

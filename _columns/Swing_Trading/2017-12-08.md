Being in phase with the market is a critical component for successful [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). This market hasn't made it easy. Sir Isaac Newton and his laws of motion offer an answer as to why.


For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to Newton's third law. Apply that to stocks and you can see that corrections in prices hold opportunities. Smaller corrections often see smaller bounces back, while steeper corrections tend to precede powerful moves to the upside.


Looking at the Nasdaq composite in the last three months is a microcosm into how the year has played out. The index has only crossed below the 50-day a handful of times the whole year and the rallies seem to be quick and short-lived. The last cross below the 50-day for the index was on Sept. 25 after correcting just over 2% **(1)**. Over the next three weeks the index gained over 4% **(2)**.


The next drop was only over the span of a week and wasn't even 2% off the high on Oct. 25 **(3)**. The index spent a few days below its 10-day moving average line but never threatened its 50-day line. Another gain just over 4% ensued in the next two weeks **(4)**. A duplicate of that action happened right after that. Less than a 2% correction at the low of Nov. 15 **(5)** and then a two-week rally of nearly 4% **(6)**.


In that latest run, we steadily increased the number of stocks on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) to five positions, the most this year. Profit locking and stringent loss cutting put us back down to only three positions one day off the top **(6)** and two of those were only half positions due to profit taking. The most recent low **(7)** on Dec. 6 settled at another drop around 2% off the high.


So where do we stand now? The index is trying to rally again, but so far it isn't as strong. That's kept the current market action for SwingTrader in a [sideways trend](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/this-old-adage-rings-true-for-sideways-markets/).


In the scheme of things, these drops are minor and barely blips on a longer-term chart. But the short-term nature of swing trading amplifies their importance. With rallies only lasting a couple of weeks before rolling over, profits not booked swiftly are generally lost. Also with daily moves to the upside remaining small, one sharp move to the downside can wipe out a lot of progress — a point made abundantly clear after an [erroneous news report](https://www.investors.com/politics/columnists/abcs-brian-ross-should-be-fired/) regarding the Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference of the 2016 election unsettled markets.


If you have more cushion from a longer-term trade, you have a chance to weather the storm. Barring that, taking profits quickly when entering positions from a shallow correction recognizes the likelihood of a limited rally. The laws of physics are hard to escape.

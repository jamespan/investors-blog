Even in strong stock market rallies, you'll have stocks that don't work. Carvana stock was a recent [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) example where we took a small loss to avoid an even bigger loss later. As strong as the setup looked at the outset, we don't argue against our rules.




Used Cars Delivered Via Vending Machine?
----------------------------------------


**Carvana** ([CVNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVNA)) is a recent initial public offering that started trading in April 2017. It operates an e-commerce platform for pre-owned vehicles. Don't want to haggle at the traditional dealership with the proverbial "used-car salesman?" The retail disruptor offers a different experience. That can culminate in receiving your vehicle from one of the Carvana vending machines. It's not profitable so far as it's heavily investing for expansion. But [Carvana stock has shown revenue growth](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/carvana-earnings-carvana-stock-q1-2019/) in the triple digits for the past 17 quarters. For recent IPOs, that can be a strong indicator of good things to come.


In terms of the technical picture, Carvana stock is prone to quick moves to the upside and some pretty severe corrections. That's not atypical behavior for a recent IPO and potentially lucrative for swing trading. This latest correction in Q4 2018 hit 60%. Bases that deep have a higher failure rate. However, the action more recently tightened up. You could consider it as a handle to the previous cup-shaped base but it's long enough to be a base in its own right.


This more recent action started with a move down to its 50-day moving average line. The 50-day moving average line often acts as a floor that stocks will bounce off as they are trending higher. When they fall below the line, it can act more like a ceiling and becomes a resistance level for the stock. That's what happened with Carvana stock. It initially got support **(1)** but just over a week later it closed below the line **(2)**. As Carvana stock came back up to the 50-line it was turned away for another week **(3)**. What was support became resistance.


Swing Trading Example: Carvana Stock
------------------------------------


Whenever an area of resistance or support is breached decisively, that can be a catalyst for swing trading. Carvana stock broke above a five-week downtrend on June 18 as it gapped above its 50-day moving average line **(4)**. Volume was tracking at its highest in three weeks and it joined IBD [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). With any trade, it's important to have [an exit strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/when-to-sell-stocks-docusign-stock/). In this case, a move below the entry day low would put Carvana stock back below the 50-day moving average. That might not mean the stock is a complete failure but it could suggest weakness on a short-term basis.


For Carvana stock, the trouble started early. It looked great at the entry but by the close, the stock went from an 8.8% gain to a 3.7% gain. While still a strong gain, the close in the lower part of its trading range means a lack of appetite for the stock at the higher price. That weakness can often spill over into the next day. Our stop loss at the entry day low of 64.75 triggered the next day and [kept our loss small](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) **(5)**.


Things got worse from there as Carvana stock fell another 6.2% after our exit. While it has rebounded somewhat, it's still below our initial entry. Even if the stock goes up from here, the exit was sound because it followed rules. Breaking the rules and giving it more room to fall [could have easily resulted in a worse exit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-early-new-relic-stock/). Although this one has partly recovered, many don't. You have to protect yourself from all the possible scenarios.

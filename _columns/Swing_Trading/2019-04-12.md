With some of the most powerful stock moves, it's hard to know how much to expect in a short period of time. Stocks can go well beyond your goals for swing trading profits and make you wish you held longer. Rules help contain your emotions and give you guidelines. Will they always get you out at the top? No. But booking short-term gains quickly has its own rewards.




Autohome Stock Shows A Powerful Move
------------------------------------


Take **Autohome** ([ATHM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATHM)) at its recent [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/). The Chinese internet stock hit our radar after a 15% correction in March **(1)** rebounded with support near the 200-day moving average line. Autohome took a pause and added a handle to its [cup-shaped base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) **(2)**. The chart above focuses on recent activity, making it look like the cup with handle was just four weeks. If you step back and take a wider view, like on the adjacent weekly chart, you'll see that Autohome had a much longer base that started before last summer.



When Autohome broke out March 29 **(3),** it had a lot of elements that suggested swing trading profits to come. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) pushed to it highest level since July **(4)** and it had the largest [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) **(5)** since Jan. 14. It also earned a spot on the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) with its superior fundamental and technical action. We added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 96.51 as it made progress above its first-hour high.


The power continued and just over an hour later, we hit our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-stock-profits-on-the-way-up-to-compound-gains/). Like we often do, we took swing trading profits on half the position and raised our stop to 97.48. That's a 1% profit above our entry and [this rule helps keep the trade profitable](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/) even if the stock starts to fall. By the close **(3)**, we had nearly a 9% profit from our entry.


Taking swing trading profits on the same day is an unusual occurrence. Technically, it makes that portion of the trade a day trade. Yet it happens so infrequently on SwingTrader, you won't find yourself labeled a pattern day trader by your broker. We prefer [swing trading vs. day trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/day-trading-versus-swing-trading-comes-down-to-time/).


Keeping Our Swing Trading Profits
---------------------------------


The next day, Autohome was down 5.5% at its low **(6)**. It's enough of a drop to make doubt start creeping in. After a gain of more than 13% in a day, you should expect to give some back. But we still had cushion above our raised stop. The stock recovered much of the loss by the end of the day. Autohome continued to consolidate and a sharply rising 5-day moving average contained the sideways action. It was easier to hold the remaining position with the absence of a clear sell signal.


A week after the entry, Autohome reached its 10% profit goal and we exited the position **(7)**. The stock ran well beyond our exit but came to close in the middle of its trading range for the day. Of course, you can look at the intraday gains as profits that could have been. But between our two sells, the swing trading profits for the entire trade produced a 7.8% return in just one week. That's not bad. This past week, Autohome dropped below its 5- and 10-day moving average lines **(8)**and below our final exit. Holding out for a bigger gain could have easily led to a worse outcome.


That's not to say it can't go higher. For that reason, it remains a position trade on IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/). In fact, Leaderboard has the near-term high **(7)** marked as a new buy point at 111.70. But that doesn't take away from it being good swing trade sell while still being a good position trade hold. Swing trading uses different rules for the same stocks. We found ourselves in a similar situation with **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) and **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) remaining on Leaderboard for extra profits while [we booked a smaller quicker gain](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/chipotle-stock-price-selling-stocks/).

As earnings season unfolds, investors holding onto stocks hold their breath on each announcement. While big upside moves are enticing, the downside risk is enough to strike fear in the bravest  trader. Plus, the market has been in a Sideways Trend for well over a month making the risks seem greater than the potential rewards. Options do offer a way to at least cap the risk while still participating in the potential upside.


**Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) is a potential play that will be watched on [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) in the coming week. Alibaba was a successful options play last earnings season and featured in the [Earnings Preview column Aug. 5](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/alibaba-blue-buffalo-set-to-report-ice-earnings-impress/). The call option at an 84.50 strike price and Aug. 12 expiration offered a trade with just 2.2% downside risk, based on a premium of around 1.85 (1.85 premium / 84.00 stock price = 2.2% maximum risk).


The stock [broke out](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787) of a [cup with handle](http://education.investors.com/education/lesson.aspx?id=736315&sourceid=735787) **(1)** at 85.10 on Aug. 10, but with earnings due before the open the next day, buying the stock outright would have been an unnecessary gamble. The stock gapped up for a 5% move after earnings were reported **(2)** and the next day was even better, **(3)** jumping 7%. Exercising the option would have given you a cost basis of 86.35 (1.85 option premium + 84.50 strike price) and yielded a 14% profit by the close on Aug. 12. [IBD's Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/) product used this strategy successfully on the week of earnings.


Could Alibaba give a repeat performance? The stock is setting up another potential buy point as it has pulled back to the 50-day moving average for the second time **(4)** since its August breakout. Earnings will be released Nov. 2 before the open with estimates for another double-digit gain in quarterly earnings growth. Using the high of Oct. 27 as a buy point around 104.12, a call option with a 104 strike is trading around 3.30 for the Nov. 18 expiration. The weekly option with a Nov. 4 expiration at the same strike is trading around 2.12. The expiration further out is more expensive but it's still reasonable at around a 3.2% downside risk. The extra time can come in handy to give the stock time to develop more profit. Also, the monthly options tend to offer more liquidity.


Another stock on the watch list is **Activision Blizzard** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) offering a similar setup with a bounce off its 50-day moving average. The stock was just on SwingTrader for eight days when it started to pullback. It eked out a profit of just over 1%.
Activision's Nov. 18 expiration call with a 43.50 strike price is trading around 1.67. That's a maximum risk of 3.8% with the stock trading near 43.45. Third-quarter earnings will be announced Nov. 3 after the close and if the stock looks like it will get the bounce, the option could be the way to play it.


Again, for both examples a big caveat is the market's direction: Sideways. That's the most difficult type of market to play on both the long and short side.

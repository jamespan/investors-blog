While the market has been challenging for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) lately, it could be worse if you let losses get out of control. Here's how we cut our losses short in JetBlue stock to minimize the damage.




Swing Trading Example: JetBlue Stock
------------------------------------


As vaccinations increase and restrictions are lifted, long-postponed travel plans are picking up. We've already [played the airline industry a couple times](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/can-save-stock-take-off-again/) with **Spirit Airlines** ([SAVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAVE)) and the **US Global Jets ETF** ([JETS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JETS)). But after correcting through April and May, it looked like the group was setting up again.


**JetBlue** ([JBLU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JBLU)) initially caught our attention as it looked like it was breaking above a downtrend in mid-May **(1)**. Since it was still stuck under its 50-day moving average line, we passed on JetBlue stock at the time.


However, an even stronger move came a week later on May 25 and we added the stock toÂ [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(2)**. Though it looked great at the time, by the closing bell, JetBlue stock reversed and traded near its lows for the day. The downside reversal made us cautious and we took a third off the position as a result.


Heeding The Warnings
--------------------


The next couple days saw a partial recovery in JetBlue stock **(3)**. But the volume was much lighter on the recovery than on the reversal. It's a reason to be suspicious when you see weak volume on recovery attempts.


When JetBlue stock started to decline again **(4)**, it didn't have a decisive close below its 5-day moving average line at first. It also looked like the 50-day line could provide a logical area of support.

After the Memorial Day holiday, JetBlue stock continued to hold at its 5-day moving average line **(5)** so we continued to watch and wait. But once travel numbers started coming in from the holiday weekend, the effect on airline stocks differed. **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) jetted 4% on June 2 with travel at its highest level since the pandemic started. JetBlue stock, however, fell for the day **(6)** and looked like it would close below its 50-day line.


Rather than hope for a bounce, we acknowledged the divergence and cut our loss. As a result, we avoided a steep sell-off the following day **(7)** as JetBlue stock broke below multiple areas of support.

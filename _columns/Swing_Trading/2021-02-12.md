Nothing goes up forever, including the stock market. So when a stock market correction hits, which inevitably it will, what do you look for when getting back in? While the market pullback at the end of January wasn't much, it still helps illustrate the point.




Embrace The Benefits Of A Stock Market Correction
-------------------------------------------------


A stock market correction is not something to be feared. Rather look at the opportunities that come as a result. If you can sidestep a good portion of the drawdown, you are in a good position to take full advantage on the next move up. If you are ready.


At the end of January, we had a growing concern of an extended market. A quick pullback and recovery in the Nasdaq composite on Jan. 25 preceded more severe action on Jan. 27 through the end of the week.



Now look at the SPDR Biotech ETF ([XBI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XBI)). On Jan. 27, it came down with the market **(1)**. But when the Nasdaq composite went lower on Jan. 29, XBI held above its Jan. 27 low **(2)**. The relative strength line held up while the market pulled back.


On Feb. 1, as the Nasdaq composite bounced from its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), we were looking to increase exposure. The biotech ETF stuck out as a candidate because of how it held up. It joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day **(3)**. The Nasdaq pullback wasn't much of a stock market correction, but the principle holds true even in devastating bear markets.


I watched [William O'Neil, the founder of Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/bill-oneil-ibd-founder-and-stock-investor-success-tips/), use this same principle after the Financial Crisis of 2008 to pick some of the biggest winners of the cycle, even though they were still well off their highs.


The Benefits Of A Stock Market Correction
-----------------------------------------


You'll often find that the steeper the stock market correction, the stronger the bounce back. Again, 2009 is a great example. Since our January stock market correction was only 5.4%, we had lower expectations for gains. Especially with an ETF.


We took our first third profit after a 2.5% gain **(4)**. The second third came off when we hit our 5% profit goal **(5)**.

With more than an 8% gain in just over a week's time, we took the remaining third off XBI into strength **(6)**. [With ETFs, we expect a reversion to the mean](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/investing-in-sector-funds-can-spice-up-your-portfolio-how-to-do-it/). Also, at 18% above its 50-day moving average line, XBI was already extended by historical standards in our analysis.


Lower Drawdowns: A Swing Trading Advantage
------------------------------------------


As is often the case, [selling into strength](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/why-we-sold-gm-stock-early/) saved us from a drawdown. To be clear, the strategy will frustrate at times as trades go higher without you. But you also tend to have less severe drawdowns.


For XBI, a couple days later it sliced through the [5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) **(7)**. At the close of the week, the ETF was down 5% from our final exit and closing below its [10-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/use-the-10-day-moving-average-to-get-ahead-of-sell-signals/) **(8)**. We used rules based on precedent of stock market corrections to get into the trade, and rules based on precedent of the ETF's personality to get out of the trade. It's a combination for success that can be duplicated throughout time.

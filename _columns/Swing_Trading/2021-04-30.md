When it comes to [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), two to three weeks of sideways action can seem like a long time. But when you stay above the five- and 10-day moving average lines, as Carrier stock did, it makes for an easier hold.




Swing Trading Example: Carrier Stock
------------------------------------


While it may look like a fresh IPO, barely a year old, **Carrier Global** ([CARR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARR)) dates back to 1915. After more than a century of mergers and acquisitions, Carrier stock spun off from United Technologies, which is now **Raytheon Technologies** ([RTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RTX)).


The heating and cooling stock broke above a short trend line on March 22, and we added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(1)**. The end of March saw a pullback where the S&P 500 got support at its 50-day moving average line. Carrier stock slid down its own trend line, but did not close below the 10-day moving average or the entry-day low. That wasn't a great start but still within our SwingTrader rules, so we kept it.

On March 29, Carrier stock broke into new highs. We locked in our first profit, selling a third of our position nearly 5% up from our entry **(2)**.


Two weeks is not a long time for a position trade, but it feels like an eternity for a swing trade. For two weeks, Carrier stock hit resistance at 43.50, the March 31 high **(3).** But it also had support at its 10-day line. This is the kind of tight action that we look for with swing trading setups. If we didn't have a position already, April 13 presented a potential entry **(4)**. However, we already had the stock and were patiently waiting for the next move up. Finally on April 16, three weeks after taking our first profit, we took our second third off at nearly 8% **(5)**.


The Difference One Cent Makes
-----------------------------


April 19 did send a warning **(6)**. When you make new highs but end with a pullback, this can signal coming weakness. Plus, Carrier stock closed one cent lower than the previous trading day, turning that spike in volume red. We were still well above the five- and 10-day lines, and our earlier profit-taking allowed us to give the stock room with reduced risk.


On April 20, the S&P 500 reversed hard and took Carrier stock down with it **(7)**. Both dropped below their five- and 10-day lines, and Carrier stock even crossed its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) briefly. With earnings around the corner, we exited the position at the end of the day. We still had over a 4% profit from our entry. Our average exit left us with 5.5% profit on the trade.


Holding a stock for four weeks is not ideal for swing trading, but this has not been the best market. As good as the indexes looked, there was a large amount of rotation underneath. Sometimes you just have to take what the market gives you.

  Why We Handled GS Stock A Little Differently

Usually with [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), our holding time doesn't go beyond a couple of weeks. In the case of Goldman Sachs stock, we did something a little different.




Swing Trading Example: GS Stock
-------------------------------


[Financial stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/banks-and-financial-stocks-news-and-analysis-bofa-wellsfargo-jpmorgan-goldmansach/) were an area of outperformance in the market rally that started in November. We chose **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) as a way to increase exposure to that sector along with a [position in regional banks](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-woes-in-a-market-plagued-with-rotation/).


After GS stock had earnings, it found support near its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points) and broke above a downtrend line **(1)**. We added it to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day.


It was a tough hold in the first few days. GS stock started the day strong but closed well off its highs in the middle of its trading range.


While the next few days were up, GS stock remained below the high of its entry day. Then it dropped more than 3% and looked like it would have a decisive close below its 10-day line **(2)**. We removed a third of the position out of caution. With it so close to the 50-day line we gave it a chance to find support but also wanted to reduce our risk.


Rebound Validates Holding Decision
----------------------------------


The remaining position in Goldman Sachs stock rebounded off the 50-day line **(3)** and started to move up. Although we had a lighter position, we participated in the strong move with our remaining position. Once we hit [5% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/), we took off another third into strength **(4)**.

On May 10, GS stock showed a [downside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(5)**. That's a warning sign of potential weakness to come. However, we kept our position for two reasons. First, we had a lot of cushion and limited risk with just a third position left. Second, a lot of selling elsewhere that day put us in danger of our invested percentage getting too low. GS stock was kept for its relative strength. As it got support at its 21-day line, it looked like it was set up for another move.


And Now For Something Completely Different
------------------------------------------


On June 1, Goldman Sachs stock broke into new high ground and we added another full position to SwingTrader **(6)**. It was a fresh setup and the financial sector was still showing strength.


As usual, we wanted to book profits into strength and saw the opportunity as the new position reached 3% profit **(7)**. We took a third off our new position. It's a Last In First Out (LIFO) type of accounting. The result is that we keep our earlier low-cost shares and the profit cushion that comes with them.


Shortly after, GS stock pulled back to our entry but we held our remaining position as it found support at the 10-day moving average line **(8)**. But eventually we removed the remaining position after a big outside day closed near its lows and undercut the low of our second entry day **(9)**. No reason to let a good trade go bad.

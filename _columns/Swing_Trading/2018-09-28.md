Anyone who tells you defense doesn't matter isn't paying attention to how things actually work in swing trading. Cutting losses early in New Relic stock for a recent [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) saved capital for our next trades. When you are right you want to compound as much as possible. [Keeping losses small](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) is a critical component.




Swing Trading Example: New Relic Stock
--------------------------------------


If you ever watch a professional fight, you'll notice something about the fighters. They don't stand there and take unnecessary blows. Neither should you take unnecessary losses in your swing trading. Just as fighters often telegraph their punch, stocks often signal when weakness is to follow. Master your defense by cutting losses early and you improve your chances of winning the fight.


Take **New Relic** ([NEWR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NEWR)) this summer. After a 16% correction in July, New Relic stock met [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) twice around 107 in August **(1).**On Sept. 11, the stock jumped 3.5% and [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) above the 107 area with [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) coming in above average **(2)**. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day. Even though it was still a few percent away from its high, the early entry allows you to build some cushion before a more traditional buy point presents itself. The risk of failure might be higher, however money management rules help mitigate any potential added risk. That might include cutting losses early when a stock signals a problem.


A couple of days later and New Relic stock stretched its gain to over 3.5% before it showed a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(3)**. By the end of the day, the gains diminished and the trade was negative. A bearish reversal acts as an early warning system. Strong starts and weak closes are the opposite of what you see in successful trades. It might not require immediate action but it should heighten your focus and attention to cutting losses early.


Cutting Losses Early
--------------------


The next day, New Relic stock undercut the low of the bearish reversal day and also looked to close below its 5-day moving average line. Waiting for the stop loss would mean losing another 2%. Sure, there's always the possibility of a strong rebound. But the bearish reversal and subsequent weakness usually suggests more weakness to come, at least in the short-term. Cutting losses early is preferable. Why take another 2% hit on the trade when the odds have shifted against you? It's not pessimism, it's reacting to a new reality of a stock's prospects.


Unfortunately for New Relic stock, that reality included further losses. The next day saw a 6% drop. A week later, it was nearly 13% below our exit.


Losing trades are just a cost of doing business when trading. But hesitation, fear of taking a loss, or unrealistic hope for a rebound can all lead to losing more than you should on a trade. Those mistakes are just bad business.

Swing trade strategies should shoot for small profits in a short time. Swing trade example **Fibria Celulose** ([FBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBR)), a Brazilian paper stock, netted a 15% gain in 15 days. A gain like that can supercharge your portfolio. If you can hold on to it.




First, the setup. The stock market saw a violent 11% correction in February. That called for defensive action. But don't forget to look for new opportunities when the time is right. That started with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) on Feb. 14 when two stocks joined [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). On Feb. 16, we added a third swing trade, Fibria Celulose **(1)**. The paper stock from an emerging market stayed above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) during the market correction and broke its downtrend. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) stood at new highs ahead of the price, and volume ended at its highest level in nine months **(1)**. It had all the elements of a high-probability swing trade.


Swing Trade Example Jumps At The Start
--------------------------------------


By the end of our entry day, we were already up 3%. Fibria Celulose exceeded our first profit goal of 5% as it jumped 6.5% at the open the next day **(2)**. Two paths faced an investor at this point. Do you book nearly a 10% gain in just one day or hold a little longer to see if the paper stock can return even more? We compromised. We took half profits at the open and raised our stop on the remaining shares. With that much in profit already off the table, you can afford to give a stock more leeway.


Fibria Celulose took its time and consolidated tightly over the next couple of weeks. Only once did the stock challenge the [5- and 10-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/protect-profits-with-shorter-moving-averages/) **(3)**. But Fibria Celulose never had a decisive close below the lines. It was less than a percent below either of the lines at its close. Also the stock never got under 5% profit from our entry so we maintained a good profit cushion.


Hold Or Sell?
-------------


The patience paid off as the paper stock started to move again and [gapped up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) 6% to new highs **(4)**. The following day, we had nearly a 20% gain from our entry 15 days prior. We decided to remove the remaining shares **(5)**. In a note to subscribers, we acknowledged the stock may have more room to run. But the market was a concern. It had six days up in a row and a rise that looked too fast following its steep decline.


Over the next two days the market continued into new high ground but then [reversed](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) sharply March 13. Fibria Celulose, saw one extra day of gains before it topped **(6)**. Did we leave profits on the table? Sure. But, we also avoided a 10% drop in a single day **(7)**. Overstaying your welcome, just slightly, wiped out all the progress and then some.


The result of this swing trade led to strong profits in February and March for SwingTrader. The S&P 500, by contrast, posted losses both months. The nimbleness of taking profits when you have them led to strong outperformance.

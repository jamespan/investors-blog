Many disciplines require a set of rules to follow to avoid danger. A pilot goes through a routine checklist before takeoff and police officers have protocol for entering a building with unknown risks. [Swing traders](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) should also employ rules to protect themselves from market corrections and the loss of capital.




 Staying in phase with the market is an important theme but many times sell rules in your individual stocks will act as an early warning. On Jan. 26, [this column](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-profits-not-created-equal-in-all-markets/) referred to the extended nature of the market. Sell rules had dropped the number of active trades on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) from six down to two from the beginning of the month. Most of the selling rules employed were [profit-taking rules](http://Taking Profits Early Is A Key Tenet Of Swing Trades), and the two remaining stocks exited the following week with profits.


It was unknown at the time of the article that would be the top day preceding a 10%-plus correction. But, it's funny that when you're diligently following rules you seem to naturally get out at opportune times. While stocks came off due to selling rules, new names didn't replace them. The extended nature of most stocks at the time provided few sound setups. Remaining unscathed by the correction resulted in a year-to-date win rate staying high at 62% with the average winner at 5.3% and average loser at 1.5%.


Was there opportunity to [make money on the downside](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/you-dont-need-stocks-to-go-up-to-profit/) by shorting stocks? Not likely. Before the correction picked up steam, there was the danger that a V-shaped pattern could form. Much of 2017 saw drops of 3% quickly recovering to new highs. If you short too early, you can easily find yourself going against traffic. Once the selling accelerated, shorting was still risky. It increased the likelihood of a bounce, which we saw on Tuesday. Better to preserve capital than to try and force low-probability trades to work.


When the market is in transition, [remaining on the sidelines](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/this-old-adage-rings-true-for-sideways-markets/) is usually the best course of action. But you can use a "test" trade to stay engaged with the market. Risk is limited with most of your portfolio still in cash. That was our strategy with **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)).


The market rebound on Tuesday opened the possibility the market could get back to new highs, repeating its behavior of 2017. Lululemon was already on SwingTrader as a watch list stock and its price action showed strength along with the market **(1)**. We started with a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/howvolatile-swing-trade-started-at-half-position/) early in the next trading session as the stock followed up on its reversal **(2)**. If this were to start a move in the market, we wanted to have a jump-start in deploying cash.


We followed up with the second half as we made progress on our initial position. With just one stock as an active trade, we weren't risking much to the portfolio. Our choice of stock reflected group strength in retail and apparel and a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) achieving new highs **(3)**.


As it played out, the market had a bearish reversal to finish the day that pushed Lululemon below our entry price by the close. After a brief push to new highs the next day, the stock reversed and undercut its entry day low at 78.65 and exited SwingTrader **(4)**. It was a loss, but not hesitating saved us from losing an extra 2.2% on the trade by the day's close.  Additionally, [taking a small loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-stock-losses-protects-portfolio/) on a single holding left you with significant outperformance versus the market. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite lost nearly 4% on the day and weakened from there.

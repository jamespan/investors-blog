While [swing traders](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) tend to be more active, a key factor to success is knowing when to sit on your hands. Most traders don't realize it, or they fight the reality, that it's OK to have cash as the largest position in your portfolio.


The last few months of trading on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) is a good case in point. July saw 14 out of 20 days with at least one name on the current trades list and as many as four. The month started weak but quickly picked up the pace as the Nasdaq composite bounced off its 50-day moving average line. A nice run-up on the index saw 13 out of 14 days up until the July 27 drop **(1)** shook us out of all our positions. Profit-taking on the way up helped secure a strong batting average despite the losses at the end.


August was a different story. Only eight out of 23 days had any names on the list and, even then, it was usually only one name at a time. Trades were initiated on Aug. 2 **(2)**, Aug. 16 **(3)**, and Aug. 22 **(4)**, and all three were closed for a loss after holding them just a few days. The activity may have elicited a big yawn but that's preferable to losing money needlessly. Plus, the Market Action on SwingTrader was sideways for most of the month and that by itself often suggests less trading and smaller position sizes.


Trading picked up at the end of August as we added two names, **ON Semiconductor** ([ON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ON)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), while the Nasdaq showed renewed vigor **(5)**. We captured gains on both and the action led to more trading. You don't want to increase your exposure until you start having success. The current trades list went to three on Sept. 11 **(6)** and as high as five, while the batting average continued to improve to 86% for the month. It's also noteworthy that the Russell 2000 was really the driving force behind much of the gains.


Even that run wasn't without its trials. We were back at zero names on Sept. 25 after protecting profit in our remaining stocks **(7)**. As the Nasdaq fell back to its 50-day moving average, we were expecting more of a correction, if not in depth then through time. Instead, the index quickly snapped back on Sept. 27 **(8)** and was back to new highs two days later **(9)**. It was a little tougher going, though, as the Russell 2000 started to flatten out due to some sector rotation. But make no mistake: Sitting through August with a mostly cash position was key. It retained the majority of gains from July and put us in a better position to take advantage of September.

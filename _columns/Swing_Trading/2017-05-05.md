A lot can change in a short period with a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategy. Two weeks ago, the market was at an inflection point that pushed the major indexes from apathy to brief elation after the first round of French elections. Now the world awaits the results from the final round of elections, so preparations should be made for your next moves.


First, it's worth reiterating the market's importance in how you approach your individual trades. Two weeks prior, [this column](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/has-the-market-gotten-past-the-speed-bumps/) referred to cautious optimism after nearly two months of sideways action. A sideways trend can be the most frustrating to contend with, and usually smaller positions and fewer trades are preferable.


Often you'll see your [batting average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/) start to dip giving you an additional metric, along with the market action, to suggest more judicious trading. On IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), the batting average of the last 10 trades dipped below 50% during the sideways market, leading to fewer positions being initiated. That batting average quickly improved the last couple weeks with four positive trades in a row.


It should also be noted that unless a downtrend can get firmly established, caution needs to be applied on both sides. A couple short trades were tried on SwingTrader as a downward bias appeared, but a rally in retail ended the trades with mixed results. A sideways market can cut you both ways.


Going forward, a survey of the differences in the indexes could prove useful. The Nasdaq showed a strong breakout to new highs April 24. While the S&P 500 was up significantly as well, it didn't make as much progress and has traded tightly since April 25.


Late Friday, the S&P broke above recent resistance near 2400. But volume limped in lower, making the move questionable. Look for additional gains in heavier volume next week. The Dow Jones industrial average has a similar look with resistance just above 21,000.


Small caps, as represented by the Russell 2000, have been more of a mixed bag. After making new highs on April 25, the index drifted lower and now stands below that breakout. It's also come back to its flattened 50-day moving average and has fallen below its short-term 10-day moving average line.


The action of the indexes in relation to each other can reveal sector rotation as well. If a divergence emerges and becomes more pronounced, you might need to change the pond in which you're fishing. That's where the nimbleness of a swing trader can take advantage of change for better performance.

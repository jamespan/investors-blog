An undercurrent of fear pervades the stock market. China tariff battles, recession fears and inverted yield curves have all made investors nervous.


Skittish investors will typically flock to safe havens such as gold, which has long been seen as a hedge against a stock market correction. But having the qualities of a hedge and a growth stock was something that really set Kirkland Lake Gold stock apart.




Kirkland Lake Gold Stock: A Hybrid Of Growth And Safety
-------------------------------------------------------


**Kirkland Lake Gold** ([KL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KL)) might not be the image that comes to mind when thinking of a growth stock. But in the two years since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, its stock has jumped nearly fivefold. It's not just about the rise in gold prices as protection from market volatility. There is also the Canadian miner's production efficiency that has captured investors' attention. Just look at the effect on the bottom line.


Each of the last 14 quarters show at least 25% earnings growth, and nearly half sported triple-digit growth. The revenue growth shows a similar story. And the production gains have just added to management's Midas touch.


An Upside Reversal At The 50-day Line
-------------------------------------


We added Kirkland Lake Gold stock to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) on Aug. 19 as it showed a classic reversal off its 50-day line **(1)**. It showed a wide spread, the distance from the high to the low, and an outside day where the highs and lows engulf the previous day's trading range. It also closed high in its trading range for the day. Our entry was at 44.89, just as the stock topped the previous day's high.


Deciding on your [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/) is always a little bit of a balancing act. If you put the stop loss too tight, you increase the risk of being shaken out. Too loose, and you expose yourself to a larger loss. In this case, we used the low of the entry day for Kirkland Lake Gold stock. That was larger than our normal 3%. With a larger stop loss, you can always reduce your risk with a smaller position size.


In this case, it wasn't necessary. Kirkland Lake Gold stock climbed and by the end of the week we reached our 5% profit goal **(2)** as the stock market dived on trade war escalation. We took half profits and raised our stop to 1% profit from our entry. There was no reason to let the trade go negative after having such a solid gain. Plus, the weak move on the market coupled with a strong move for Kirkland Lake pushed the relative strength line to new highs well before the stock hit price highs **(2)**.


Sell Or Hold?
-------------


The gains didn't stop there as our 10% profit goal hit a couple of days later **(3)**. We usually take the opportunity to sell the remaining shares on the way up. But this stock had the potential for further growth so we held out for more.The uncertainty in the stock market still had the potential to raise the price of gold. That would benefit pretty much all the gold stocks. Kirkland Lake Gold stock could also still cater to growth investors even if the market improved.


Unfortunately, that's not how it played out over the next few days. As trade-war fears dialed down, many of the gold stocks lost their luster. Kirkland Lake reversed in a bearish way as it crossed above 50 and then reversed lower **(4)**. When the weakness continued the next day, we removed the stock as it started trading below its five-day moving average line **(5)**. Usually we would wait for a close below the line as our sell trigger. Here, we just wanted to lock in as much of the gain as we could to close out the month.

In reading about [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), you might notice we often revisit the same stocks. That was the case with two recent trades in MSCI stock. Both trades ended early due to limited movement to the upside, but they both delivered profits.




Swing Trading Example: MSCI Stock
---------------------------------


One setup for **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) this year was in line with a market reversal. May 4 saw the Nasdaq undercut its previous day's low and then move up strongly. MSCI stock showed similar action, though the spread between the high and low was small **(1)**. On classic reversals, you usually get a wider spread. Still, the support at the 21-day line was compelling as it formed a short handle on a cup formation.


MSCI stock joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) the next day as the strength continued **(2)**. A powerful move often follows such a setup; otherwise the stock will need more time to consolidate the gains. In this case, MSCI stock looked like it needed more time and so we exited the trade a few days later **(3)**. We were [selling into strength](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-into-strength-can-maximize-profit-in-swing-trades/) in a lot of positions at that point, such as the subject of a previous column, **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)). While MSCI stock wasn't doing anything wrong it wasn't providing the expected power either. We exited with a 1.3% profit.

Sometimes They Go Higher; Sometimes They Go Lower
-------------------------------------------------


It's not our favorite outcome but in swing trading it happens often. You exit a position and the stock pops without you. MSCI stock had a strong move over the next couple days, but it wasn't all rosy. It got weaker before it got stronger, pulling back below our entry. Then after it started moving, it quickly reversed lower **(4)**. While we left money on the table, it wasn't easy money to capture.


MSCI stock drifted lower after its May 12 high and eventually found [support at the 50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/) **(5)**. It offered a new setup and MSCI stock joined SwingTrader again. This time, it was at a lower price than our previous entry **(2)**. We added it as it crossed above the previous day's high, which made it an outside day. The stock moved strongly to the close and the next day it held the strong gains.


But then we had another performance issue. After a brief move higher, MSCI stock seemed to lose steam. Again, though it wasn't doing anything wrong, we decided to just take the quick gain of 2.5% **(6)**.


It didn't move up that much after our exit, but we did avoid the dramatic fall on Thursday **(7)**. We were caught by surprise on the weakness in the market. But one of the benefits of selling into strength is that you will sometimes be lightening up when these days inevitably happen.

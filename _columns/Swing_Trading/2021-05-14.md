If you haven't realized it yet, this year is different from last year. Growth and technology have struggled while economic recovery plays have outperformed. Commodity stocks in particular have been an area of strength and STLD stock recently produced a perfect [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) setup.




Commodity Plays Find Traction
-----------------------------


If one looked at the best performers on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) this year, you might not realize we're typically growth-oriented. Our top, and often repeat, performers include heavy construction, oil, mining stocks and other commodity plays. [There's certainly the macroeconomic factors to consider.](https://www.investors.com/news/mining-stocks-how-copper-the-red-metal-is-becoming-the-green-metal/) But for **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STLD)), as is often the case for swing trading, the technical action caught our attention.


STLD stock traded tightly for numerous weeks while getting support at its 21-day moving average line. We patiently watched it consolidate. Once it broke above its tight area, a slight downtrend even, we added it to SwingTrader **(1)**. The relative strength line moved to new highs **(2)** along with the price. That's a telltale sign of winning stocks.

Our biggest issue was that the move was so powerful, it seemed like it was getting away from us. Using the low of our entry day seemed too tight. The low of the previous day was too large a risk at 5.4%. Our compromise? We reduced our risk by reducing our position size.


Taking Profits Early In STLD Stock
----------------------------------


The gains came quickly and steadily for STLD stock. We took our first third profit the day after our entry with over a 3% gain **(3)**. There was one down day where STLD stock closed below its five-day moving average line **(4)** but that was more a function of the line moving up sharply with tight action following the strong move up. It immediately responded with another strong day where we took another third profit **(5)**.


Just a few days later **(6)**, we were up over 15% from our entry in under two weeks time. We had nine out of 10 days up in a row. And looking at historic moves for STLD stock, we realized the action was unusual. However, given the strength, we noted to subscribers that it could be kept as a position trade.


In hindsight, our exit might seem too early given that Steel Dynamics continued higher **(7)**. But nailing the top exactly doesn't happen often. Plus, the action at the top was bearish with the downside reversal. It should also be noted that just two days later **(8),** STLD stock was right back to our exit. It looks like it got support at its 10-day moving average line this week and could move again. However, it wasn't much of a pullback to justify a new entry.

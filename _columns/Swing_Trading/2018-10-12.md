When the stock market direction changes for the worse, what do you do? Panic? Cry? Or can you look at it as a dispassionate observer?


The latter is certainly easier when you aren't hemorrhaging money. But at some point, you need to take what you can learn from any stock market direction change so that you can apply rules for the next time and formulate a market outlook. You only get better with experience if you learn from your experience. Here's how IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) handled the latest change in stock market direction. It's not always easy to get the stock market direction right but it's critical.




Just to set the stage, the 50-day moving average line contained nearly all the move of the Nasdaq composite since May. After a strong August performance in the index, the stock market set up for another move **(1)**. It quickly failed but still held above the 50-day moving average **(2)**. The index tried to right itself first with a weaker inside day **(3)**, where the highs and lows of the day are inside the previous day's highs and lows. These types of days generally don't give much information on direction until they break one way or another. But a stronger move followed a couple of days later **(4)** and we started to increase exposure.


On Sept. 21 we saw the first of a few [bearish reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(5)** on the Nasdaq composite. A bullish reversal **(6)** immediately followed, which prompted another round of buying starting with **CarGurus** ([CARG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CARG)). By Sept. 26, we had seven stocks as current trades when hit with another bearish reversal **(7)**. By taking half profits on the way up in stocks like **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) and **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)), we were already reducing exposure. A more [detailed analysis of the Trade Desk trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/) was in last week's column.


Stock Market Direction Turns Ugly
---------------------------------


[Profit taking](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/take-profits-swing-trades-extended-market-westlake-chemical-stock/) and [loss cutting](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-early-new-relic-stock/) left us with only two stocks by the time another bearish reversal **(8)** on Oct. 1. Not only were the current trades triggering sell signals, but leading stocks as a whole were coming under pressure. The Nasdaq composite, which led most of the year, continued to see a [falling relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) **(8)**. Taken together, there were early warning signs that the rally's advance might be over, starting with the Nasdaq composite. The unanswered question was how much of a correction to expect.


By the time selling pressure intensified on Oct. 4, our only stock was **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) and that fell off that day **(9)**. While the Nasdaq composite fell another 8%, we sat on the sidelines. It might be reminiscent of the cowardly [Shakespeare character Falstaff](https://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-quotes/better-part-valor-discretion), but it's hard to argue that sometimes discretion is the better part of valor in saving your money.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Precedents offer clues and guidance. Here's how IBD's SwingTrader viewed the [correction in February](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) and the precedents we used at that time.*

That mindset may continue for a few reasons. We've had a vertical violation of the 50- and 200-day moving average lines. Usually, such violent selling takes some time to resolve itself. While that resolution occurs, progress is often difficult as profits come and go quickly. Normally, [bullish reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-reversal-day-market-trend/) in the stock market are great opportunities for swing trades. But that's usually with pullbacks in a strong uptrending stock market. That could still be the case here, but the 5-, 10- and 50-day moving averages are in sharp declines. A confirmation of the strength, with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/), offers more confidence. But even that might be short-lived. The 200-day line will be the first area of resistance to overcome followed by the 50-day moving average line. The stock market direction could remain cloudy if it just bounces back and forth between the two.


Using Precedents For Stock Market Direction
-------------------------------------------


The past often offers guidance to potential scenarios unfolding. Right now, the [rally in February 2018](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) might be instructive. It had a vertical violation and quickly showed a follow-through day. We pounced on the opportunities but quickly took profits on the way up. The stock market hitting new highs that quickly was suspicious. At that time, we used a [market bottom in 2016 as a precedent](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-look-to-past/). While the precedents offers guidance, it doesn't mean you can just go on autopilot with your trading. You still need to observe when there's a divergence from the precedents and react accordingly. History may repeat itself, but not always in the same way.

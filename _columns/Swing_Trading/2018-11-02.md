It's nice to get gains when trading stocks. Keeping the gains while you have them is not so easy. But if you swing trade stocks, you might find a rule-based approach makes it easier to keep your profits while at the same time reducing losses. Here's how.




First, it requires a change in mindset. Many investors dream of their stocks rocketing to huge gains. They are after the double, triple or the elusive 10-bagger. It can take years to develop those types of gains and they are certainly rare. When you swing trade stocks, you look for much smaller gains. How often do you see stocks go up 5% to 10% in just a couple of weeks? All the time. If you play enough of them in a year, those small gains can compound into large profits. You also can reduce risk by cutting losses much quicker on stocks you swing trade while avoiding less-favorable markets.


Swing Trade Stocks By Taking Profits On The Way Up
--------------------------------------------------


September offered a number of opportunities to swing trade stocks that worked out well. By taking profits on the way up two benefits occur. First, it protects gains in your individual stocks. Second, you might find yourself naturally pushed out of the market. **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) stock is one of the swing-trade stocks of September that demonstrates the benefits of the strategy. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as it bounced strongly from its 50-day moving average to a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/breakouts-buying-stocks-swing-trades/) **(1)**. Our entry of 51.84 was well before the traditional entry at 53.51. That extra profit cushion comes in handy for later sell decisions in your swing trades. The increased [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-clues-complement-price-action-for-stocks/) also confirmed the strength of the move in Planet Fitness stock.


By the next day, we were at our first price target of a 5% gain **(2)**. We often take half profits at this level when we swing trade stocks and this case was no different. Another useful rule is to [raise our stop-loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) to the 1% profit level after we capture early profits. A quick move up can fall back to earth just as quickly. By raising your stop-loss as you go along, you protect profits and [prevent a good trade from going bad](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/). You also still have some exposure to capture more gains if the move continues.


Selling Rules Kept Profits, Avoided Correction
----------------------------------------------


Taking half profits at 5% was a matter of following a clear-cut rule. The day also showed a potential early warning sign that can be easy to miss. Though the day closed positive, it was still a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(2)**. The bearish reversal doesn't necessarily demand a sell, but it should get your attention and prepare you for action. When you swing trade stocks, time is a vital component. Bearish reversals often precede short-term weakness.


In this case, it marked a short-term top. Planet Fitness stock kept inching down and eventually triggered our raised stop-loss **(3)**. We had the sell rule in place with the raised stop, so thinking about it wasn't necessary. We exited the rest of our position with about a 4% gain for the entire trade in just a week's time. If you can swing trade stocks like that enough times in a year, those 4% gains can turn into a great year — if you keep your losses small when you are wrong.


Planet Fitness stock got much worse over the next week. It turned negative the day after we removed it from our current trades list **(4)**. Less than two weeks later, it was more than 18% off its high. We avoided all the destruction in the individual stock [as well as the market](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-bearish-market-outlook/). Due to sell rules, the list of stocks on SwingTrader dwindled quickly from seven stocks on Sept. 26 to just one stock by the end of Oct. 2. Our activity was notably less throughout the month, but a flat month is far better than what most portfolios and indexes saw in October. If the current rally holds, we're left in a much better position to take advantage of it.

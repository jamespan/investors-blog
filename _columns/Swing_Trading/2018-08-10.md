If you can get market direction right you can significantly improve the success rate of your [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). If you can get it right early, that's even better. A stock market reversal day, just like reversal days in individual stocks, can keep you abreast of short-term trend changes. With that knowledge, you can stay alert for opportunities at these inflection points for greater profits.




Context matters. When looking for a bullish market reversal day, it's important to keep in mind what kind of correction preceded it. Was it a mild pullback in an overall uptrend? Or a bounce after a more serious bear market correction? With a more serious correction, you might need more work in individual stock setups before taking action. If an uptrend is already in place, the opportunity for new short-term swing trades might unfold sooner.


Stock Market Reversal Day Starts July Rally
-------------------------------------------


Take two recent pullbacks in the Nasdaq composite. With the index up around 14% for the year, a clear uptrend is in place. But that didn't happen in a straight line. In June, the index saw a 5% pullback to its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/). The reversal started with a down day on June 27 **(1)**. The next day, the weakness continued but support came in right at the 50-day line **(2)**. That pushed the index to positive territory by the end of the day and established a market reversal day. The undercut of the previous day provided a final shakeout of weaker holders before the buyers came in. A breach below the low of the market reversal day is a clear indication of a rally failure. It lets you know the stock market has more work to do to correct itself.


But was the reversal enough strength for a buy? Not quite. The gains only recovered about half the drop from the down day **(1)**. A clear close above the high of the reversal day **(2)** would give you more confidence. The market tried the next day but retreated below the reversal day high. The following session sold off hard in the morning before firming in the afternoon and closing above the reversal day. Now you could start looking for buys, though [volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) was missing in many prospects due to the mid-week holiday. The tide didn't truly turn until July 6, and prompted IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) to switch its market action to uptrend **(3)**. (On the flip side, be aware of [bearish market reversal days.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) They are a signal for potential short-term market tops.)


Inside Days Don't Tell You Much, The Confirmation Does
------------------------------------------------------


The Nasdaq went to all-time highs over the next couple weeks before pulling back to its 50-day moving average again. This time, the index closed below the line **(4)** after a quick three-day drop. The market reversal day that followed was what's known as an inside day **(5).** That's where the high and low of the day are within the trading range of the previous day's high and low. Inside days are not a great indicator of direction. (Check out this [example of a powerful outside day](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/reversal-days-swing-trading-buy-points/) in **Match Group** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) as a contrast to the tentativeness of the inside day.) Again, it was better to wait until the index could get back above a logical area of resistance. The day prior to the market reversal day was that line in the sand **(4)**.


The Nasdaq composite rose above that level on Aug. 2 and we moved the market action on SwingTrader back to uptrend **(6)**. Keep in mind, this is just one part of the equation for your portfolio. Usually, a stock market reversal is great, but if individual stocks don't show any setups, you might remain sitting on your hands. If the setups are there, the market reversal day can spur you to action sooner.

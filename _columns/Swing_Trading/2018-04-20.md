A key part of a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategy is how it minimizes losses in stock market corrections. But you also need nimbleness to get back in quickly when the market turns. Otherwise your performance can lag.




This most recent correction in March started with little exposure in IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). Taking profits on the way up left us in cash at the Nasdaq composite's closing high on March 12 **(1)**. We tried a trade in **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) on March 14 **(2)** when the market was still close to its highs. We started scaling out the next day as the stock [reversed](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/).


After a quick drop in the market, we put **HubSpot** ([HUBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUBS)) on SwingTrader. It was only a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/). Though HubSpot was breaking out, the Nasdaq's rally attempt never cleared the high from two days earlier **(3)**, which made us cautious. HubSpot exited the same day, ahead of its stop loss, because it reversed from its highs. It was a rare day-trading example for SwingTrader, but the negative action spurred us to protect capital.


The Nasdaq composite had a more powerful rally attempt on March 26 **(4)**. This time, the index was up over 3% and cleared the previous day's high. A spike in the [Cboe Market Volatility Index](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-the-vix-can-help-confirm-market-bottoms/), otherwise known as the VIX, also suggested a possible short-term bottoming signal. [IBD's Psychological Market Indicators](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) page shows this signal's history for the past year.


We tried **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) that day because of its relative strength at the time. Whereas the Nasdaq fell below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), Netflix was well above its 50-day line. But this didn't pan out either. As the market and the stock reversed, we started scaling out of the Netflix position early in the day and removed the remaining shares at day's end.


The Nasdaq had another rally attempt that failed quickly on March 29 **(5)**. **GoDaddy** ([GDDY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDDY)) joined for only a day. We didn't wait for the stop loss and removed the stock as it and the market both showed bearish reversals. The early removal kept the loss small at just over 1%.

It was four losses in a row, but the damage was minimal. First, each purchase was one at a time and HubSpot was only a half position. Second, we cut losses quickly, averaging less than a 2% loss for each trade. That would keep the hit to your portfolio well under a half percent per trade. The Nasdaq by contrast fell 10.9% during that time.


Applying Three Waves Down To Swing Trading Strategy
---------------------------------------------------


One of the psychological aspects of markets is a tendency to find success on the third try. It's a pattern that repeats itself. Often these waves down can last weeks or months. In the swing trading strategy, time is condensed and focused more on days.


This latest third rally attempt began on April 3 **(6)** after another VIX spike suggested a short-term bottom. This time the Nasdaq had more substance to its pullback, with more than a 10% drop from its high. While the index gained 1% on this first day, it was an inside day. That's where both the high and low fall inside the trading range of the previous day. They tend to be questionable signs of direction changes.


The following day, however, showed more power with a 1.5% jump on an outside day **(7)**. Both the high and low fell outside the previous day's trading range. The Nasdaq closed near its peak, and it broke above the high from two days prior. We started adding stocks to SwingTrader the next day.


The biggest headwinds have come from headlines, mostly on tariffs and fears of a trade war. Still, the Nasdaq staged a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) **(8)**, increasing the chances of the rally continuing, at least in the short term. The index poked its head above its 50-day line but closed the week back below it. Some retracement here wouldn't be unusual. The four names currently on SwingTrader held up through last week. Their performance this week will inform our market outlook and whether we'll need to go into defensive mode again.

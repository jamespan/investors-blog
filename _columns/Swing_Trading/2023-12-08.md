It's no big surprise that short-term moving averages are useful for short-term [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). Sure, you might get shaken out in a slight wiggle, but some of the best stocks can trend surprisingly long. Here's how short-term moving averages helped capture a sizable gain in MELI stock.




Swing Trading Example: MELI Stock
---------------------------------


**MercadoLibre** ([MELI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MELI)) has often been referred to as the **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) or **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) of Latin America. And it's had a long-term rise to deserve the comparison.


As MELI stock came down along with most growth stocks, it had a sharp change of character after its last earnings report **(1)**. That sent the stock back above its 50-day moving average, breaking a two-month downtrend. The move also coincided with the Nov. 1 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/).


We increased our exposure by over 25% on that day, so we didn't venture into MELI stock then. But it gave us another chance.


A short pause allowed the 10-day moving average line to catch up to the price action. The stock price and short-term moving average line eventually met up **(2)**. With a stock that's been running for a while, a pullback to the 10-day line isn't usually enough to entice us as a setup. But MELI stock was just getting comfortable back above its 50-day line and wasn't wildly extended above it.

On Nov. 14, a [tame inflation report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/tame-cpi-inflation-in-october-puts-sp-500-rally-back-in-gear/) sent interest rates tumbling and stocks soaring. It was the catalyst we were waiting for in the setup, and MELI stock joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day **(3)**.


From that add, it held its five-day moving average line remarkably well.


Selling Into Strength
---------------------


While a trending stock is always a good thing to have in your portfolio, we are also mindful of keeping a swing-trading mentality. So we took our profits on the way up starting with trimming a third of the position with a 2.5% profit **(4)**. MELI stock just continued higher and continued to hold its five-day line.


A little over a week later we had a 10% profit from our entry **(5)**. MELI stock started to look extended, with a distance of 22% above its 50-day moving average line. It was only 6% above the 50-day line at our entry.


We locked in another third of the position that day. Meanwhile, MELI stock continued to get support at its five-day line, and we would also note areas that it would revisit or hover around like the 1575 level at the end of November **(6)**.


Our Final Exit
--------------


Our final exit came as MercadoLibre fell below the 1575 level of short-term support **(7)**. It had already breached the five-day moving average line the day before, though not by more than 1%. Market indexes also saw downside reversals, which permeated the look of a lot of stocks.


As MELI stock challenged its 10-day moving average, and market indexes got weaker, it was enough for us to lock in our remaining position. The end result was a 7.7% gain for the trade in two weeks.

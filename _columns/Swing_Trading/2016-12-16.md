A stock you've been watching is up sharply in the morning but its gains are making you hesitate. What if the stock can't maintain the gains and you get caught in a normal pullback? What if you don't buy and the stock just keeps on moving up without you?


Starting with a half position can be a strategic compromise that offers a solution. A [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategy poses unique challenges when scaling into positions. Smaller position sizes could mean commissions take a bigger bite out of your trade percentage wise. However, there are still benefits that should not be ignored and can easily outweigh the costs.


The fear of a pullback is lessened with a half position since your portfolio would only suffer half the harm. The fear of missing out is alleviated since your starting position at least puts you in the game. If the stock gets even more extended, you can still finish the position with another buy knowing you've already established some profit cushion due to the lower cost purchase. If the stock closes well, you can also use that as feedback that the stock is holding its gains and finish buying the position.


This strategy can be especially useful when the market is in transition. Stocks may move up sharply due to news. Presidential election results and the "Brexit" vote are two examples from this year where the strategy could have proved useful.


Recently, IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) added the half-position strategy to its product. On Dec. 14, **Akamai Technologies** was added with a half position **(1)** as the stock made a ten-day high shortly after the open. At the time it was put on, volume was tracking at its heaviest in a month and the stock was already up more than 4%. The move followed positive action in the tech indexes from the prior day when the Nasdaq composite pushed into new highs and the Nasdaq 100 [broke out](http://education.investors.com/lesson.aspx?id=736311&sourceid=735787).


Rather than take an all or nothing approach, a half position was taken at 67.85 as a compromise. The stock moved up slightly afterward but then shed more than a percent off its gains. A full position wasn't warranted given the weakness into the close.


As it stands, the stock keeps getting just above 68 and then getting turned away. If it can surpass that area of resistance, preferably with confirming volume, the position can be finished with a purchase of another half position. If the stock gets stuck and can't make progress, an exit would leave you with a loss half as large.

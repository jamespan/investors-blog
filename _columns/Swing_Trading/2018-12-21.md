With the Nasdaq composite hitting [bear market territory](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bears-nasdaq/), the temptation to go into hibernation is strong. If you raised cash in time, you've avoided heartache but might be getting bored with the lack of opportunities. If you've sat with positions, you may be losing hope at recovering the money lost. What's an investor to do?




[Looking to past](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-look-to-past/) bear markets can be a useful exercise. If you are new to the investing game, then welcome to what might be your first bear market. A look back in time can provide you a road map for how to navigate the tumultuous terrain. For those with more experience, this might be a refresher and a chance to play things better or repeat previous success.


In either case, a bear market is a normal, useful part of the stock market cycle. It helps clear the decks and reallocate money into new promising industries and stocks. It's economist Joseph Schumpeter's idea of creative destruction played out in real time. Old leaders fall apart, sometimes never coming back. In their place come fresh early-stage bases to offer new opportunities for profit. That was how things played out in 2011.


The Bear Market Of 2011
-----------------------


One of the toughest things about the current market environment is the headlines. [Trade war fears with China](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-rate-hike-bear-market-trump-china-trade-deal/), [Fed monetary policy, and President Donald Trump locking horns with Congress](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/dow-jones-falls-bear-market-trump-government-shutdown-fed-doubts/) are just a taste of current worries.


In 2011, headlines wreaked havoc as well. [China was seeing slower growth and a real estate bubble](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/china-wont-ease-for-now-despite-u-s-europe-woes/). European Central Bank action was top of mind as [debt crisis spread in the euro zone and sparked fears of a global recession](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/europe-hurt-us-stock-funds-in-2011/). The negativity culminated in a 20% drop in the Nasdaq composite on Oct. 4, officially a bear market **(1)**. Though it only spent about less than 10 minutes under that 20% level, a wise investor knows to ignore the headlines and rely on market action for clues on re-entry.


Our preferred signal that a bear market is turning toward an uptrend is the [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/). It proved elusive at first in the 2011 bear market. A couple days of strong price action **(2) (3)** didn't have the required trading volume to qualify. Price and volume action meshed on Oct. 18 to signal a follow-through day **(4)**, but it didn't last. Despite multiple attempts above the 200-day moving average line **(5)** the subsequent quick pullbacks stunted progress. It brings up an important point. Don't plunge all your money in right at the signal. Instead, start with a few positions and allow the stock market to tell you when you should put more money to work. How do you know when? It's when you're [making progress on your positions](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/) and the sound setups keep coming.


Follow-Through Day In 2011 Starts Powerful Stock Market Rally
-------------------------------------------------------------


In this case, distribution put the rally to an end and a cautious approach avoided damage. But it wasn't long before a new rally attempt started on Nov. 28 with a 3.5% gain **(6).** On Dec. 20, the Nasdaq composite staged a follow-through day **(7)**. Coming on the 17th day might seem late, but isn't without precedence. Investors' focus might have been turned toward Christmas shopping instead of investing. It just goes to show that the transition from bear market to new uptrend can happen anytime.


From the follow-through day's close, the Nasdaq composite saw a 20% gain in just three months time. If you thought sleeping through it or waiting for negative headlines to subside was the way to go, you would be late to the party. The setups and opportunities unfolded rapidly in the early weeks, as they often do. Instead of disengaging, keep updated [watch lists](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/watch-list-keeps-you-engaged-in-tough-markets/) of stocks showing [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). That prepares you for whenever the next rally comes.

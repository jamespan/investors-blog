Earnings reports and initial public offerings both offer fantastic opportunities for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). Putting them together can be even more powerful as a recent trade in CrowdStrike stock demonstrates.


Swing Trading Example: CrowdStrike Stock
----------------------------------------


**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) had its IPO on June 12 **(1)**. That was just days after the June 7 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-find-next-stock-market-bottom/). Its industry group, computer software security, is one of the hottest groups of the year with a helping hand from a strong market uptrend.


After a quick run up to 79, the cybersecurity stock started to form its first base **(2)**. We added CrowdStrike stock to the watchlist of [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on July 18 with its earnings report due after the market close **(3)**. The base was only a month long but [IPO bases can be shorter](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/strong-ipo-bases-tend-to-feature-numerous-high-closes-by-the-stock/).


[CrowdStrike topped earnings and revenue estimates and guided higher](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crowdstrike-earnings-crwd-stock-q12019/). While not profitable, the cybersecurity stock has triple-digit revenue growth, a hallmark of many strong IPO stocks. With demand for shares high, and a low supply of 20 million shares in its float, that can setup an explosive move. This was one of the topics of a recent [Investing With IBD Podcast](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/beyond-meat-stock-ipo-stocks/) on IPO opportunities.


In after-hours trading, CrowdStrike stock was up big. We waited to see how it traded at the market open. After a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/twitter-stock-earnings-breakaway-gap/), the cybersecurity stock pulled back and never challenged its initial highs at 85.85 for the rest of the day **(4)**. We waited for further strength to trigger the stock.


Locking In Gains For Cybersecurity Stock
----------------------------------------


The next day **(5),**as the stock passed 85.85, we triggered the stock on SwingTrader. Our stop was at the entry day low. A breach of that level would suggest the stock needed to consolidate its huge gains with some sideways movement. A brief pullback didn't hit our stop and three days later and CrowdStrike was at 5% profit **(6)**. As usual, we took half profits and [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry.


The following day started strong and CrowdStrike stock nearly hit our 10% profit goal. It pulled back and closed in the bottom third of its trading range but still in positive territory for the day **(7)**. The next day software stocks took a beating and CrowdStrike was not spared **(8).**[It sliced through its 5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/). Rather than waiting for the stock to hit our raised stop, we removed CrowdStrike stock early to [preserve our gains](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/take-profits-early-regenexbio-stock/).


Since its removal, the cybersecurity stock found support at its 10-day moving average line day-after-day but did undergo a character change. The fairly orderly trading became more erratic as the stock continued to retrace its price discovery with wide trading ranges each day. Between [Fed policy](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/fed-meeting-fed-rate-cut-dow-jones-risk/) and [President Trump's tweets on tariffs](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/what-is-a-tariff/), volatility exploded in the market indexes. It's hard to time a proper entry or exit with such wild swings in such a short period of time. Avoid such behavior in stocks as much as possible.

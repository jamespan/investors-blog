Ted Williams famously articulated the science and stats behind his athletic success as a baseball player. Knowing what pitches to swing at — and which to avoid — was a key to Williams' batting average and eventual induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. As a swing trader, taking a similarly judicious approach to your trades can have its own rewards — a more profitable portfolio.


Correctly interpreting and following the current short-term trend in the market is a key tenet of a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) style. What happens when the trend becomes less apparent? That's when caution should reign. Keeping losses small is another crucial requirement of swing trading. Avoiding a loss altogether, by recognizing an unfavorable environment, gives you that much more profit from your winners. In other words, keep your eye on the ball, but don't always swing.


Portfolio profits are currently being plagued by a sideways trend and divergence between the Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000, adding an extra level of caution to our current approach. A strong market usually sees the two indexes rising together; one index may significantly outperform the other based on sector strength or bias toward large- or small-cap stocks. But, when the indexes start going in different directions, that can spell trouble.


The election results were an initial catalyst for the divergence **(1)**. The Trump win changed the calculation of stock values in many investors' minds. Small caps were presumed to be major beneficiaries of potentially less onerous regulations and favorable tax policy. Infrastructure sectors soared as did financials. The initial reaction certainly favored the Russell 2000, specifically made up of small-cap stocks and with a heavy weighting in financials. The Nasdaq, at first, lagged and even had some starkly negative days contrasting the Russell's move **(2)**. In November, the Russell 2000 was up an impressive 12% compared with just 3% for the Nasdaq.


The tables turned shortly after. The Russell's current peak **(3)** on Dec. 9 was followed by a break below its 5- and 10-day moving averages **(4)** on Dec. 22. It hasn't been able to recover above the lines for long and didn't participate as the Nasdaq started 2017 with a rally **(5)**.


The divergence led to uncertainty and as a result fewer names have been added to IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) in recent weeks. The names tried have struggled the past month, not to mention the countless ones that were avoided and ultimately failed. This week, steel stocks got a bump from statements by President Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, and then reversed. Financials started moving but couldn't follow through. Not swinging for these looks like a lack of action and isn't as exciting. However, it's preferable to losing money and saves your energy for when the better pitches come.

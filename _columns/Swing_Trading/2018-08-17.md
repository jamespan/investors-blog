Hindsight is a tricky thing. There are always those situations that you look back on and think, "I should have known that was going to happen." In a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), bearish reversal days often signal short-term weakness to come. It lets you know trouble could be coming and prepares you to take defensive action.




Take recent example **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)). It looked promising as it reported another quarter of triple-digit growth. That launched a strong move with confirming [volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) and a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) at new high ground on the day of the breakout **(1)**. It joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) and earned a spot as the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/stock-of-the-day-cf-industries-cf-stock-buy-zone-bullish-indicator/) the same day. The 12% move might seem excessive for a single day. But sometimes the best performers start dramatically, especially with a turnaround in earnings. Putting the stop at the entry day low would subject you to a larger risk percentage. We mitigated that risk by [altering our position size](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-calculator-swing-trading-tool/) to a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/).


Bearish Reversal Days Hit
-------------------------


The next day saw the first of a few bearish reversal days for CF **(2)**. The stock reached new highs intraday then closed in the lower part of its trading range. Usually weakness follows that kind of action, at least on a short-term basis. It's particularly worrisome when you see a lot of price discovery. That's when the bar from the high to low has a wider spread. Given the prior day's move, this day wasn't too bad. One could argue that at least it kept the bulk of its gains from the breakout.


But the bad behavior continued. Day after day CF Industries stock would open strong and close weak. Bearish reversal days suggest a lack of appetite for the stock at the higher price. It can be due to the stock itself or shifts in the general stock market. In this case the stock market, especially the Nasdaq composite, had its uptrend still intact from a [bullish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-reversal-day-market-trend/) the prior week. Progress was sluggish, though, after eight consecutive gains in the index.


On Aug. 8, CF industries [closed below its five-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/), though not decisively **(3)**. It still hadn't given away much ground from its breakout and we decided to give it a little more room to develop. Earnings gaps will often consolidate gains a few days before moving to new highs.


A strong move the following day justified our decision, but then the buying appetite waned again. The tally of bearish reversal days got another addition **(4)**. The morning activity saw a sharp move to new high ground above 50 and the gains dwindled away the rest of the day.


The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, gapped down on fears that [Turkey currency weakness](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/dollar-hits-high-trump-fed-hurt-turkey-emerging-markets/) left global investors exposed. At this point, we still had a gain in the stock but we prepared to cut quickly if the weakness continued.


The market continued to falter the next week, and CF Industries exited SwingTrader on Aug. 13 on a decisive close below its five-day moving average line **(5)**. It ended up as a small loss from our entry. It was even smaller due to the half position. But things got much worse over the next couple of days. The bearish reversal days helped put us in the right frame of mind for defense. They warned that despite our earlier enthusiasm, the short-term trend wasn't favorable. The early warning makes your decision easier when the time comes to sell. Hopefully, you'll be less likely to fall victim to another "should have known" situation.

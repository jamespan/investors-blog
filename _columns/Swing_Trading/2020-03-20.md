There's been a lot of destruction due to the [coronavirus stock market crash](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/). But at some point, it will be time to take advantage of the upside. [Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) can often give you an early edge while still minimizing risk for rally failures.




Protecting Our Swing Trading Gains
----------------------------------


Year to date, [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) is looking at a [superior edge over the S&P 500](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bear-market-swing-trading-strategy/). [Locking in profits on the way up](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-profits-early-is-a-key-tenet-of-swing-trades/) and reducing exposure near the market top **(1)** made all the difference. But the year isn't over and neither are the challenges. Should the stock market bounce strongly and start moving, we can quickly find ourselves losing ground due to light exposure. How do we find the balance in swing trading?


First, we are going in with an expectation based on historical precedent. The nature of how we sliced through the 50-day moving average line **(2)** was severe. These "vertical violations" usually require a few months before a rally recovery can truly take hold. We also expect that the first couple of follow-through days are more failure-prone. Because of our historical precedent of vertical violations, our swing trading exposure continues to remain light.


Test Trades On Rally Attempts
-----------------------------


Second, we still need the flexibility to start our participation as early as possible. If we see evidence of a market bounce, we want to start slowly building our exposure to participate. [Test trades](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/why-half-position-dominos-stock-made-swing-trading-sense/) help in that regard.

When the Nasdaq composite found support at its 200-day line **(3)**, it set up the potential for a short-term rally. The fourth day of the rally attempt **(4)** had many characteristics of a follow-through day, but not everything. It didn't have heavier volume than the previous day.


The next day, the index closed below the low of the previous day. It was an early warning the rally may be in trouble. Our minimal exposure was back at zero quickly and well before the rally day low **(3)** was undercut. That officially killed the rally attempt. With test trades you don't increase your exposure until you are proven right on your initial decisions. What does it mean to be proven right? You are making progress.


One Big Day Is Not Enough!
--------------------------


As the market continued down, we remained light in our swing trading. Don't feel like you need to be making money every week. Sometimes preserving capital is the best thing you can do for your portfolio. And don't get greedy when you see a single large day. You might feel like you are missing out on great gains but you are also most likely sitting out major losses.


On March 13 we saw the fifth largest percentage gain for the Nasdaq composite in its nearly 50-year history **(5)**. It was up 9.4%, but one big day is not enough. The biggest percentage gains are often surrounded by the worst days. Case in point, the Nasdaq had its worst day in its history the very next day with a 12.3% loss. It can feel like your swing trading will be left behind without action. But if you push too hard too soon, you'll find yourself dwindling your account.


What To Look For Now
--------------------


We are still looking for a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) and right now our rally remains intact. The low of March 18 hasn't been breached **(6)**. The positive close the next day served as Day 1 of our rally attempt **(7)**. If we get a follow-through day next week, we'll increase our swing trading exposure cautiously. However, aggressive buying is usually reserved for markets that are trending above their 21-day moving average lines. We are a long way from there. Exposure can remain light until we get there.

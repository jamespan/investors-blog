One of the best ways an investor can fix their problems with selling stocks is by buying stocks right in the first place. Buying [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) in [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) is a good place to start.




Buying Breakouts Example: Akamai Technologies
---------------------------------------------


**Akamai Technologies** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) formed a classic [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/) pattern in March and April and continued to consolidate in May. As a swing trade, it's nice to have the classic pattern but you can [accept shorter consolidations](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-stock-breakout-strategies-have-familiar-rules/). In this case, even the three weeks of the handle was an acceptable consolidation for a swing trade breakout.


For that three-week period, the area around 78 acted as resistance. The stock repeatedly came up to that level but fell back. Once Akamai stock crossed that area of resistance, it joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as a breakout **(1).** You want to see decisive action on your breakouts and Akamai stock didn't disappoint. The trading volume behind the move was more than double the average by the end of the day **(1)**. The relative strength line went into recent new high territory **(1)** along with the price, another good characteristic of successful breakouts.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *The biggest stock moves of each market cycle often start with breakouts.

That's why setting an appropriate [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) is important. Normally for our swing trades, we set a stop loss at the low of the breakout day. A drop below that level doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure, but the stock may need more consolidation time. For Akamai stock, a stop loss at the breakout day low was too tight, less than 1.5%. A stop that is too tight risks taking a loss at the slightest shakeout. In this case, we moved the stop loss to the low of the day prior to the breakout. That was a 3% risk percentage and more in line with most of our trades.


That extra room came in handy since Akamai stock did challenge the low of the breakout day the next session **(2)**. Two days later, it fell below the [5-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) and returned to the breakout day low before a strong reversal up **(3)**. The stop loss we chose still gave us protection but kept us in the stock. We also use the 5-day moving average as a stop loss but we use the close, not just a breach. That wiggle room also helped. A tighter stop, in either case, would have led to a loss and missing the subsequent move.


The Best Defense Is A Good Offense
----------------------------------


But what if you buy late or extended? That's where things can go awry. A higher price on the buy might make the tighter stop more attractive. After all, you still need to protect your capital. The entry day low could have easily been closer to 3% with a later buy from the breakout. The better price you get with your breakouts, the better your decision making for holding and selling stocks.


Because we held Akamai stock, we hit our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-into-strength-can-maximize-profit-in-swing-trades/) and took full profits **(4)**. Normally, we only take half profits at 5% but there were a couple of reasons for booking the full profits on this breakout stock. The trade was already in the higher range of holding time at two weeks and the market started to soften. Three days later and the stock closed below its 5-day moving average **(5)**. That was a final warning before the stock dropped more than 14% off its high **(6)**.


Proper sell rules are essential for holding a stock through normal gyrations. They balance protecting your portfolio from losses while remaining open to further profit opportunities. But you need to buy right from the start to keep the balance. Otherwise you end up risking more to gain less.

With [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), your normal holding period is usually a week or two. Your expectation is for a smaller, quicker gain. But what if you find yourself in a stock that has the potential to do more? Then you might consider switching your profit goals. In that case, your swing trading might turn into position trading, as **Zscaler** ([ZS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZS)) demonstrates.




Swing Trading Setup On Zscaler Earnings
---------------------------------------


Zscaler stock joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as a [watch list stock](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/consider-watch-lists-homework-that-pays-off/) ahead of earnings **(1)**. We don't want to initiate a position in something right before earnings. It's too risky for swing trading unless you are [using options to mitigate the risk](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/new-feature-on-ibds-swingtrader-gives-options-on-earnings/). Even with position trading, it's not something you generally want to do without already having a solid profit cushion. You are better off waiting until the earnings report is out.


Putting the cloud-based security software company on the watch list let our subscribers know this was a stock to keep an eye on the following morning. We noted that the current market environment had plenty of examples of [earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) acting as catalysts for big moves. Wait too long and you could miss the entire trade.


Other factors also told a compelling story for Zscaler stock. Initial public offerings, or IPOs, have a lot of potential. With position trading, if you look at the best performing stocks of each market cycle in the last 100 years, you'll see a large percentage had their IPOs within the last eight years before starting their huge rise. Specifically, IPOs with strong earnings and sales growth have the most potential. Zscaler stock already had more than 12 quarters of solid sales growth. It was turning a corner in earnings and finally translating the sales growth to profitability. As a swing trade we would accept a smaller profit but take it quickly vs. the longer time frame of position trading.


Starting Zscaler Stock With The Right Position Size
---------------------------------------------------


At the open after earnings, Zscaler vaulted more than 15% **(2)**. It quickly pulled back and so we didn't enter immediately. Thirty minutes into the trading session, Zscaler recovered above its open and we put it on as a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/). Why so tentative? A big gap like that can easily come in on you. But if you make your stop loss too tight, you increase the chance you'll get shaken out.


As a swing trade, we decided to limit our loss to the low of the day. That's more than a 6% risk percentage and more than we like for a swing trade. Hence, the half position. By reducing the [position size,](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sound-position-sizing-opens-door-to-powerful-stock-moves/) we can still participate in the trade but mitigate the risk to our portfolio.


Let's say you are aggressive with a normal position size of 20% of your overall portfolio. The half position reduces your portfolio risk from 1.3% to just 0.6%, assuming you take the full loss at the stop-loss price. A [position size calculator](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-calculator-swing-trading-tool/) can help you with the math to make your decisions.


Zscaler also sported a strong [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) breaking out into new high ground with the price and [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) well above its 50-day average **(2)**. Still, the stock reversed the next day **(3)** as the market started a minor pullback. We had a lack of progress for the rest of the week but it never breached the low of the entry day. On March 11, Zscaler stock roared back to life along with the stock market and hit our 5% profit goal **(4)**. Normally, we take half profits at the 5% profit goal and raise our stop to protect the profits. But since Zscaler was already a half position, we sent an alert to subscribers that we would extend our profit goal to 10%.


The next day, Zscaler hit its 10% profit goal and we took our profits **(5)**. Before we did, however, we sent a custom notification to subscribers with an alternate suggestion.


Subscriber Alert Suggests Position Trading
------------------------------------------


The alert sent to subscribers noted that even though it hit its 10% profit goal, Zscaler stock "might be one to consider turning from a swing trade to a position trade." The alert went on to explain that Zscaler was just out of a first-stage base and part of a leading industry group, computer security software. That also includes leaders like **CyberArk Software** ([CYBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CYBR)), **Palo Alto Networks** ([PANW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PANW)), **Proofpoint** ([PFPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFPT)) and **Check Point Software** ([CHKP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHKP)). It's a group that has a heavy weighting among [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/) stocks. Leaderboard focuses on position trading, and CyberArk and Zscaler are members of the current Leaders List.


In fact, Zscaler stock joined Leaderboard on the same day it joined SwingTrader **(2)**. Of course, the approach is different for the Leaderboard product. Though the stock is extended now, the profit cushion of 10% will help Leaderboard weather a normal pullback.


Zscaler took a brief pause around our SwingTrader exit and then started moving strong again **(6)**. Switching to position trading didn't require much more time to increase profits. By the end of the week, it was already well on its way to the 20% profit goal. Now even the position trader might be faced with a decision soon. Achieving 20% in that short of time might warrant holding for an even bigger gain.

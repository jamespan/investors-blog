It's hard to argue against the conventional stock market wisdom of "buy low, sell high." But Roku stock shows why the lesser known adage "buy high, sell higher" deserves some attention.




Swing Trading Example: Roku Stock
---------------------------------


**Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) already demonstrated its ability to make a move having already claimed a huge run since its initial public offering at the end of 2017. Most recently, a pullback to its 50-day moving average line started in mid-July **(1)**.


The [earnings report from second-quarter results](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-earnings-q2-2019-roku-stock/) for Roku caused a strong move from the 50-day line and a gap up **(2)** above the prior area of resistance. We added Roku stock to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) in early trading even though the stock was already up 20% from the previous day's close. Such moves carry the risk of a pullback, so you need to be vigilant and have an appropriate stop loss. We used the low on the day of our entry but realized it was tight given the move. As it touched the low, it immediately got support and so we tried to hold through some initial volatility and eventually closed with a gain for the day. [Upgrades and price-target hikes](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-stock-soars-to-record-high-on-big-second-quarter-beat/) added fuel to push the stock higher and give the sense that investors were changing their valuation of the company.


A Set-Top Box To Rule Them All
------------------------------


One of the compelling features of Roku is that with more entries into the streaming service game, they benefit as a one-stop shop for access. Their set-top boxes and streaming sticks provide a platform to easily switch between **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), Hulu and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) Prime Video. Their move to integration in TVs makes it even easier for users.


With new streaming services coming from **Walt Disney's** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) Disney+ and others, they stand to win even more. They can make revenue not just on subscriptions and services bought through their system but also on advertising-supported video. It's the move away from the hardware-only revenue model that has investors excited.


We hit our 5% profit goal the day after our entry and took half profits **(3)**. Taking some profits on the way up locks in gains while allowing some participation if the stock continues to move. We also [raised our stop loss to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry to retain the profits in our remaining position. Barring a gap down, the raised stop gets you out with a profit.


Price-Target Hike Keeps Momentum Going
--------------------------------------


The strength continued after the weekend. Needham analyst Laura Martin [reiterated a buy rating for Roku stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/roku-stock-spikes-street-high-price-target-hike/) stating her preference for Roku over Netflix stock. She upped her price target from 120 to 150. Roku stock tacked on another 7% that day and crossed our 10% profit goal **(4)**.


Rather than taking the remaining position off, we decided to give Roku stock more room to run. It continued closing at its highs each day with volume showing large demand for shares.


But we also approached the position with a level of caution. Its move put it well above its 50-day moving average line and that can make a stock ripe for a pullback. You want to balance getting more profit with retaining the profit you already have. We certainly wouldn't want to see the stock go all the way down to our 1% profit level so we watched it closely.


Bearish Reversal Gives Sell Signal
----------------------------------


Roku stock topped out at 142.10 the next day after a gap up in the morning **(5)**. That's more than 16% from our entry in less than a week. Then it had a character change. All good things must come to an end and a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) often signals when that happens in a stock.


The push to new highs drifted lower and by the close at 135.33, Roku stock was 4.8% off its high closing in the lower part of its trading range. We acted early when we saw the shift in momentum and removed the stock at 137.82. We don't expect to get out at the top tick but the exit gave us more profit than our original goal. From there Roku stock drifted lower as recession fears hit the stock market as a whole. It's still holding gains nicely from its earnings breakaway gap, despite dropping nearly 10% from its highs. For a longer-term perspective, that's strong action that could justify holding. But for swing trading, the quick 10% profit in under a week is more than sufficient.

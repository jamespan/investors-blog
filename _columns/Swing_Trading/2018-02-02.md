Taking a loss is an inevitable part of investing in stocks but not particularly enjoyable. After all, you don't enter a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) with the goal of losing money. It's easy to hesitate when it comes to selling. What if the stock comes right back after I sell? What if I just need to be patient? All sorts of questions can cause doubt and hesitation.


But if you can train yourself to shrug off the discomfort, you will come out further ahead over time. Taking losses when they are small is a key factor of being a successful swing trader. It makes room for new stocks that could provide your portfolio new growth or protects your portfolio from small losses turning into big losses.


Take **Halliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)). The stock joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on Jan. 22, [breaking out](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of a short handle from a yearlong [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) **(1)**. Halliburton had many things going for it. It had just [reported earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/halliburton-earnings-revenue-growth-beat-views-as-stock-nears-buy-point/) that beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom line; oil industry groups were showing strength and the oil minister of Saudi Arabia was expressing interest in continuing a deal with Russia to reduce exports; and finally, the market continued its strong move and rallied as the government shutdown ended. We also had extra confidence in the sector coming off a [successful trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/aligning-the-stars-to-increase-profits-in-stock-swing-trades/) in **Diamondback Energy** ([FANG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FANG)) that was good for 7.8% in 13 days.


Despite the marks in its favor, Halliburton did not remain as a current trade for long. The price action gave an early warning signal on Jan. 23 after its gain of 2.6% withered to under 1% by the close **(2)**. Large-cap group mates **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) and **McDermott** ([MDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDR)) also struggled on the day suggesting group weakness.


Price action worsened over the next two days turning what was a 4% profit from our entry into a flat trade. Haliburton closed near its lows for the day for three days in a row and closed a hair below its 5-day moving average line. By Jan. 26, the market started to show weak action and Halliburton exited SwingTrader **(3)**. With a half-hour left in the trading session, Halliburton was nearly 1% below its 5-day moving average line. We make our decisions around that time to give subscribers a chance to act before the close and in this case, we missed a quarter-percent rally that followed. That didn't amount to much as the stock dropped a few percentage points over the next couple of days **(4)**.


The trade showed a loss just under 0.2%. Hesitation would have only made the problem worse as the stock dropped over 5% the following week. As it stood, January's losing trades lost only 1% on average. Meanwhile, the gains averaged 5.5% for the month. And there were three times more winners than losers. Rather than bemoaning the losses, think of yourself as getting protection from further losses and one step closer to getting that next gain.

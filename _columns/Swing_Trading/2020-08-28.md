A [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) attempt in **Thermo Fisher Scientific** ([TMO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TMO)) didn't pan out and ended with a flat trade. [Taking profits early](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sq-stock-taking-early-profits-made-holding-easier/) and [cutting losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategies-cutting-losses/) kept the trade basically flat. As a result, we avoided a big gap down in TMO stock that could have made for a much different trade.




Swing Trading Example: TMO Stock
--------------------------------


With Thermo Fisher stock, an early entry did present itself on an [upside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/may-reversals-gave-multiple-swing-trading-chances/) **(1)** right around 400. It followed up strongly the next day on Aug. 12, which offered another entry **(2)**. On [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), we were positioning ourselves carefully at the time and passed on TMO stock.


The market at the time was a big reason. The Nasdaq composite had its first three consecutive losses since the April 6 follow-through day. The S&P 500, meanwhile, showed more strength at the time, suggesting potential rotation.

After flattening out a few days, Thermo Fisher joined SwingTrader as it moved about its short flat area **(3)**. It was even more attractive due to market uncertainty. As a less volatile stock, it held less risk. But we still gained exposure should the market continue higher.


Taking Profits, Cutting Losses
------------------------------


Often when dealing with less volatile stocks, we tend to take our profits a little earlier. With TMO stock, we took one-third profit at 2% a couple of days after our entry **(4)**. When swing trading we look to take profits early, knowing that we may leave some money on the table. Our goal is to capture strong moves early. If they continue higher, taking some early profits allows us to give a stock more room without risking a loss on the trade.


The next day, Thermo Fisher showed a big downside reversal on an outside day **(5)**. It quickly put the stock down below our initial entry and we exited the position. You expect weakness after that type of action and you never know how bad it can get or how long it will last. For swing trading, it's best to just step aside.


Even though our final exit was below our entry price, the earlier profit taking made a big difference. Rather than taking a loss on the trade, we ended slightly positive.


Expectation Delayed?
--------------------


Our expectation for weakness didn't come to fruition immediately. The next two days saw gains **(6)**. However, the gains barely recovered half the ground lost in the downside reversal. Not exactly a ringing endorsement.


Thursday saw a massive shakeout in TMO stock **(7)**. The 5% morning plunge easily could have turned this trade into an outsized loss. While the expectation for weakness didn't come immediately, it came eventually. Our early profit taking and quick loss cutting avoided it completely.

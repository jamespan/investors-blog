Every trader knows that over time you'll have plenty of losing stocks. The key to keeping a [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) portfolio healthy is to minimize stock losses. Sometimes that means selling stocks for no other reason than a lack of movement — especially when a stock doesn't participate in market gains.




It's an insidious aspect of sector rotation. You might find yourself in a decent market without members of your portfolio participating. Sector rotation is often the culprit and might require selling stocks to put money into more favorable areas. The late August rally had tech stocks acting as a driving force behind it. Small-cap stocks started strong but then took a back seat. Heavily weighted names like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) stock did a lot of the lifting. Certain sectors contributed — but often with fractured participation as earnings season created stark contrasts between similar stocks.


Take the retail sector. **American Eagle Outfitters** ([AEO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AEO)) stock, **Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) stock and **Macy's** ([M](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=M)) stock saw sharp declines. Meanwhile, **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) stock, **Tilly's** ([TLLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLLY)) stock, and **DSW** ([DSW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DSW)) stock rose. In between, a number of retail stocks started strong but just stopped participating in the market gains, such as **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)).


A breakout in Nike stock on Aug. 20 looked good at the start **(1)**. [Volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) confirmed the strength of the breakout as did a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) at new highs **(1)**. It joined [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day. Nike seemed well on its way to our first 5% price target but then showed a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(2)**. The stock pushed into new all-time highs but closed at the bottom of its range. The action wasn't that alarming by itself. But when the general market indexes pushed into new highs over the next few days, it did raise a level of concern.


For short-term swing trades, it makes sense that [short-term moving averages](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) are the most appropriate for determining a change in trend. Using them as a guide provides an [easy moving-average rule](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-moving-averages-can-help-cut-stock-losses-quicker/) to follow for selling stocks. Nike stock closed below its five-day moving average line **(3)** on Aug. 24 as the Nasdaq composite broke out to new high ground. It wasn't a decisive close below the line, however. Nike continued to hug the five-day moving average line the next few days. It often started with strength early in the day but faded by the close while the Nasdaq continued to pile on gains.


Selling Stocks That Don't Participate
-------------------------------------


Some volume came in as Nike stock retook its five-day moving average **(4)**. But the next day, we removed Nike from SwingTrader early in the session **(5)**. After holding it for two weeks, there was nothing to show for the swing trade. It turned negative and it looked like it would be a decisive close below both the five- and 10-day moving averages. The market indexes, after running up a number of consecutive days, faced potential pressure from renewed trade-war saber-rattling.


A stock that doesn't participate in the market strength has little chance of remaining in a portfolio in a market pullback. While sector rotation could lead to a renewed surge, more often these stocks take the harder hits. Selling stocks that don't have gains should be the first names jettisoned by investors when defensive action is necessary. Nike ended up as just a half-percent loss, but it could have been worse. Two days later and Nike stock triggered its stop loss. Not taking action would see the half-percent loss quickly turn into a 3% loss. Early action provides important protection.

  Sometimes Less Is More In Trading Activity

As the stock market started showing signs of improvement the last couple weeks, more [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) setups presented themselves. That's in sharp contrast to the low activity of August.


While fewer trades can seem boring, the strategy is sound if it's being used to protect capital. Rather than a sign of laziness, low activity can be a sign of prudence.


The action in August was especially a sharp contrast to a decent July. Of the 20 trading days in July, 14 had at least one active trade on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at some point in the day. For the 23 trading days in August, only eight had any active trades and usually it was only one stock at time. That was due to a heightened level of caution as a direct result of market weakness.


July started and ended the month with no active trades, but had opportunities in the middle. It started with **D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) on July 7 as an industry play on a market reversal **(1)**. The market action on SwingTrader shifted from sideways to uptrend the next day.


By July 13 **(2)**, a 4% profit was already booked in D.R. Horton and the active trades that day was up to four stocks, three of which were eventually closed for a profit. After 10 days up in a row, the number of active trades started to fall on July 21 **(3)** with some profit taking, and on July 27 the number came back down to zero as the market dropped**(4)**.


August became a month of tries and fails. The next three stocks that were added, one at a time, were all taken off with losses. The adds happened on Aug. 2 **(5)**, Aug. 16 **(6)** and Aug. 22 **(7).** The final add happened concurrently with the market action getting switched back to an uptrend. While having three losses in a row isn't desirable, the low activity coupled with an average loss below 3% still allowed for the protection of capital. With some of the stocks it was just a matter of the right stock at the wrong time.


Take **New Oriental Education** ([EDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EDU)) which was removed for a loss at the end of August. On Sept. 7, the stock vaulted nearly 10%, which would have led to a profitable trade. In retrospect, selling seems like it was a mistake. But holding a stock that's breaking down in an uncertain market is a risk that can have devastating consequences for your portfolio. When New Oriental Education was removed, the market was flattening out and it wasn't until Aug. 30 it started following through on its [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) **(8)** and stocks started getting added more than one at a time.


Though few stocks were added in August, it doesn't mean the search wasn't happening. A few stocks were added as [watch list](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/consider-watch-lists-homework-that-pays-off/) stocks but never became active. Either they never hit their buy zones, or when they did hit their buy zones, [volume was lacking](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sherlock-holmes-and-the-case-of-missing-volume/). While you could use the excuse that it was due to the summer, you have to question: What will fuel this move if it doesn't start with a strong buying interest? It was just one more factor that led to less action.

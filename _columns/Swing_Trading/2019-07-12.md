Stocks don't generally move in gradual steady lines, either up or down. There is more of a tendency to jump, consolidate, then move again. The goal in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) is to capture the bulk of the jump and sidestep the consolidation or sideways movement. That's what we did with a recent swing trade in Amarin stock.




Amarin Stock: Using A Stop Loss For Protection
----------------------------------------------


**Amarin** ([AMRN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMRN)) already has a big revenue generator thanks to Vascepa, a drug which lowers fatty triglycerides in the blood stream. A likely FDA approval would [expand Vascepa's use](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/amarin-stock-biotech-company-raises-guide-fda-mulls-high-triglycerides-treatment/) and boost that revenue even more. Amarin updated its guidance on July 2, spurring investors to calculate how much it increased the value of Amarin stock.


Amarin stock jumped at the open that day and was already up nearly 9% when we added it to [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) **(1)**.


It might seem like that's too late to initiate a position. But here's where a [proper stop loss and position size](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-calculator-swing-trading-tool/) can help mitigate risk. Of course, deciding on your [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/) is always a little bit of a balancing act. If you put the stop loss too tight, you increase the risk of being shaken out. Too loose, and you expose yourself to a larger loss.


In this case, putting the stop loss at the entry day low wouldn't give the stock much room. But the low of the prior day would expose us to too much risk. Our compromise was to set the stop loss at 19.99. If it undercut that point, it would fall back into its consolidation. That's a signal of a failed breakout or at least one that requires more time.


When You're Right, The Risk Gets Easier
---------------------------------------


The rising 5-day line would also serve as a safety net. Using a decisive close below the line would naturally raise the stop loss as time passed. If Amarin stock met our expectation and hit the profit goal, a raised stop would essentially eliminate our risk of losing capital unless a gap down occurred.


In this case Amarin stock hit the 5% profit goal in just a few hours. It might seem counterintuitive, but often the strongest stocks at the beginning of the trading session are the ones that push even higher. We took half profits at 5% and raised the stop to a 1% profit goal from our entry on SwingTrader. That means, barring a gap down in price, we would at least walk away with around a 3% average profit on the trade. The remaining half position still has a chance to increase the profit even more.


Taking Gains On Remaining Shares
--------------------------------


The next day, we hit our 10% profit goal on Amarin stock and we took profits on the remaining shares **(2)**. That put our average profit on the trade at 7.5% in just two days' time. We also noted in a custom alert to subscribers that this could be one to turn into a position trade.


Swing trading Amarin stock potentially improved your position in either case. If you took the gains, you have the opportunity to get back into the stock if it crosses back above a traditional buy point of 23.35. The 7.5% gains on the previous trade gives your portfolio a little extra cushion on your capital to get more aggressive with future positions.


If you kept a portion as a position trade, the swing trading entry gave you an early start on the move. You can potentially add shares back if the stock crosses the 23.35 entry, but you still have the low-cost shares you started with. Again, the extra profit cushion can help manage the position down the road.


But in the meantime, Amarin pulled back more than 10% **(3)**, showing once again how swing trading can capture meaningful profits quickly while avoiding the risk of sideways action.

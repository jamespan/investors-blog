There are many paths to successful investing in the stock market. But the best investors share at least one common trait: sound money management rules.


Rules are necessary to take emotions out of the equation when it comes to managing the constant struggle between reward and risk.


The stock market comes with risk no matter what strategy you employ. What allows people to sleep at night is the reduction of that risk whenever possible. That can be viewed in terms of the risk on a particular trade and the risk any particular trade can have on your portfolio.


IBD's latest product, [Swing Trader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), comes with a tool to help you with these calculations, the Position Size Calculator.


Input 1: Dollar Risk
--------------------


The first input to decide on will be the dollar risk you want for the trade. In other words, how much are you willing to lose on any one trade if you end up selling at your maximum stop loss? An average may be no more than a 1% hit to your portfolio. For a $100,000 portfolio, multiply by 0.01 and your maximum dollar risk is $1,000.

This may be adjusted given market conditions, your recent batting average or a stock's volatility. You might cut that dollar risk in half if the market is turning choppy and trendless;  you may increase it to $1,500 if you decide the market action and your profits will allow you to be more aggressive.


Input 2: Entry Price
--------------------


This will simply be the current price of the stock, or, if you are setting up a trade with a trigger that has yet to occur, your estimate of the price when the trade is placed. This will go into calculating the number of shares as well as your stop loss percentage.


Input 3: Stop Loss
------------------


The calculator will accept either the stop-loss percentage or the stop-loss value and use either input to automatically calculate the other. In most cases, you will enter a value: the low of either the reversal day or breakout day. Since the entry price is already entered, the stop-loss percentage can be calculated.


In other cases, you might want to just set a maximum percentage loss for the trade, say 3%. In that situation, it will return the stop-loss value based on the entry price entered.


The Calculation
---------------


With those three inputs, the position size calculator will return two values: the position size (by dividing the dollar risk by the stop-loss percentage) and number of shares (by dividing the position size by the entry price). When entering a trade with a tighter stop, a larger position size is possible at the same level of risk to your portfolio. On the other hand, a larger stop loss would return a reduced position size to compensate for the extra risk.


However, keep in mind that while you might have a tight stop loss, things outside of your control could affect the actual price you exit the trade, such as gaps down, slippage or volatile trading. As a result, be wary of a tighter stop leading to a position size that is too far outside your comfort zone. After all, you still need to sleep at night.

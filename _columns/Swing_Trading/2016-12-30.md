Buy low and sell high is the mantra of the investor. Of course the fear is that even if you sell high for a profit, what if the stock goes higher without you? It might be hard to hear, but that's just something to get used to, especially in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/).


A little salve for the wound is to remember the ultimate goals: quick profits in a small time frame with reduced risk. Applying that strategy consistently may miss some potential big winners, but over time can still lead to big compounded gains with your small winners.


Take **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)), one of the best performing stocks of the year. It was one of the first trades on [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) while the product was in its beta phase in March **(1)**. An 11% profit was booked after 18 days **(2)** as the market's tailwinds blew to the stock's favor. If you had held on an extra month you would have been at the same level **(3)**, so the sell avoided a month of dead money. Avoiding that period of dead money is the reasoning in favor of the swing trade.


But watching the stock triple over the next nine months is the kind of action that makes traders want to switch to buy and hold. Especially, when Nvidia was well contained by its 10-week line. However, it should be recognized that for any market there will always be the outliers. Changing strategies for the minority ignores the reality imposed on you by the majority. Nvidia and a handful of others were certainly the exception in 2016 where most growth stocks saw modest gains before consolidating, or worse, rolling over. There weren't nearly as many large winners as you would see in a sustained rally.


Over the next few months, the gains piled up in Nvidia, often instigated by earnings announcements. The May earnings report was followed by a 15% gain the next day and the November earnings announcement was followed by a 30% gain. Taking a position before those moves would have been difficult, given the volatility that follows earnings.


Another opportunity for a swing trade presented itself recently, and Nvidia was back on SwingTrader on Dec. 14 as it moved from a short consolidation **(4)**. In a week's time, the stock rose more than 10% and was removed to book profits **(5)**. Taking half profits on the way up led to an overall gain of 8.3% for SwingTrader. Nvidia went up another two days, strongly, which made the chart look climactic **(6)**. No matter what strategy you use, selling on the way up in climactic action is a good practice. The subsequent drop can make your exit a lot more painful if it's just a little late.


It should be noted, in a different market with a stronger trend, a swing trade can adapt to capture a larger chunk of the outsize  gains. But when the rallies are shorter, the majority of your trades should follow.

Losses are inevitable. Keeping them small is critical. It's especially important when your profit target is lower as it is with [swing trading strategies](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). Protection from losses starts with the exit plan you set at the beginning of each trade, the stop loss. But sometimes it makes sense to part ways early when a stock doesn't meet your expectations.




Swing Trading Strategies Example: FleetCor Stock
------------------------------------------------


Take **FleetCor Technologies** ([FLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FLT)). The payment solutions stock came out of a short consolidation in November **(1)** and we added it to [SwingTrader.](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) wasn't above its peak from October, but it did make it into recent new high territory **(2)**. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) wasn't more than 50% above average, but it was the highest in nearly a month **(3)**.


Among the more important swing trading strategies is setting your [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-china-trade-war-baozun-stock/). In this case, the entry day low was a little tight at just 2%. A tight stop loss offers protection but increases the likelihood you'll get shaken out. We gave FleetCor stock a little more room and used the low of the day prior to the entry day. That would give the stock more room and the chance to get support around 300.

By the end of the day, we were up on the position. On Dec. 2, the market suffered a heavy day of distribution. FleetCor stock started out incredibly strong, but didn't finish that way **(4)**. Downside reversals can be warning signs of weakness to come, but given its strength relative to the market we gave it more time.


The Slow Decline
----------------


After a phase-one deal in the [China trade war](https://www.investors.com/news/china-u-s-trade-communist-tweets/) looked like it might get delayed, the market sold off sharply the morning of Dec. 3. FleetCor fell as well but recovered swiftly, finding support at its 10-day moving average line **(5)**. Because of its recovery, we gave it more room even though it closed below the 5-day moving average. The area around 300 also seemed to provide an area of support for FleetCor stock **(6)**.


At a certain point, the decline in the stock, while mild, was troublesome. It just wasn't participating in the market move. After rallying for a couple of days, the stock fell again and we exited the position **(7)**. The relative strength line was falling with the lack of participation and we kept our loss small at just 1.6%. We had added a number of winning stocks like **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) to SwingTrader the day before. It's a good swing trading strategy to make room in your portfolio for better performers by cutting the weak ones.


The focus on strength has a healthy byproduct. It often keeps a loss from growing. Just one day later, FleetCor plunged through its 50-day moving average line **(8)**. It only got worse from there, eventually triggering our stop loss and falling further. We avoided the whole mess with our early exit.

With our usual focus on growth, it might be odd to think of an old Dow Jones Industrials stock for [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). But as there is more than one way to skin a cat, there are many ways to make money in the stock market. Which brings us to CAT stock.




Swing Trading Example: CAT Stock
--------------------------------


**Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) hasn't seen annual earnings growth in years. So how did it end up getting so much coverage in IBD and eventually land on [SwingTrader](https://get.investors.com/swingtrader/?intcode=start%7Cstart%7Cprdmcst%7C2021%7Cna%7Cst%7Cna%7C%7C397709&src=A011LPH)? In the studies of best performing stocks of each market cycle spearheaded by [IBD Founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/william-oneil-legendary-investor-ibd-founder-canslim-creator/), many of the winners were cyclicals and turnarounds. CAT stock has an unimpressive relative strength line long term. But just look at the stock's move in 2016 and 2017 and you can see there are opportunities for swing trading. The key to remember is that the stock price will often move before the earnings for the cyclical stocks.



Most recently, CAT stock joined SwingTrader on Feb. 2 after getting support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-a-key-reference-for-investors/) and crossing above its [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) **(1)**. If that sounds familiar, it was [similar action to last week's column on Novocure stock](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-before-nvcr-stock-earnings-captured-quick-gain/).


Once in the stock, we used similar rules. We took a third off into strength after getting over a 3% profit in under a week **(2)**. We took another third as we approached 200 and had over a 5% profit **(3)**. Our strategy from there was simple. If CAT stock got above 200 we'd let it run. If it reversed we would book our profits.

On Feb. 16, CAT stock popped above 200 and this also coincided with the peak in the Nasdaq composite **(4)**. It was featured as the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/cat-stock-breaks-out-global-economic-outlook-dow-jones-caterpillar/), detailing all the positives in the stock., A couple days later it pulled back but got support around 200 and its [5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-average-lines-swing-trading-stock-profits/) **(5)**.


Divergence In Indexes
---------------------


CAT stock recovered with a big upside move **(6)** and started running over 10% in just a few days. By contrast, the Nasdaq composite was struggling. Our exposure was on the lighter side due to the Nasdaq's action but we were still having success in some of our rotation plays.


On Feb. 24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved to new high ground while the Nasdaq composite was trying to find support at its 50-day line. This was the peak for the Dow Jones and in CAT stock **(7)**.


Two days later, Caterpillar had a decisive close below its 5-day moving average line **(8)** but the Dow Jones Industrial Average was showing potential support at its 50-day line. We gave CAT stock some more room since we still had cushion and our overall exposure was already below 30% invested.


We exited on March 4 after it looked like CAT stock was losing support from its 10-day moving average line **(9)**. While the 21-day moving average offered support, the market action kept suggesting harder trading ahead. However, that support held as the market rallied Friday and CAT stock returned to SwingTrader.

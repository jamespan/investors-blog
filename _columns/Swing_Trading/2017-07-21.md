When you receive a generous gift, it's usually in poor taste to ask for more. However, investors do it all the time.


**D.R. Horton** ([DHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DHI)) provided [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) with a nice gift after it was added on July 7 **(1)**. It was part of a bullish move among homebuilders while the market was trying to find its footing after the Nasdaq composite breached its 50-day moving average for just the second time this year.




The day after being added amid a 3.8% gain, D.R. Horton had its price target raised by Argus Research lifting the stock to a 4.6% profit at its peak for the day **(2).** Profits were taken on the entire position at 4% rather than holding out for a 5% or even 10% profit goal. You might wonder, why sell so early? What about letting winners run and trying to get more out of the stock? Whatever happened to greed is good?


Looking back on the history of D.R. Horton, a 7% move in the span of two days was unusually strong behavior, especially without an earnings report acting as a catalyst. We tend to take notice when a stock changes character. Also, while the market was improving — the Nasdaq just got back above its 50-day moving average line — there hadn't been much of a correction. That left the risk of the market taking another leg down. Booking a solid 4% profit seemed prudent rather than getting greedy and asking for more.


That sell ended up being near a short-term top. After dropping slightly, the stock hit the 4% profit level again but then reversed more sharply **(3).** If it hadn't been sold earlier, this would have been the time to step out. After that, D.R. Horton remained positive from the entry on SwingTrader as it began hugging its 5-day moving average line. The closes didn't stray far from the line, but some of the intraday action would have been challenging and it eventually closed below the 10-day moving average line **(4)**.


It would be easy to justify holding the stock through all this. You never turned negative on the trade and it seemed that getting to the previous level or beyond wasn't far-fetched. However, that also meant that after nearly two weeks you were worse off than locking in the gain early. While there are plenty of examples where that kind of start can turn into a huge winner, having a sense of what the market will give you and the stock's normal behavior will help you get the most pleasure out of your gifts.

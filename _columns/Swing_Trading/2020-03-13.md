One benefit of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) is that the short-term focus can help your long-term profits. An early entry on a reversal could help you hold a leader for a bigger gain. And just as important, locking in profits and cutting losses quickly can help preserve your capital in a bear market.




Getting Out Before The Stock Market Correction
----------------------------------------------


In our [swing trading column from Feb. 24](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-fears-spark-another-weekend-retreat/), we outlined our reasons for raising cash on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) just one day off the market peak on Feb. 20. It wasn't just one factor. The stock market had an [expectation breaker](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-expectation-breakers-what-to-do-when-stock-market-throws-you-curveball/) when its move to new highs undercut an area of consolidation. We [locked in profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-profits-early-is-a-key-tenet-of-swing-trades/) on a lot of stocks on the way up and we couldn't find many setups to serve as replacements. The end result was being in nearly all cash well before a bear market took hold.


At that point we had a win rate of 69% for the year. Our average gain in our winners was 3.7% vs. 1.5% for the average loss. We built up gains and we wanted to protect them. It was unclear how much of a stock market correction we should anticipate. While the [coronavirus fears](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-news-covid-19-infects-stock-market-economy-business-face-test/) were driving the stock market lower, signs of a slowdown in China led to quick support at the end of January. Could headlines save the market again?


Staying Out Of The Bear Market
------------------------------


As the global picture for the spread of Covid-19 worsened, fear gripped investors. The stock market reflected that psychology with its sharp drop to bear market territory. But, as is typical during sharp drops, we also saw rebound attempts. Keeping flexible, we looked at each rally attempt with cautious optimism.

By using [test trades with half positions](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/why-half-position-dominos-stock-made-swing-trading-sense/), we could start ramping up exposure and only increase it if we saw progress. In each case, we kept our stop losses tight, balancing the risk that we would get shaken out with the desire to preserve capital. The stock market gave us the [feedback we needed with a low batting average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/). Of the trades attempted since Feb. 25, only 15% closed with a profit. Considering a 12.5% weight as a full position (somewhat conservative by swing trading standards), we never got more than a third invested on the rally attempts. Our lack of success kept us from increasing exposure.


As the bear market continued, the half-position test trades resulted in just a 2.2% hit from our peak gain on Feb. 19. By contrast the S&P 500 saw a 26.7% decline.


Where Do We Go From Here?
-------------------------


There's been little temptation to get involved in this bear market. We only did one half-position attempt this week and backed away with little damage. Our gap above the S&P 500 is wider than ever, so how do we keep it?


First, we know that opportunity accompanies every bear market. The stock market will eventually rebound, at least for a short while. Upside reversals might be the way to go at first. We'll look for those stocks that fought against the bear market. It will show up in their [relative strength lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/). We'll also look for those reversals in the stock market as a whole. A [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) would give us more confidence of a rally's potential, but we still approach with caution. We know that follow-through days can fail, and it's the combination of the market, our win rate and progress in individual stocks that help inform our decisions to increase exposure.


As time goes on, we'll see more bases form and eventually [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/). With swing trading, we can focus on shorter bases than the typical five-week minimum of the [flat base](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-3/). This could give us early entries coming out of the bear market. Acting quickly if a rally takes hold will also help us keep our gap above the S&P 500. Ideally, it will turn a great start to the year into an even more profitable one.

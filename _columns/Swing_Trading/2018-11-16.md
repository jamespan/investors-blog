When determining position size for a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), a few factors come into play. The market environment and the risk on the individual swing trade are particularly important. Above all, with every swing trade you need to identify the risks and make sure that one trade doesn't devastate your portfolio.




As a starting point for position size, determine how much of your portfolio you are willing to risk in a swing trade. More than 1% is aggressive. In a shaky market, you may want to reduce your portfolio risk to a half of 1% or less. You should also reduce the number of swing trades you attempt.


Adjusting Position Size To Reduce Risk
--------------------------------------


**Staar Surgical** ([STAA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STAA)) provides an example of how to determine and adjust position size. The setup began as the stock rose to its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) but hit [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) **(1)**. For four straight days it butted its head against the line only to ease off by the close.


On Nov. 7, Staar Surgical stock broke above the 50-day moving average line and was up around 7% in the first 30 minutes of the regular trading session **(2)**. Its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) led the price into high ground **(2)** and the stock joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 47.27 as it made a new intraday high. But we adjusted it to a half position, rather than the usual full position.


In this case, it was a larger than normal risk percentage for the individual swing trade. With such a strong start, putting the [stop loss at the low of the entry day](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) exposed us to a 7% risk. Rather than skip the trade entirely, the half position would reduce the hit to our portfolio if it triggered.


A [sound position size](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sound-position-sizing-opens-door-to-powerful-stock-moves/) opens the door to even greater swing trade moves. As for the market, the entry in Staar Surgical stock coincided with a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) in the market. We never know if the follow-through day is going to work but we always try to buy something so we participate if the rally holds. That is, as long as we find proper setups. There's no reason to try and force the issue.

Our swing trade continued to move up throughout the day and by midday it hit our first profit goal of 5%. We sent an alert out to subscribers noting that it was an area to take profits but we were holding. We did still [raise our stop loss to 1% profit from our entry](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-price-target-when-to-sell-stocks/).


The raised stop seemed to be too tight in this case. The next day, Staar Surgical stock shook us out but then reversed and closed nearly flat **(3)**. We still left the trade with a gain but the volatility proved difficult to handle.


We wanted to reduce our risk as quickly as possible and that often means sacrificing return. This is also a case where the combination of taking half profits and raising the stop loss would reduce the risk while preserving gains.


The raised stop loss ended up saving us from further losses. When Staar Surgical closed decisively below its [five-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/), it also undercut the entry day's low **(4)**. The half position to start helped manage the risk early and our rules helped keep the swing trade profitable.

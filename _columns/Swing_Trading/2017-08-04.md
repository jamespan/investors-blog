It's a delicate balance deciding how much room to give a profitable [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). Give it too much and you can easily find that your profits disappear. Not enough room and you get shaken out and the stock moves up without you.




Either situation affects your psychology and may cause an overreaction in subsequent trades. That's why you need rules to keep you grounded and steady, rather than being subject to the pendulum swings of emotion.


For example, taking half profits eases some psychological angst. [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) often takes half profits when a stock is up 5% from its entry. It's easier to give a stock more room when you've taken some money off the table. If the stock continues up, you improve your average exit price. If it turns on you, booking partial profits gives you a better chance of walking away with a profitable trade overall.


Another helpful rule is moving up your stop as you make progress. Once we gain 5% from our entry, we raise our stop to 1% profit. Combined with half profits at 5%, we'll at least walk away with a 3% profit on the trade, barring any major gaps down. Using a [short-term moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-averages-can-help-lock-in-stock-profits/) such  as the 5- or 10-day line also allows you to book profits before they escape. We generally look for a decisive close beneath the moving average line to avoid getting shaken out by a temporary test beneath the line.


**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) was a recent winner on SwingTrader that used these rules beneficially. It was added on July 11 at 25.07 as it broke out of a consolidation in heavy volume **(1)**. The next day it quickly hit the 5% goal and half profits were taken **(2)**. The stop was raised to 1% from our entry to help preserve profit on the remaining shares as we set our sights on 10%.


Over the next seven trading days, Square was up over 8% at its peak as it inched along its 5-day moving average line. The remaining shares were removed July 24 as the stock fell back to the 5% profit level after undercutting its 5- and 10-day moving average lines **(3)**. At this point, its earnings report was due in just over a week, and letting the stock drop too much would risk running out of time for a recovery.


To be sure, it was frustrating to see the stock recover by the end of the day and hit the 10% profit goal two days later **(4)**. It would have ended the trade with a 7.5% gain rather than 5%, but that also came with increased risks. Getting greedy and holding out for more profit wouldn't have gone well as Square suffered a dramatic drop **(5)** along with the market on July 27. A week later and the stock was back at its entry price **(6)**. Rules avoided some significant heartache.

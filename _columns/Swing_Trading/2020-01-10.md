If a stock doubles in price you might assume you missed it. Not so with Crocs stock. And a looser [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) profit goal was worth an even bigger gain.


Swing Trading Example: Crocs Stock
----------------------------------


The last quarter of 2019 was highly profitable as indexes broke above a trading pattern going back to 2018. By November, **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) was up 100% from its June lows. Sometimes it's these strongest stocks that offer further gains.


The maker of comfortable footwear consolidated its gains for a few weeks then cleared [resistance](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/villains-say-resistance-is-futile-swing-traders-disagree/) around 37 on Dec. 16 **(1).** That earned it a place on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 37.30. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) wasn't at all-time highs but was at near-term highs along with the price **(2)**. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/trading-volume-swing-trading-ross-stores-stock/) was below average **(3)**, but the highest in nearly two weeks. [We set our stop](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-china-trade-war-baozun-stock/) on Crocs stock at the low of the entry day. A break below this level would be an early signal that the trade wasn't working.

How Long Do You Let Your Profits Run?
-------------------------------------


In just a couple of days, we reached [our 5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) **(4)**. We took half profits and [raised our stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry on SwingTrader. After hovering around the 5-day moving average line a few days, Crocs stock made another move. We hit our 10% profit goal just above 41 **(5).** Rather than taking the remaining profit, we sent an alert that we would let it go a bit longer.


On Jan. 7 we nearly reached 15% from our initial entry **(6)**. Crocs stock wasn't doing anything wrong. On the contrary, moving that much in just three weeks was more than satisfactory and it held its [5-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) the whole way. But with the [stock market extended](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/take-profits-swing-trades-extended-market-westlake-chemical-stock/), we didn't want to overstay our welcome. Sealing the decision to remove shares, Crocs stock staged a bearish reversal and looked like it would close below its 5-day moving average for the first time since we added it.


The next day, the stock snapped right back to its highs **(7)**. In hindsight, our profits could have been larger. But looking at similar action in stocks after bearish reversals we knew the odds and they weren't in our favor. On that day, it wasn't a desirable outcome but the decision was still sound.

[Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) doesn't have to be limited to stocks. Exchange traded funds (ETFs) also provide opportunities as we recently saw in the financial sector. Using a triple-leveraged ETF like Direxion Financial Bull 3X ([FAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAS)) can give you the diversification across different stocks. But the leverage gives you more of the performance potential of an individual stock.




Swing Trading Example: Direxion Financial ETF
---------------------------------------------


We started FAS out as a watchlist stock on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) after it formed a cup-with-handle **(1)**. The high of the handle was at 74 so a breakout above that level could act as our signal for an entry. However, when the breakout came the next day at the stock market open **(2)**, we didn't trigger FAS as a buy idea immediately. The open was strong but the ETF pulled back shortly after. In our swing trading alert to subscribers, we wrote to wait for a confirmation of strength before acting.


The financial sector ETF ended up coming back near the end of the day, finally rising above its open. Rather than building on its early gains, the ETF took the whole day just to recover the gains it had in the first five minutes of trading. And that didn't happen until the final 15 minutes. For that reason, we left FAS untriggered.


That caution proved justified as the triple-leveraged ETF dropped back to its 50-day moving average line over the next week. As part of swing trading strategy, we want to avoid such movements sitting on "dead money." However, we left FAS on our watchlist as another potential catalyst loomed. [Bank stress tests were due soon](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/bank-stocks-pop-amid-jpmorgan-others-stock-buybacks-dividends-stress-tests-2019/). With reserves where they need to be, companies can effectively determine money available for distribution to shareholders. So, dividends or share-buyback announcements by companies often follow.


Those announcements fueled a nice bounce across the financial sector and FAS reaped the benefits **(3)**. While FAS fell after the open, by midday it was at its highs for the day. We triggered it on SwingTrader with a swing trading alert to subscribers at 73.86.


Keeping Profits While You Have Them
-----------------------------------


Three days later and we had a 5% gain from our entry **(4)**. As is our custom, we took half profits at that level and raised our stop. Locking in swing trading profits on the way up keeps your portfolio heading in the right direction and also helps avoid pullbacks in the market. When you've taken some money off the table and you can't find anything new to replace the position, usually there's a reason. A market pullback may be imminent.


The raised stop helps protect the profits that you have. We tend to favor a 1% profit level above our entry. That means, barring a gap down in price, you'll at least exit with a 3% profit on the trade.


The next 5% came slower for FAS. By July 15, the ETF was 3 cents shy of our 10% profit level and then reversed **(5)**. Rather than hold out for the 10% goal, we used the [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) as our cue to protect profit on the remaining shares. We preserved an 8.3% gain for that half of the trade. As the stock market also seemed extended, it seemed like the right action for the environment.


The stock market did indeed see a pullback and FAS followed along. A day after our removal a close below the 5-day moving average would have knocked us out with our swing trading rules. Or at the very least, the slice through the 10-day moving average the next day **(6)**. While FAS remained above our raised stop level, removing it on the reversal saved us from sitting through a 5.7% drawdown from our top. Keeping what you've earned is essential swing trading strategy.

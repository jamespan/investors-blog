Industry group strength is like an afterburner for a top-rated company. It supplies that extra boost for a stock that's already moving on great fundamentals and technicals.


Looking at shorter time frames for the group performance can give you an edge on emerging trends, and is especially useful in [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/).


IBD tracks performance for 197 industry groups. Each stock is placed in a group according to what part of its business provides the majority of its revenue. **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) for example, used to be in the computer manufacturing group and now, thanks to the iPhone, it belongs to the telecommunications consumer products group.


What do you do with the information? Knowing which groups are performing best gives you a good indication of where to look for prospects. IBD ranks each industry group by its six-month performance. [MarketSmith](https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/), a premium service offered by IBD, allows you to also sort groups by three-month performance to get an idea of power on a shorter time frame and provides all the components of each group as well.


Looking at the computer networking industry group, it was ranked No. 81 out of 197 industry groups 13 weeks ago and made it to the top 10 nearly two months ago. MarketSmith currently shows it as No. 9 in three-month performance with a group move of 15% in that time frame.


An industry rise like that means you may find a number of names extended, so you can't just buy anything. But going through 23 members of the group, **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) and **Juniper Networks** ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) were two names that jumped out as leaders last month and both were considered for IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). Both had high [Composite Ratings](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/), but Juniper had better volume characteristics ahead of its earnings report on April 25 after the close **(1)**.


The stock vaulted after earnings and was added the next day at 29.49 as it broke out on huge volume **(2)**. It wasn't added immediately at the open, but was watched closely in the first couple hours of the trading session to see if it would hold its gains.


Within four days, on May 2, the stock was already ahead 5%, so profits were taken on half the position **(3)** at 30.91. A consolidation started the next day as Juniper dropped below its 5-day moving average line **(4)**, prompting the removal of the remaining position at 30.36. The average exit price was 30.64 for a 3.9% gain in six days.


The consolidation stands at eight days now and could provide another opportunity in the stock as the group remains strong. Other groups showing three-month strength according to MarketSmith include: education, semiconductors, internet content and casino stocks. You also may want to pay attention when stocks from different groups show a similar theme. Many of the above groups sport leaders coming out of China, which is confirmed by the iShares MSCI China ETF ([MCHI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCHI)) reaching new highs.

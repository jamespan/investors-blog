In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, "The Silver Blaze," Sherlock Holmes observed the "curious incident" of the watchdog that didn't bark. In that famous case, the biggest clue was what was absent rather than what was present.


Astute traders should also take notice when a trade setup lacks volume (the amount of shares being traded) as it offers a clue that should make you suspicious. Sure, a stock can still go up without volume. It just means that in addition to low demand, there was even less selling pressure. But consider that with swing trading, you are looking for a profit goal in a relatively short time frame. If there isn't demand at a critical point like a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-stock-breakout-strategies-have-familiar-rules/) or [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/), what will drive the price up over the next five or 10 days?


That's why volume is a critical component of proper setups and why many names are passed over for [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) product. Are there stocks that have strong moves without volume? Absolutely. However, we strive to be disciplined and get as many elements working in our favor as possible.


Since volume can vary significantly across stocks and even within a stock's own trading history, it's important to keep comparisons relative. For example, summer generally sees lower volume so a breakout on low turnover might still pass muster. Compare the day to recent trading activity. If the volume surpasses all the days of the consolidation or pullback, that shows demand is strong relative to the recent selling or inaction. It might not be strong demand relative to the last 50-day's average volume, but if it is heavy relative to the last week or so, that is usually sufficient.


There are cases where you might ignore an outlier of heavy volume. You might have a breakout that looks strong and volume is higher than most of the consolidation, except one day. If the day was an options expiration or news related surge, sometimes it is useful to exclude it from your comparison.


**Patrick Industries** ([PATK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PATK)) was a stock with a mismatch in price and volume. After getting support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/), the stock attempted a breakout on Sept. 2 **(1)**. But volume in the first couple hours of trade was unimpressive and a sharp reversal off the intraday high was signaling the need for caution.


The stock eventually recovered and by the end of the day was at the highs made in the first hour. Volume picked up into the close but was still unimpressive compared with recent activity **(2)**.The stock ventured north briefly and within a few days was back below both its 5- and 10-day moving average **(3)**. The missing volume was certainly a contributing factor to the stock's demise. Mystery solved.

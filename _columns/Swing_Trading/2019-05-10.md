The first quarter of 2019 saw a stellar return after a dismal end to 2018. But with trade war fears exacerbated this past week, are the good times over for now? Here's what we're looking at to determine if this is just an ordinary pullback in an overall uptrend or a bear market on the way.




Bear Market Recovery
--------------------


Just to put the latest rally in perspective, the 23% bear market correction in the Nasdaq composite lasted for about 80 days from the August top to the December bottom. A little more than 80 days after the bottom, the Nasdaq composite was back at its all-time highs. The 31% move from the bottom earned the index a well-deserved break. Determining how long that break will last and how serious it might be requires daily analysis.


On the way up from the bear market, there was already a little bit of a stopping point at 8000, just 1.6% away from its all-time highs**(1)**. The index launched from there on April 23 in higher volume **(2)** suggesting the rally was ready to continue. A week later and we were back at all-time highs, though volume didn't accompany that particular day **(3)**. More troubling was the action of many leading stocks. On [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), we had a 60% [win rate](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/) for the year at the beginning of April and it dropped to 53% by the end of April. More [breakouts](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) and setups were failing.


That's why it came as no surprise when back-to-back [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) hit the market on May 1 **(4)**. As a result, we switched our market action on SwingTrader to sideways trend and exited our lone position at the time. The next day narrowly avoided distribution due to lower volume but found support at 8000, the previous area of resistance. Strong economic reports pushed the index to a new closing high on May 3, but again with lower volume **(5)**. Still, a new closing high isn't something we argue with so we switched back to uptrend noting the support as well. Supporting action calms bear market fears. However, we wanted a stronger showing in compelling setups in leading stocks and didn't find what we were looking for. We didn't put any new trades on but started building our watch list. Action would be taken on continued strength.


China Trade War Fears Spark Selling
-----------------------------------


That strength hasn't materialized yet. The following day saw a dramatic shift lower **(6)** after Trump threatened another round of tariffs against China (they went into effect Friday). Again, the index found support at 8000 and rallied by the end of the day, closing near the top of its trading range. Notably, the index lost that support at 8000 the next day while getting slapped with another day of distribution **(7)**. The China trade war fears found further fuel with comments from U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer.


With the 8000 level breached, the next area of support stands at the 50-day moving average line. Sometimes that can be a final stand before a bear market takes hold. Even with an extra day of distribution added on Thursday **(8),**that support level is holding so far. Now that the additional tariffs on China are out there, the question is how much does this escalate? What does China do in reaction? Are the seeds of a global recession already planted? You not only have to analyze the news events and their future ramifications but also the stock market reaction to the news.


Is a Bear Market On The Horizon?
--------------------------------


A pause in the selling here would suggest more of a normal pullback in an uptrend. Coming off the high by 3% to 4%, about where we are now, is normal behavior in that regard and far from the 20% correction that normally defines a bear market. Small pullbacks are even desirable because they can lead to a more sustainable rally and provide new opportunities. Stocks tend to bounce off moving average lines, form handles, or even new flat bases during mild pullbacks.


A more dramatic turn south would be a bigger concern for a bear market. A slice through the 50-day moving average makes it looks more like a "vertical violation." That's where support is lost quickly painfully and decisively. The aftermath usually requires more time and more pain before turning around again. Taking profits on the way up in SwingTrader left our exposure minimal as the pain worsened over the past two weeks. We may put some test trades on while the market continues to find its way but will strive to sidestep a stock market correction should it occur, just [as we did in the Q4 bear market](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-swing-trading/). Historical precedent will once again provide a guide in that regard.


With all the negative action, does that suggest a shift in thinking to shorting opportunities? With a news driven event like trade war fears, it's hard to find an advantage. It leaves an uncertain future that's more like a coin flip than a calculated risk offset with a better potential return.

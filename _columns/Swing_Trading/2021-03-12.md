[Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) should be approached with a certain amount of flexibility. You want to have rules to unemotionally guide your decisions. But it's also OK to make adjustments to your strategy along the way. Especially to take advantage of strength like we saw in VIPS stock.




Swing Trading Example: VIPS Stock
---------------------------------


**Vipshop Holdings** ([VIPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIPS)) is a Chinese internet retailer that had a huge move starting in 2012. After topping in 2015, it based for five years before getting back to its former highs.



VIPS stock made it onto [SwingTrader](https://get.investors.com/swingtrader/?intcode=start%7Cstart%7Cprdmcst%7C2021%7Cna%7Cst%7Cna%7C%7C397709&src=A011LPH) on Feb. 1 afterÂ getting support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-a-key-reference-for-investors/) and crossing above its [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) **(1)**. This might seem like a broken record. We covered this [in a column on Novocure stock](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-before-nvcr-stock-earnings-captured-quick-gain/) and [last week's column on CAT stock](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cat-stock-shows-theres-more-to-consider-than-just-growth-stocks/). Why the repeat? This is a successful swing trading pattern that repeats frequently in winning stocks. Looking at multiple examples will hopefully make it easier to recognize in the future. As is the case with these three swing trading examples, they all corresponded to the same date as the stock market pullback was a big influence in the setup.


Like our other examples, we were quickly rewarded. In the case of VIPS stock, it was just faster and bigger. We took a third off into strength the next day already up to 5% profit **(2)**. Then another third came off one day later with over a 10% gain from our entry **(3)**. And VIPS stock kept going.

We exited the trade a few days later after hitting a 20% gain from our entry in just over one week **(4)**. The stock market indexes, especially the Nasdaq composite, seemed to be quickly returning to extended territory. The earnings report for VIPS stock was still two weeks away. But sideways action could erode that time quickly without much gain and as a swing trading rule we don't hold through earnings.


Turning A Swing Trade To A Position Trade
-----------------------------------------


Another option, and one often mentioned in our alerts to subscribers, is turning a swing trade into a position trade. On Feb. 19, VIPS stock did breakout of its sideways movement **(5)** but earnings were less than a week away by that time. Here's where the early cushion from the swing trading could have really helped.


Initiating a position on Feb. 19 wouldn't give you much time to build a profit cushion before earnings. Plus, while the drop on Feb. 23 found support at the 21-day line **(6)**, it also could have shaken you out with the stock hitting the 7%-8% loss cutting rule.


The earlier swing trading entry afforded you a lot more cushion to hold through the pullback. As a position trade, a close below the 21-day line as an exit wouldn't give up much profit.


Also, by the time the earnings report came out **(7)**, the cushion and smaller position size (remember two-thirds was removed into strength) would make sitting through earnings easier. From there, even with the stock market going into a correction, it never showed up on the VIPS stock chart. It's held its 10-day moving average line **(8)**, making it fairly easy to hold.

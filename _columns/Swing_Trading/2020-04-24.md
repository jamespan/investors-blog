Let's face it, not all trades work. But sometimes a losing trade will set up again a week or two later. That's what recently happened [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) Netflix stock. Rather than a case of "once bitten, twice shy," it was more like "third time's a charm."




Coronavirus Stock Market Play: Netflix Stock
--------------------------------------------


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) had nearly a two-year hiatus from new highs. In mid-February, it was finally getting close again but the relative strength line didn't look great. That all changed with the coronavirus stock market crash.


While Netflix stock went down along with pretty much everything else, it didn't fall as much. Its 26% drop was far better than the 35% slide for the S&P 500. Netflix stock had an obvious benefit from stay-at-home orders. More time at home gave Netflix a captive audience.

Our first swing trading attempt with Netflix this year came as the stock cleared its 50-day line **(1)**. Two days later, we exited before our stop loss was hit. The stock turned negative on us and we wanted to keep the loss small. It was just a [test position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-position-test-trade-reduces-risk/).


After getting [support at the 50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-use-the-50-day-moving-average-to-pinpoint-opportunity-or-risk/), Netflix stock bounced strongly as the Nasdaq composite staged a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) **(2)**. The stock joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) again. However, before the three-day Easter weekend, we decided to shed stocks in which we were down. It was a modified "[weekend retreat](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-fears-spark-another-weekend-retreat/)" to reduce the risk of potential negative headlines over the holiday. Netflix stock was among the casualties.


The Trade That Lived
--------------------


You would think that after getting burned a couple times, we wouldn't go for a third. But when the setup is right, you don't want to let past losses get in the way of future success. After the long weekend, Netflix stock shot up and we gave it another try **(3)**. Was it at a higher price than our sell? Yes. But it still made sense and we didn't let that stop us from reestablishing our half position.


The next day, we were already at our 5% profit goal **(4)**. Rather than [take half profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/), the strength suggested we could get a bigger impact. We sent an alert to subscribers that we would hold for now. Still, [we raised the stop to 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) from our entry to at least leave with some profit. Then we hit the 10% profit goal **(5)**. At this point, we took half profits. Locking in some gains on the way up is good practice with swing trading.


The remaining position came off the following day **(6)**. [Selling into strength](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-into-strength-can-maximize-profit-in-swing-trades/) often gives you the bulk of the profit before a pullback. You can always buy it back as we've demonstrated multiple times. While Netflix stock blew through the resistance of its old high at 423, the 450 level seemed a logical stopping point. Also, earnings were coming and it's our practice to sell before earnings. Our final exit of 445.95 was 15.5% above our initial entry. That's solid for four days, and there's no need to get greedy.


Position Trade Vs. Swing Trade For Netflix Stock
------------------------------------------------


Netflix stock was also added on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), the same day as SwingTrader **(3)**. We held the position through earnings since there was a decent profit cushion beforehand. The move after earnings was mildly down the next day **(7)**, but looks like a normal pullback. With a position trade, that's an acceptable thing to sit through and part of getting the bigger gain out of a leader.

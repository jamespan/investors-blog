Recent weakness may cause rising fears of another stock market correction. We won't know for sure until after the fact, but here's what we know now and how it will help your [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/).




Recovery From 2018 Stock Market Correction
------------------------------------------


We've had an incredibly strong recovery from the [2018 stock market correction](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-analysis-2018/). It started with the Jan. 4 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-you-should-buy-on-the-follow-through-day/) on the S&P 500 **(1)**. That's where IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) switched its market action back to uptrend. The Nasdaq composite enjoyed a 13.4% rally from there for a total of 20.3% from its Christmas Eve bottom.


Along the way, the Nasdaq only [breached its 10-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) once, on Jan. 29 **(2)**. Notably, the S&P 500 didn't breach its short-term moving average line that day and had just a fraction of the loss. The Nasdaq also quickly recovered the next day **(3)** vaulting to a new high for the rally. Not much of a pullback there.


Warning Signs Of Weakness
-------------------------


The recent weakness started with [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-tops/) piling up over the last two weeks. A distribution day is when one of the major indexes falls by 0.2% or more with trading volume heavier than the prior day. It's important to track the number of distribution days in addition to the severity. A pile of distribution days in a short period of time suggests weakness to follow. Sometimes that can be a full-blown stock market correction. Maybe it's just a break for a few weeks with only a few percentage points dropping off the index. You won't know until after the fact. But, the distribution at least puts you on alert.


For swing trading, a leading index breaching the 10-day moving average line is also a helpful indicator. It suggests that at least the short-term outlook might be changing. Especially after a prolonged period of time with the index holding the line.


Current Stock Market Action
---------------------------


Just looking at the last couple of weeks, some warnings started showing. A distribution day on Feb. 28 showed just a 0.4% drop in the index **(4).**After such a long run it doesn't grab much attention. March 4 was more noteworthy because of the wider spread between the highs and lows of the day **(5)**. Even though the Nasdaq only closed down 0.2%, leading growth names took a harder hit. The [Innovator IBD 50 ETF](https://www.investors.com/ibd-indexes/ibd-etf-indexes-ibd-50-etf-leaders-breakout-stocks-etf-ffty-ldrs-bout) ([FFTY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFTY)), a good proxy for growth leaders, was down 1.3% that day. Whether it's a stock market correction or minor pullback, growth stocks tend to get hit harder.


Once the index breached its 10-day moving average line **(6)**, the character of the distribution also changed. The severity of the loss at the close was greater at 0.9%. The index also closed near the lows of its trading range for the day. No quick rebound this time. For SwingTrader, we noted a cautionary stance and warned that further weakness would lead to a switch to [sideways trend in the market action](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/this-old-adage-rings-true-for-sideways-markets/). The reason for stopping short that day was the possibility of support at the 200-day moving average line and the 7500 level.


Those levels didn't hold the next day and SwingTrader switched to sideways trend **(7)**. What does that mean? [Less trading, more caution](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-to-navigate-a-sideways-market/). We had scaled back our buying previously, due to many of the leading stocks taking a break in their runs. With the Nasdaq composite up 10 consecutive weeks, it was difficult to find stocks that weren't extended.


Do these signals indicate a stock market correction is imminent? Not necessarily. If one does occur, the early caution could save you from a significant hit to a portfolio filled with growth stocks. But so far, growth stocks have held their gains well. That points to a minor pullback as a more likely scenario. That's also a constructive outcome. A few weeks of sideways action isn't something you want to be swing trading in. But if it causes leading stocks to tighten up, that can provide fuel for more opportunities to come. Have your watch lists ready just in case.

Rather than hold a stock for a long move, sometimes it's best to take the quick profit when you have it. When ONON stock started running, a 10% profit in one week was enough to satisfy us. Here's how we handled the trade.  
与其长期持有一只股票，有时最好在拥有它时快速获利。当 ONON 股票开始运行时，一周内 10% 的利润足以让我们满意。以下是我们处理交易的方式。




Lacing Up ONON Stock 系带 ONON 股票
-------------------------------


Shoemakers often can change leadership and that seems to be happening now with Swiss-based shoemaker **On Holding** ([ONON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON)). Its last earnings report **(1)** showed a lot of price discovery but started a solid run **(2)**. Rival **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)) led for most of the prior two years but gave up its leadership mantle in May.  
鞋匠经常可以更换领导层，现在瑞士鞋商 **On Holding** （[ONON）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ONON) 似乎正在发生这种情况。其上一份收益报告 **（1）** 显示了大量价格发现，但开始了稳健的运行**（2）。**竞争对手 **Deckers Outdoor** （[DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)） 在过去两年的大部分时间里都处于领先地位，但在 5 月放弃了领导地位。


After a weak start in the stock market for September, ONON stock found support at its 21-day line **(3)**. It then tightened up for the next few days. When indexes showed a big upside reversal on Sept. 11, ONON stock again got support at its 21-day and was an early mover **(4)**. It joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day.  
在 9 月份股市开局疲软之后，ONON 股票在其 21 日线 **（3）** 找到支撑。然后在接下来的几天里，它收紧了。当指数在 9 月 11 日出现大幅上行逆转时，ONON 股票在 21 天再次获得支撑，并且是先发者 **（4）。**它当天加入了 [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH)。

ONON started as a half position as we tested the waters but due to its strength we added another quarter position later the same day after making progress.  
ONON 在我们试水时开始时是半位，但由于它的强度，我们在取得进展后的同一天晚些时候又增加了四分之一位。


We finished our position with another quarter the next day **(5)** making it a full position. ONON was breaking above resistance from its Aug. 27 high **(2)**, but we were already at a 7% gain from our initial entry. We stayed content with our full position and low average cost.  
第二天我们又用四分之一 **（5）** 平仓，使其成为一个完整的头寸。ONON 突破了 8 月 27 日高点 **（2）** 的阻力位，但我们已经从最初的入场点上涨了 7%。我们对自己的全部头寸和较低的平均成本感到满意。


September Starts On Rocky Road九月从崎岖之路开始
---------------------------------------


As ONON edged higher we enjoyed the gains and let it run. But a strong pop on Sept. 18 seemed like a gift that made it worth locking in  some profits **(6)**. We were up 4% from our latest quarter add and we trimmed that quarter. We had an 11% gain from our initial entry.  
随着 ONON 小幅走高，我们享受了收益并让它运行。但 9 月 18 日的强劲流行似乎是一份礼物，值得锁定一些利润 **（6）。**我们比最近一个季度的增长增长了 4%，并且我们削减了该季度的预算。我们从最初的进入中获得了 11% 的收益。


The next day saw the stock reverse the gains and we started selling as it kept dropping throughout the day **(7)**. By the end of the day, we were out of ONON with over a 9% gain in the trade in just under a week.  
第二天，股票逆转了涨幅，我们开始抛售，因为它全天都在下跌 **（7）。**到当天结束时，我们在不到一周的时间里以超过 9% 的交易收益退出了 ONON。


But that doesn't mean we are done with the stock. Usually a reversal like that would lead to more weakness in the short term. And ONON did get worse the next day but then it held tight over the next four days **(8)**.  
但这并不意味着我们已经结束了这只股票。通常，像这样的反转会在短期内导致更多的疲软。ONON 第二天确实变得更糟，但在接下来的四天里它一直保持着 **（8）。**


The tight action is a strong cue that this stock might be ready to go again.  
紧缩的动作强烈暗示这只股票可能已准备好再次下跌。

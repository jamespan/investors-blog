If a friend treated you poorly enough times, you might feel like ending the relationship. Or at least limit the time you spend together. But as much as we ascribe human characteristics to our stocks, they are not people. Which is why Spotify got multiple chances this year even though it didn't work out a number of times.  
如果朋友对你不好的次数足够多，你可能会想结束这段关系。或者至少限制你们在一起的时间。但是，尽管我们将人类特征归因于我们的股票，但它们不是人。这就是为什么 Spotify 今年获得了多次机会，尽管它没有成功过几次。


**Spotify Technology** ([SPOT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT)) gave us a 10%-plus trade earlier this year as [its moving average lines converged](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/spotify-stock-moving-averages-converge/). We tried it seven more times since then with many of the results leading to small gains or small losses. But it's often worth it to keep trying if a stock doesn't break down and the setups are still there.  
**Spotify Technology** （[SPOT）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPOT) 今年早些时候为我们提供了 10% 以上的交易，因为[其移动平均线收敛](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/spotify-stock-moving-averages-converge/)。从那时起，我们又尝试了七次，许多结果导致小额收益或小额亏损。但是，如果一只股票没有崩溃并且设置仍然存在，那么继续尝试通常是值得的。




Summer Shakeouts For Spotify Stock
----------------------------------


After a strong gap-up on its latest earnings report, Spotify gained our interest again. It pulled back slightly, losing little of its gains and then quickly rebounded **(1)**. The relative strength line hitting a new high added conviction. Plus the S&P 500 had a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-bottoms-how-to-invest-using-follow-through-days/) that day. It was enough for us to start a full position in Spotify on [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).  


The 5% jump at the highs the next day looked like we made a good decision, but then it quickly reversed and we exited later the same day with a loss **(2)**. Downside reversals of that magnitude are a big warning sign and exiting prevented us from taking an even larger loss if we had held.  


A dramatic upside reversal on Aug. 5 breached the 50-day line. When we saw a follow-up to the reversal, we tried Spotify again **(3)**. A similar downside reversal happened the next day **(4)**. This time we exited a little quicker in order to keep the trade positive. Instead of falling further, the stock recovered and kept going without us.

We attempted to get back in a couple weeks later **(5)** but the stock never launched. After more than a week without progress we exited Spotify again before the trade went negative **(6)**.  


Fourth Time's A Charm
---------------------


Hadn't we had enough? Three weeks later, we tried Spotify again **(7)**. A strong gap up and a relative strength line at new highs enticed us to start a half position that we brought to a full position in short order. Recognizing increased volatility, we started locking in profits quickly **(8)** and exited completely just over a week from our entry **(9)**. The trade was good for a quick 3.8% and gave us another win under our belt.  


This was actually the 11th trade in Spotify since 2020 for a collective gain of over 40%. Three of the trades were losses. Four produced gains of less than 1%.  


Of the four that worked, they more than made up for the ones that didn't. By keeping losses small, you give yourself the luxury of multiple attempts. Just one of those that turn into a big hit can make solid portfolio progress.

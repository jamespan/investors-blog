Swing trading is not only about keeping losses small. It also requires protecting a profit when you have it.  
波段交易不仅仅是为了保持较小的损失。它还需要在拥有利润时保护它。


Selling into strength or quickly cutting at short-term moving averages protects your portfolio from too much damage. That means we often don't give positions much room to drop before we exit. So what happens if the stock rebounds? That often means buying it right back.  
强势卖出或在短期移动平均线处快速削减可保护您的投资组合免受太大损害。这意味着我们通常不会在退出之前给仓位太多的下降空间。那么，如果股票反弹会发生什么？这通常意味着立即买回它。




Swing Trading Example: XLY波段交易示例：XLY
------------------------------------


Last month, this column analyzed a position in the SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF ([XLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY)). After a solid gain from a postelection bump, we exited the position to protect our gains as it broke below its 10-day moving average line **(1)**. Even though it was rebounding at the time of the article **(2)**, we noted a concern with one of the larger positions in the ETF, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), which had been lagging.  
上个月，本专栏分析了 SPDR 非必需消费品 ETF （[XLY）](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLY) 的头寸。在大选后的暴涨中大幅上涨后，我们退出该头寸以保护我们的收益，因为它跌破了 10 天移动平均线 **（1）。**尽管在文章 **（2）** 发布时它正在反弹，但我们注意到对 ETF 中较大的头寸之一 **Amazon.com** （[AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)） 的担忧，该头寸一直滞后。



But the next trading day, things shifted and we added XLY right back on to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(3)**.  
但是在下一个交易日，情况发生了变化，我们将 XLY 重新添加到 [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **上（3）。**


It's easy enough to look at such a trade and refuse to buy a position just because it's at a higher price than you just sold. But the market is constantly giving you new information. If you don't adjust your thinking, you could see opportunities pass you by.  
看到这样的交易并拒绝买入头寸，仅仅因为它的价格高于您刚刚卖出的价格，这很容易。但市场不断为您提供新信息。如果你不调整自己的思维，你可能会看到机会从你身边溜走。

Using Market Feedback To Adjust Positions利用市场反馈调整仓位
---------------------------------------------------


Not only did we add the position back, we also made it larger once we made progress **(4)**. In this way you get more money into what's working. We are also watching for sell signals on the way up or opportunities to sell into strength.  
我们不仅重新添加了位置，而且在取得进展后还将其扩大 **（4）。**通过这种方式，你可以把更多的钱投入到有效的工作中。我们还在关注上涨的卖出信号或强势卖出的机会。


We had a 10% profit from our entry and a downside reversal in XLY tested our resolve **(5)**. The low of that day gave us a potential exit close to the peak. But XLY kept going higher.  
我们从我们的入场中获得了 10% 的利润，而 XLY 的下行反转考验了我们的决心 **（5）。**那天的低点给了我们接近峰值的潜在退出。但 XLY 一直在走高。


At the next reversal, however, we decided to lock in some profits and reduce the position **(6)**. As is often the case, the ETF kept going higher **(7)**. Though we didn't participate as much, we still retained part of our position. It was another example of the market giving feedback that the position was strong — at least temporarily.  
然而，在下一次反转时，我们决定锁定一些利润并减少仓位 **（6）。**与往常一样，ETF 不断走高 **（7）。**虽然我们没有那么多参与，但我们仍然保留了部分地位。这是市场反馈表明头寸强劲的另一个例子——至少是暂时的。


Fed Reaction Hits Leaders Hard美联储的反应沉重打击了领导人
--------------------------------------------


Fed days can often bring volatility and this last meeting did so in spades. With a portfolio aggressively positioned bullish, the negative reaction Wednesday required cutting losses and protecting profits. We exited our remaining position in XLY at a lower price than our prior sell a few days before **(8)**. While our upside participation was reduced, so was our downside participation when the market started tumbling.  
美联储日通常会带来波动，而上次会议无疑做到了这一点。由于投资组合积极看涨，周三的负面反应需要减少损失并保护利润。我们以低于几天前卖出的价格退出了 XLY 的剩余头寸 **（8）。**虽然我们的上行参与度有所减少，但当市场开始下跌时，我们的下行参与度也有所减少。


But continuing to get market feedback remains important. As money shifted back to leading stocks of the last couple months, XLY saw a nice bounce and support at its 21-day line **(9)**. It gave us another chance to buy the position back on the upside reversal. Now with our entry day low providing a clear area where we can get feedback if we are wrong, we have a low-risk entry with a lot of upside potential. All because we are willing to buy positions back.  
但继续获得市场反馈仍然很重要。随着资金回流至过去几个月的领先股票，XLY 在其 21 日线 **（9）** 看到了不错的反弹和支撑。它给了我们另一个机会，可以在上行反转时重新买入头寸。现在，我们的入场日低点提供了一个明确的区域，如果我们错了，我们可以获得反馈，我们的入场风险很低，有很大的上行潜力。这一切都是因为我们愿意买回头寸。

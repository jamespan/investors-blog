When most people think of swing trading, stocks with big moves and lots of volatility might be what comes to mind. But a recent trade in insurance stocks through an ETF made a fine profit. How do you determine if it's enough? Relative strength is a good gauge as to whether your investment is paying off.  
当大多数人想到波段交易时，可能会想到波动较大且波动较大的股票。但最近通过 ETF 进行的保险股交易获得了丰厚的利润。你如何确定它是否足够？相对强度是衡量您的投资是否得到回报的好指标。




Swing Trading Example: Insurance Stocks波段交易示例：保险股
-------------------------------------------------


Insurance stocks have been one of the sleeper hits of the year. In fact for 2024, the **SPDR S&P Insurance ETF** ([KIE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KIE)) is up 37% vs. 27% for the S&P 500. Even with it being spread out in a generally slow moving space, it has outperformed. And it's been a relatively easy trade. Most of the year, insurance stocks have spent their time above their [50-day moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/).  
保险股一直是今年的热门股票之一。事实上，到 2024 年，**SPDR 标准普尔保险 ETF** （[KIE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KIE)） 上涨了 37%，而标准普尔 500 指数上涨了 27%。即使它分布在一个通常移动缓慢的空间中，它的表现也优于 300 美元。这是一笔相对轻松的交易。一年中的大部分时间，保险股都在 [50 天移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/)上方度过。



The latest venture below the 50-day **(1)** was very short-lived. Just four days were spent under the line beginning on the last day of October. As financial stocks saw a big jump postelection **(2)**, KIE participated but its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) still had a ways to go to retake recent new high territory. By contrast, the **SPDR Select Financial ETF** ([XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)) and **SPDR S&P Bank ETF** ([KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)) had relative strength lines jumping to new highs. That was reason enough to pass on the insurance stocks initially.  
最近一次低于 50 天 **（1）** 的冒险非常短暂。从 10 月的最后一天开始，只在这条线路下度过了四天。由于金融股在大选后大幅上涨 **（2），**KIE 参与了其中，但其[相对强弱线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/)仍有很长的路要走，才能收复最近的新高区域。相比之下，**SPDR Select Financial ETF** （[XLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLF)） 和 **SPDR S&P BANK ETF** （[KBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KBE)） 的相对强弱线跃升至新高。这就是最初转手保险股的充分理由。

A week later, insurance stocks were consolidating gains and the relative strength line shifted. KIE started to look a lot better as its relative strength line poked to recent highs **(3)**.  
一周后，保险股盘整涨幅，相对强弱线发生变化。随着 KIE 的相对强弱线触及近期高点 **（3），**KIE 开始看起来好得多。


The insurance stock ETF joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) the next week as it broke out of its flat consolidation with the relative strength line continuing to trend higher **(4)**.  
保险股 ETF 在接下来的一周加入了 [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH)，因为它突破了平坦的盘整，相对强弱线继续走高 **（4）。**


Quick Trade With Quick Profits快速交易，快速获利
---------------------------------------


With a lot of stocks trending well, we've leaned on some longer holding times than we normally would with swing trading. But we're still taking profits when we have them on plenty of positions. That was the case for KIE. After five consecutive days of gains, we booked our profit on the position **(5)**.  
由于许多股票走势良好，我们依赖于比通常波段交易更长的持有时间。但是，当我们在大量头寸上拥有利润时，我们仍然在获利。KIE 就是这种情况。在连续五天上涨后，我们在仓位 **（5）** 上获利。


Since we were pushing the limits of our exposure at the time, it required careful consideration of where money would be rewarded best in the short term. Between the winning streak and KIE reversing from its highs on the day, it seemed likely that a pause would be in order for the insurance stocks and it let us keep positions elsewhere as well as add new ones.  
由于我们当时正在突破风险敞口的极限，因此需要仔细考虑短期内资金的最佳回报。在连胜和 KIE 从当天的高点反转之间，保险股似乎可能会暂停，这让我们可以在其他地方保留头寸并增加新的头寸。


While usually thought of as too slow for swing trading, the relative strength line during the time of the trade only went higher. That means we got outperformance vs. the S&P 500 by taking on the KIE insurance trade. In the end, the relative strength line is not only useful for determining stocks to get into but also whether the decision was a good one.  
虽然通常被认为对于波段交易来说太慢了，但交易期间的相对强弱线只会走高。这意味着我们通过参与 KIE 保险交易获得了优于标准普尔 500 指数的表现。最后，相对强弱线不仅有助于确定要进入的股票，还有助于判断决策是否正确。

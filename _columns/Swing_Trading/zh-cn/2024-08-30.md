With gold reaching an all-time high north of $2,500, many gold stocks had swing trading setups as a result. Here was a quick profit we made in the VanEck Gold Miners ([GDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDX)) exchange traded fund.




The Setup For Gold Stocks
-------------------------


With gold coming out of a decade-plus [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/), gold stocks had to be on our swing trading radar.



An attempted breakout in the gold miners quickly fizzled **(1)** but that didn't knock them off our radar. The VanEck fund formed a short [double-bottom](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) base and the middle of the "W" shape **(2)** offered a potential entry.

The [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/follow-through-signals-market-uptrend/), on Aug. 13, saw the start of a brief pause in the VanEck fund right under the prior resistance **(3)**. When it punched through a couple of days later, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) crossed recent highs and we added the ETF to SwingTrader **(4)**. We started with just a half position in the gold stocks ETF. We try to let our positions earn their higher weights.


Taking The Quick Profit
-----------------------


The easiest trades are the ones that give you immediate feedback that you are on the right track. How do they do that? They go up. The fund had a nice follow-up the next day and we made it a full position. **(5)**


But then it seemed to lose steam just under 40. Our decision to trim on Aug. 21 was three fold **(6)**. First, we had a good profit and could lock some in. Second, the fund came up sharply from the bottom and the pause under 40 would be a good place for it to digest its gains.


Third, with a number of subsequent follow-through days showing up in the market, we were looking to rotate to faster stocks that could provide more outperformance. We were also noticing that the S&P 500 was on track to trigger a [power trend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-condition-called-power-trend-is-when-you-really-need-to-be-buying/). Another reason to lean into faster-moving stocks.


When gold stocks took another hit the following day **(7)**, we took the remaining half position off. Again, protecting the profits that we had and freeing up cash for deployment elsewhere.


Now that the fund has found support at its [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)Â and showed a little bounce on Thursday **(8)**, maybe it will get another chance. The stocks that we rotated into have had mixed results and we've been seeing a lot of reversals from breakouts and bounces. It's another reason why the quick profit-taking might still be the way to go in the current environment.

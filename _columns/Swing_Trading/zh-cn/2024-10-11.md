Buy low and sell high is often the simple instruction given for stock market success. Or in the case of [IBD Founder William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/william-oneil-legendary-investor-ibd-founder-canslim-creator/), "buy high and sell higher." Swing trading adds another element. Even after a successful trade in a stock, it doesn't mean you can't go back and buy it again. That's what we did with Constellation Energy. Though we got back into CEG stock at a lower price, buying right with this powerful setup was the most important element.  
低买高卖通常是股市成功的简单指示。或者以 [IBD 创始人威廉·奥尼尔 （William O'Neil](https://www.investors.com/news/william-oneil-legendary-investor-ibd-founder-canslim-creator/)） 为例，“高买高卖”。波段交易增加了另一个元素。即使在股票交易成功后，也不意味着您不能回头再次购买。这就是我们对 Constellation Energy 所做的。尽管我们以较低的价格重新买入 CEG 股票，但通过这种强大的设置正确购买是最重要的因素。




A Strong Catalyst For Constellation
-----------------------------------


There has been plenty of excitement about artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency and electric vehicles in recent years. Less talked about, but getting more apparent, is the tremendous energy these technologies will require.  


That's where **Constellation Energy** ([CEG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CEG)) comes in. Its 125% gain for the year puts it right up there with AI giant **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). After trading below its 50-day line during its summer vacation, CEG stock popped back above the line in mid-September **(1)**.  


To put an exclamation point on the importance of power, CEG announced a [20-year contract](https://www.investors.com/news/sp-500-nuclear-inks-microsoft-deal-three-mile-island-restart/) with **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) to power its data centers **(2)**. Notably, the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) flew to new highs along with the price.  


Still, the gap-up over 20% held a lot of risk as a buy point. However, as CEG stock held the gains, it became more interesting. Especially after testing the 250 level and finding support **(3)**.

The next day it cleared the highs of the prior two days and it joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as a half position initially **(4)**. Again, the relative strength line confirmed the strength as it reached new highs with the price.  


As we immediately got traction on the new buy, we added an additional quarter position later the same day.  


Locking In Gains While You Have Them
------------------------------------


Constellation quickly founds its way to a 20% profit zone from its traditional entry and immediately showed a downside reversal **(5)**. We took the opportunity to lock in the gains on our quarter position add just in case weakness followed.  


Initially CEG held **(6)**. But it plunged below its 10-day moving average line the next day and undercut the lows of the last few days **(7)**. It was reason enough to take the profits while we had them with an exit at 266.48.  


Gone But Not Forgotten
----------------------


Our exit looked good, especially as Constellation fell another 6.5% over the next couple of days **(8)**. But leading stocks should remain on your radar. At its lows on Friday, CEG stock found support at its 21-day moving average line and quickly reversed.  


Upside reversals are one of our favorite setups for swing trading. The low offers an easy place to know when you are wrong and the entry is often early enough to get you a cushion before it hits a traditional buy point. In this case, our reentry into CEG stock was over 3% below our exit price. While it's nice to get back into a stock at a lower price, it was the setup itself that was the decision maker. Buying right is more important than buying low.

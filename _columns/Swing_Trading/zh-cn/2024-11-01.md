Indexes ran into some trouble this week as they plunged below their [21-day exponential moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). It's a reminder how booking some profits when you have them can help weather some of these storm clouds. **Clear Secure** ([YOU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YOU)) wasn't broken by any means and isn't far from all-time highs. But exiting when we did avoided getting shaken out of Clear Secure stock at a worse price.  
指数本周遇到了一些麻烦，因为它们跌破了 [21 天的指数移动平均线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/)。这提醒我们，当你有利润时，预订一些利润如何帮助度过其中一些风暴云。**Clear Secure** （[YOU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YOU)） 没有以任何方式被打破，距离历史高点不远了。但是当我们退出时退出，可以避免以更糟糕的价格从 Clear Secure 股票中被淘汰。




Advantage Of Pullback Over Breakout回调优于突破的优势
--------------------------------------------


Want to improve your sell decisions? One of the best things you can do is improve your buy decisions. In this market environment, we've been favoring pullbacks over breakouts. But we like to wait for the strength to come back in before we make our purchase.  
想要改善您的销售决策？您可以做的最好的事情之一就是改善您的购买决策。在这种市场环境中，我们一直看好回调而不是突破。但是我们喜欢等待力量恢复后再进行购买。


With Clear Secure, our entry on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) came after the stock retook its [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) **(1)**. YOU stock cleared the highs of the previous four days, including the day it dipped below the 21-day. We started with a half position and then as it cleared resistance around 33, we added to the position **(2)**.  
有了 Clear Secure，我们在股票重新夺回 [21 天线](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) **（1）** 后进入 [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH)。YOU 股票清除了前四天的高点，包括跌破 21 天的高点。我们从半位开始，然后当它在 33 附近清除阻力位时，我们增加了位置 **（2）。**

The entry decision gives you two advantages. First, if the stock went back below the 21-day line and didn't follow through on the strength, you would know quickly the trade wasn't working. The exit would take a smaller hit to the portfolio as you could keep a tight stop and the position size was smaller.  
进入决定为您提供两个优势。首先，如果股票回到 21 天线下方并且没有跟进强势，您很快就会知道交易没有奏效。退出对投资组合的打击较小，因为您可以保持严格的止损并且头寸规模较小。


Second, by the time the breakout across resistance occurs, you already have a little cushion. The add is smaller so it doesn't move your average cost up too much and keeps your cushion intact. The larger position in stocks that are working allows you to make a bigger difference in your portfolio when you're right on your buy decision.  
其次，当突破阻力位时，您已经有一点缓冲。添加的较小，因此它不会将您的平均成本提高太多，并保持您的缓冲完好无损。在有效的股票中持有更大的头寸可以让您在做出正确的购买决定时对您的投资组合产生更大的影响。


Selling Decisions For Clear Secure StockClear Secure Stock 的出售决策
----------------------------------------------------------------


When making sell decisions, it's wise to ditch the idea that you will sell at the top. That's rare.  
在做出出售决定时，明智的做法是放弃您将在顶部出售的想法。这种情况很少见。


For Clear Secure, we started trimming on a strong gain after the stock had run up 7% from our initial entry **(3)**. With a portion of profit locked in, you can let the stock wiggle a little more and still exit with a positive trade.  
对于 Clear Secure，在股价从最初的入场价 **（3）** 上涨 7% 后，我们开始削减强劲的收益。锁定部分利润后，您可以让股票多波动一点，并且仍然以积极的交易退出。


With the benefit of hindsight, the trim doesn't look great since Clear Secure jumped again the next day **(4)**. But by making incremental decisions, the market gives you feedback. Was it a bad sell and the stock goes up more? Well, at least you still have some participation. Does it go down after you sell? Well, do more of that selling since the market gave you feedback that it was a good decision. You can also continually move your stop up so that if you do come off the top quickly, you reduce the drawdown.  
事后看来，自从 Clear Secure 第二天再次跳跃 **（4）** 以来，修剪看起来并不好。但是通过做出渐进式决策，市场会给你反馈。这是一次糟糕的抛售，股票上涨得更多吗？好吧，至少你还有一些参与。卖完后会下跌吗？好吧，多做一些销售，因为市场给你的反馈是一个不错的决定。您还可以不断向上移动止损，这样如果您确实快速从顶部出来，您可以减少回撤。


After showing some stalling action the next day **(5)**, we made our final exit on Clear Secure at a higher price than our initial trim **(6)**. Part of the decision came down the stock being down sharply on a day where the indexes were up and near highs.  
在第二天表现出一些停滞动作 **（5）** 后，我们以高于初始修剪 **（6）** 的价格在 Clear Secure 上进行了最终退出。部分决定是下跌的，股票在指数上涨并接近高点的当天大幅下跌。


Sitting Out While A Stock Consolidates在股票整合时袖手旁观
------------------------------------------------


Pullbacks are great for entries but not as much fun to sit in. Our exit allowed us to watch Clear Secure pull back below the 10-day line without taking the hit to the portfolio **(7)**. Most likely holding it longer would have just created an exit at a worse price and a bigger drawdown. With YOU stock running into resistance at its old high **(8)**, we can watch this one from the sidelines until we see another opportunity.  
回调非常适合入场，但坐着没有那么有趣。我们的退出使我们能够看到 Clear Secure 回调至 10 天线以下，而不会对投资组合造成打击 **（7）。**持有更长时间很可能只会以更差的价格和更大的回撤退出。随着 YOU 股票在旧高点 **（8）** 遇到阻力，我们可以在场边观察这只股票，直到我们看到另一个机会。


That's especially attractive to be on the bench as [earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) and the election are around the corner in less than a week. Two events that could add extra volatility to stock positions.  
坐在替补席上特别有吸引力，因为在不到一周的时间里，[财报](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/)和选举就要来了。这两个事件可能会增加股票头寸的额外波动性。

Stock market corrections can be hard to navigate. If you sell everything, you might miss out on the inevitable bounce back. Try to stand pat, and you can quickly see hard-fought gains turn to losses. The nimbleness of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) offers a chance to participate when the odds are in your favor. But the strategy is quick to back away when they're not. Half positions, like recent trades in Domino's stock, can help find the balance when the environment is treacherous.




Swing Trading Example: Domino's Stock
-------------------------------------


**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) made a strong move at an inopportune time. After its fourth-quarter earnings report, DPZ stock saw more than a 25% gain **(1)** on a [breakaway gap](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/). It was [Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/dominos-pizza-earnings-q4-2019-dominos-pizza-stock/), a topic of discussion on [IBD Live](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&src=A00433A&refcode=pdsoc%7Cggl%7Cibdlive%7C2019%7C11%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C985802&intcode=invstcntnartcls|cms|ibdlive|2019|11|ibdlive|na|682843) and also earned a spot on IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and [Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/) list. On [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH), our focus was on unwinding positions that day as we locked in profits and cut losses on all but one stock. But Domino's was on our radar.


On Feb. 24, indexes started off strong and DPZ stock was a candidate to increase exposure **(2)**. The mild pullback relative to the market saw Domino's get support at the lows of the breakaway gap **(1).** The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) remained near highs. But with the Nasdaq composite hovering around its 50-day moving average line after a big gap down, there was still reason to be cautious.


Half Positions Help Balance Risks
---------------------------------


With the market down so much so quickly we expected a bounce. Having little exposure would prevent our participation and cause us to lose ground vs. the broad stock market. But if the market got worse, we would benefit from low exposure by sitting out the turmoil. Our compromise was a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/) with Domino's stock. We still put our stop loss at an undercut of the day's low at 363.70. That would keep the loss small for a normal position but the half position reduced the risk even further.

The strength in early trading didn't last and the market quickly looked like it would roll over. Rather than wait for the stop loss to get triggered we took Domino's stock off early at 364.39. It was technically a day trade, which is unusual for us, but sometimes necessary. We'd rather act when we need to rather than hold a stock longer to avoid a day trade.


Of course the problem with tight stops is that you might have the stock turn around and recover right after you sell it. That will happen and that's OK. We are managing our risk given the information we have and being flexible as that information changes.


Domino's Stock Gets Another Try
-------------------------------


The Nasdaq composite got support at its 200-day moving average line by the end of the week. The next week the strength continued and we were in a position again where a strong market rally could eat away at our outperformance due to our lack of exposure. Domino's stock was still a prospect as the relative strength line remained near new highs. It would be easy to skip it after just taking a loss on it. But we try to approach each trade with a fresh set of eyes and no bias. So we tried again with another half position **(3)**.


We started to get profitable but then saw a number of bearish reversals, including Domino's stock **(4)**. We sold ahead of our stop loss again to minimize our loss even further. This has been our strategy since our peak on Feb. 19. We've had 12 half positions since then with 10 of them as losses. Small losses. The result is that since we treated each half position as a 6.25% weight in a portfolio, we only lost 2.1% off our peak close. The S&P 500, by contrast, is down 12.3% from its peak close. The losses we've taken lately have been test buys, and the half position with tight stops ensured we didn't get hurt.

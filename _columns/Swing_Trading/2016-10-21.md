Earnings season can be problematic for a swing-trading style. A large loss due to lousy earnings or guidance could potentially wipe out many hard-fought profits. That makes buying a stock right before earnings ill-advised.


While the market was rallying in July, IBD's SwingTrader had to pass on more than a few proper setups because earnings were looming. But options could allow for some of these setups to be played. A call option could be purchased that would limit your risk while letting you profit from a big move up.


Take **Chemours** ([CC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CC)) in its August move. This stock had been on SwingTrader at the end of July **(1)**. While that trade didn't work out, the stock set up again in a couple weeks. Keeping stocks on your radar can lead to a quicker response time on future setups. Chemours bounced off its 50-day moving average with little volume but a few days later the stock saw a volume surge **(2)** as it started moving higher Aug. 8 **(3)**. The problem with this setup was that earnings were being reported after the close that day.


Here is where an option strategy could help. Near the close of Aug. 8 Chemours was trading around 9.31 and the Aug. 19 call option just out-of-the-money at the 10 strike was trading for around 40 cents. Take the option premium and divide by the current stock price to figure out your maximum percentage risk on the trade. For Chemours, that equaled about a 4% maximum risk by buying the option instead of the underlying stock. No matter what happens, the most you can lose is the price paid for the option.


Chemours killed it on its earnings announcement, coming in with earnings of 27 cents per share vs. estimates of 17 cents. The stock gapped up the next day and closed at 10.30. The option increased 30 cents with eight days left until expiration. At this point, the option could be sold and the profit immediately booked or action in the underlying stock could be used as a guide to holding and selling decisions. Chemours continued to increase until expiration **(4)**, never closing below its 5-day moving average, making it a pretty easy hold. At expiration on Aug. 19, the stock was up to 12.38. The option could have been exercised or sold at any point along the way for a healthy profit.


[SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) just added functionality to allow for potential option trades like Chemours for subscribers. The alerts clearly specify that it is an option trade. This is important because the biggest purpose behind the strategy is to avoid the big downside stock risk before an earnings event. Setups may be similar to those found in the [Earnings Preview Column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) but with a swing trading focus.


While this functionality is now operational, it may be used sparingly this earnings season if the market continues its sideways trend.


Real-time alerts on stock and option setups are available to subscribers and trialists of SwingTrader. [Free trials](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) are available.

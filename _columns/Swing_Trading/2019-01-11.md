It's hard to make progress in the market if you can't cut your losses when they are small. A few oversized losses can wipe out the progress of many profitable [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). Using a short-term moving average can help.




Using A Moving Average To Cut Your Losses
-----------------------------------------


Before you enter a trade, you should always have an exit strategy in place. Where will you [cut your losses](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/) to protect yourself? When do you [take profits to keep your gains](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-average-lines-swing-trading-stock-profits/) rather than risk giving them away? You need a line in the sand, and a moving average can be that line. While many traders pay the most attention to the 50-day moving average, a [shorter-term moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/) is more appropriate for swing trades. The 5- and 10-day moving averages fit the bill since swing trades normally last five to ten days.


A stock that crosses below a short-term moving average, after closing above the line, may be giving an early signal that its uptrend is in jeopardy. If it happens quickly intraday but recovers, that isn't as worrisome. Waiting until the end of the day is a good way to avoid these inevitable shakeouts. However, a stock that looks weak at the end of the day, trading decisively below its moving average and near the lows of the day, is suspect. It can be sold at the end of the trading session, especially if volume accompanies the drop.


Swing Trade Example: Deckers Outdoor
------------------------------------


Take **Deckers Outdoor** ([DECK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DECK)). It joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) as a [half position](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/half-positions-are-not-signs-of-commitment-issues/) off a reversal Dec. 26 **(1)**. The [larger-than-normal risk percentage](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-swing-trade/) in a new rally attempt led to the half-position decision. We were [playing defense](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/herbalife-stock-swing-trading/) before this trade and didn't want to lose our outperformance over the market by allowing large losses. Deckers staged a powerful move above the 5-day moving average and it didn't give up much ground over the next few days.


On Jan. 2, Deckers stock fell below the 5-day moving average but recovered, closing back above the moving average by the close **(2)**. We held through the day of price discovery, but the next session it wasn't so lucky. Market weakness put pressure on the nascent rally and Deckers wasn't immune. Even though it was well above the low of its entry day, [a useful stop loss level](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-china-trade-war-baozun-stock/), it was on track to be a decisive close below the 5-day moving average **(3)**. It exited SwingTrader before the close to give subscribers time to act.


When the market staged a [follow-through](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) day on Jan. 4, Deckers suspiciously didn't participate. It fell further below its 5-day moving average and also took out its longer-term 50-day moving average **(4)**. If you didn't cut your losses already, it was another warning sign that it wasn't acting like a winning stock.


On Jan. 10, Deckers finally took out the low of its entry day **(5)** as its weakness continued. The early removal decision served two purposes. Not only could you cut your losses sooner, you also freed up capital to participate in other trades. That's much better than sitting in a laggard stock risking more losses and missed opportunities. **Planet Fitness** ([PLNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLNT)) for example, joined SwingTrader on Jan. 4 and we already [took some profits](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/take-profits-quickly-bearish-stock-market/) within three trading days.

For swing traders, losses can be like clouds. If you have too many and they are too large, they can overshadow a once bright portfolio. We can't control the weather but we can control our losses by using trading rules.




  So far this year, IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) has seen mostly sunny days. The win rate stands at 62%, largely because we [avoided the 11.7% correction](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sell-rules-put-swing-trader-cash-stock-market-correction/) in the Nasdaq composite by going to cash on Feb. 1. We've been taking modest gains averaging over 6% quickly, with the average trade length coming in at seven trading days. We did let one stock, **Fibria Celulose** ([FBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FBR)), rally 20% above our entry price before removing it. Our net gain was closer to 15%, since we took half profits on the way up. That stock was also the longest held at 15 trading days.


But just as important as piling up winners, we've kept the average losers to just 2%. [Keeping losses small](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-stock-losses-protects-portfolio/) is what lets big winners like Fibria shine. That's why we always have a stop loss set from the start and we employ flexibility to take a loss earlier if warranted.


Take **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), a recent loss on SwingTrader. The stock had a number of things going for it when we added it March 5. It [broke out](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of what looked like a downward sloping [handle](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/common-patterns-1/), volume was the heaviest in six months and the [Relative Strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) hit new high ground **(1)**. The market also was following through on a bullish [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/), and the [industry group](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/make-sure-your-swing-trades-share-this-one-factor/) was showing strength as it broke out.


Despite all the things going for it, the next day showed a worrisome character change **(2)**. Our gain of 2.5% vanished even though the market was forging ahead. We were still well above our stop loss with volume lighter than the massive volume on the breakout. But the negative action deserved a response. We took half the position off for a small loss.


The next day, CF Industries gapped down at the open. After giving it a few minutes to stabilize, we exited the remaining position at our stop loss price of 42.49 **(3)**. Rather than taking a 3.1% hit on the trade, the earlier removal of a half position shaved the loss to 2.3%. As the next two trading days unfolded, the stock dropped another 7.5% from our average exit price **(4)**. Letting a loss get that large can seriously damage a portfolio. Employing rules to avoid big losses keeps the sun shining on your portfolio.

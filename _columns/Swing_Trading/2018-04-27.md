[Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) can avoid a lot of stock market corrections but it doesn't make you immune. Choppy markets are especially tough to maneuver. So even if you don't make much progress, you want to make sure you don't lose your hard-fought gains. Here are some rules we used in April to keep our outperformance for the year strong.




Swing Trading Success In The First Quarter
------------------------------------------


First, let's revisit how IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) started the first quarter with strong outperformance vs. the S&P 500. We kept the [gains of a strong January](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sell-rules-put-swing-trader-cash-stock-market-correction/) by selling on the way up and going to cash at the beginning of February **(1)**. A [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) **(2)** on Feb. 14 and a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) in March **(3)** provided opportunities for more strong gains for those two months. Again, [locking in profits on the way up](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-avoided-stock-market-correction/) **(4)** saved us from taking a big draw down. The Nasdaq composite, by contrast, saw two 10% corrections back-to-back. As a result, we showed strong outperformance vs. the S&P 500 for the first three months of 2018.


This latest rally started at the beginning of April, and making progress hasn't been easy. Even the start was suspect. The first day of the rally attempt **(5)** was an inside day. The previous day's high was higher and the low was lower. Inside days suggest indecision and by themselves don't provide much evidence of direction one way or another. If you can't even break free from the trading range of the previous day, what does that say about your prospects for establishing a trend?


Even when the Nasdaq composite started making progress, [bearish reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) **(6)** thwarted buys every step of the way. It seemed each buy on strength hit resistance and showed signs of failure the next day. Headlines tossed markets back and forth. Therefore, finding stocks that could withstand the gyrations was like the needle in the haystack problem.


Finally, the major stock market indexes seemed to find their footing and broke above their [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) **(7)**. The swing trading setups also increased. The problem? The venture above the 50-day line only lasted three days. As indexes broke back below the line **(8)**, more losses hit. The result was a low [batting average](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/) in April.

**IBD'S TAKE:** *Even a low batting average can outperform the market if your wins are larger than your losses. That's what happened in March for IBD's SwingTrader. Take a [free trial](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) today.*

Swing Trading Survival Strategies
---------------------------------


How is a swing trader to survive? The most important thing is [keeping your losses small](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/cutting-losses-is-key-to-long-term-stock-profits/). The average loss for April was below 2%. We also [kept our positions to a minimum](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-to-navigate-a-sideways-market/). The highest exposure at any one time in April was two full positions and two half positions. With proper [position sizing](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-can-help-balance-risk-and-reward/), that translates to a portfolio just over half invested. The reduced exposure wasn't an accident. Exposure should increase only as your trades prove that you are right. Hence, lack of progress leads to lack of exposure.


It's reasonable to expect that you won't outperform the market every month. But you don't want to take large draw downs. That's why defense becomes critical. By keeping losses small and limiting exposure, we preserved the solid outperformance of the first three months.

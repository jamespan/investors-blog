If at first you don't succeed, try and try again. You might not use that philosophy for an individual on one of **Match Group's** ([MTCH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MTCH)) dating apps, but it was a winning strategy for the [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/).




Match has already seen two tries on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) this year. The first was on Jan. 2 as it [broke above](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) an area of resistance on the highest volume in nearly a month **(1)**. What followed was constructive behavior: tight action holding right at the 5- and 10-day moving averages. The problem? The market was having a huge start to the year and Match didn't participate. It exited on Jan. 16 after losing its five- and 10-day lines but before it hit its stop loss **(2)**.


It was an easy decision, especially as the stock lost another 2.4%. But that doesn't mean it was without frustration. Match hit its 10% profit goal two weeks later **(3)**. Holding through the weakness would be a flagrant disregard of rules and a logical re-entry didn't really present itself. Plus, the market's run created an extended environment and an earnings report was on the horizon for Match **(4)**. After some initial weakness, Match went on to a 20%-plus move after earnings.


If this had been a dating experience, it might have been ended with a box of stuff getting thrown in a bonfire. It's important to remember that stocks aren't people. Leading stocks give multiple opportunities for profit. If your timing is off on one attempt, it doesn't prevent you from turning it around on the next try.

That's what happened with this stock. A pullback in Match, and the market, presented a new opportunity with a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) on March 2 **(5)**. SwingTrader added it again and sparks flew immediately. We booked half profits two days later after getting a penny shy of the 5% profit goal **(6)**. Another three days and Match hit its 10% profit goal **(7)**.


The stock exited SwingTrader on March 9 but the trade setup noted that its fresh breakout could warrant holding Match longer. The biggest factor in its exit wasn't the stock itself but the extended nature of the market. It corresponded to the Nasdaq composite moving more than 6% with six consecutive gains and SwingTrader getting more cautious as a result.


The caution proved prudent as markets pulled back this past week. Match, however, continued to make gains **(8)**. Its relative strength is keeping it on our radar. Who knows, maybe we'll get another chance with Match?

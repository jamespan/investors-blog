Ever wonder what stocks we're looking at for [SwingTrader](https://get.investors.com/swingtrader/?intcode=start%7Cstart%7Cprdmcst%7C2021%7Cna%7Cst%7Cna%7C%7C397709&src=A011LPH) ideas? This swing trading watch list will let you sneak a peek.


Our focus is on trade setups where we expect to hold for a short period of time and take profits quickly.


This list includes stocks currently on our radar. However, even some of the best setups might not make it onto our current trades list with an alert to subscribers.


We treat the current trades list like a portfolio. When we already have enough exposure, we may pass on a stock on this list. We also have higher liquidity requirements due to the number of subscribers that might act on an alert. As an individual investor, you have more freedom. This swing trading watch list includes a wider net for you.


Also, earnings season may have an effect on whether some of these stocks make it to our current trades list. When earnings are due soon, we'll wait until the report is out before acting. But, we might keep them on the swing trading watch list since the earnings report could provide a catalyst for action.


Ultimately, our goal is to help our subscribers make more money in the stock market. We hope the extra ideas will help you achieve more success along with our educational tools: the [SwingTrader FAQ](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-position-sizing-tips-ibd-swingtrader-platform/), the [weekly swing trading column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/swing-trading/), the monthly SwingTrader Scorecard webinar and the trade setups of the [current](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) and [past trades](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/past) on SwingTrader.

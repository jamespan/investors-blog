With the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly every day the last two weeks, you might be scratching your head on what happened to your portfolio. **Universal Display** ([OLED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OLED)) stock was among many growth stocks showing a major divergence from the indexes. They were taking big hits while value stocks found favor. Your sell rules on individual stocks can minimize damage before the stock market indexes flash sell signals. That's how we ended up cutting losses early on OLED stock.




Swing Trading Example: OLED Stock
---------------------------------


The decision on selling actually begins before you even buy a stock. You should understand a little of the personality of a stock. How volatile is it? Does it have a steadiness to its moves or does it make punctuated big moves followed by flat action? When looking at Universal Display stock, you should know that 10% of the days in the last 12 months had moves of 5% or more at the close, and nearly double that for intraday moves greater than 5%. The largest moves topped 20%, both up and down, in a single day.


When we added OLED stock to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) we knew these fact going in and hoped to take advantage of it on the upside. Our add came as the stock bounced off its 50-day moving average line and showed a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) from a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-flat-base-power-waiting-to-erupt/) **(1).**This also coincided with the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 clearing their 50-day moving average lines for the first time in a month.


The next day the stock market consolidated its gains with flat action, but we were up nearly 4% on our position at the peak of the day **(2).** This is where we start preparing to [take at least some profits at 5%](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/). But then Universal Display stock reversed. It was still up for the day but gave up a lot of ground. Knowing the personality of OLED stock, we knew the swing wasn't unusual but were still on guard because of the [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/).


Early Selling Minimized Damage In Universal Display Stock
---------------------------------------------------------


Things got ugly from there. We saw severe losses across many of the leading growth stocks and we decided to reduce our position by half early on **(3)**. Even though the indexes weren't showing any problems, OLED stock showed signs of failing as it fell back to the buy point around 218. Our [stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-china-trade-war-baozun-stock/) was at 212, a 4.5% risk percentage. That's on the higher side for a [swing trade.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) A reduction around 218 helped minimize the risk percentage. But it still gave the volatile OLED stock room in case it found support at the buy point.


Stick To Sell Rules: No Excuses, No Emotion
-------------------------------------------


As the day wore on, the damage got worse. We removed the remaining position once it hit the stop loss. The early sell reduced the loss to just 3% instead of 4.5%. That means less damage to the portfolio. There are plenty of times that OLED stock has immediately bounced back after a sharp loss, but our stops are there for a reason. There's always the possibility that things could get worse and we don't want to suffer needlessly.


Things did in fact get worse for OLED stock. The next day saw nearly a 10% drop as it sliced through the 50-day line **(4).**It's easy to freeze up and tell yourself that the worst is over. But things can always get worse. Ignore sell rules enough times and you'll most likely find out the hard way.

There are many factors that go into when to sell stocks. Selling on strength or weakness typically gets the focus. But what about when a stock goes sideways? When [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/), how much time does a stock deserve if it's not making progress?




From the outset, it should be clear that sideways action in a stock is often a good thing. A stock that consolidates its gains after a run can benefit from the break. It builds a platform for the next move up. But when swing trading, time is essential. You don't want to waste it sitting in a stock that isn't moving. Having rules for when to sell stocks takes your risk off when the potential gains are more uncertain.


Swing Trading Example: Alarm.com Stock
--------------------------------------


Take **Alarm.com** ([ALRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALRM)), a recent trade on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). It saw about a 20% move in January as it formed the right side of a base. Just over a week of sideways action led to a big move with the heaviest [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) in three months **(1)**. We put it on SwingTrader as it [broke out](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) into new high territory. Alarm.com stock was up nearly 3% from our entry at its high that day but then struggled to make progress. The 5-day moving average line offered a level of support but 65.50 turned into a line of resistance.


Nearly two weeks passed without profits rising above the level of the entry day. Typical swing trading doesn't normally hold positions beyond two weeks. That should naturally shift your thinking to when to sell stocks. Your goal at that point is to keep your profit rather than trying to increase your profit.


When To Sell Stocks That Don't Move
-----------------------------------


A few factors made the decision even easier. One of our swing trading rules uses a decisive close below the 5-day moving average line as a criterion for when to sell stocks. The first close below the moving average didn't qualify as decisive **(2)**. Alarm.com stock was less than 0.2% below the line.


The following day, Alarm spent a lot of the trading day below the 5-day moving average line as well **(3)**. As the trading day ended, we decided to remove Alarm from our list. At the time it was right around its 5-day moving average line. We gave the stock 10 days on our list and weren't up any more than the first day. Trading volume dried up significantly suggesting that while there wasn't a lot of institutional selling, there wasn't buying either. Finally, an earnings report was about a week away. As a swing trading rule, [we don't hold through earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-before-earnings-protects-your-portfolio/).


The removal might seem contradictory. After all, it has elements of what we look for in stocks we consider adding. But, the add always comes with a catalyst of price and volume action that shows the sideways move is over. Without that catalyst, it becomes a decision of when to sell, not add.


Alarm.com Stock Gets Worse
--------------------------



Our early removal helped retain profits. The next day saw a decisive drop below both the 5- and 10-day moving averages **(4)**. Alarm.com also dipped below our entry price early in the session. Once the earnings report came out things got even worse. Alarm.com stock punctured its 60.30 cup buy point dropping more than 10% intraday. It's a valuable lesson that anything can happen after an earnings report. That kind of drop can devastate your performance. A large loss can wipe away a number of smaller profits. You waste time trying to claw yourself back to even. Finally, it can damage your psychology. Either making you more timid for fear of losing again or wreckless as you try and get your revenge. Sure there are plenty of examples where you see a commensurate move for a gain. But the risk outweighs the potential reward. Far better to avoid the situation entirely.

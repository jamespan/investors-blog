The best house guests don't overstay their welcome. They come, have a good time, and leave before becoming a nuisance. It's the same conduct of a good [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/).


Taking profits on the way up helps ensure you don't overstay your welcome in a trade and also helps reduce your risk of getting caught in a normal pullback. Even in the best uptrends, stocks don't usually go straight up. Call it catching their breath, or get more statistical and call it mean reversion, but the behavior is readily observed. Stocks take breaks on the way up and the length of those breaks vary — as short as a few days or lasting weeks to months. Rather than hold the position through those breaks, taking profits frees up capital for other potential setups and at the same time reduces the risk of losing money as the stock settles back toward its trend.


What should trigger the profit taking? Either using a set percentage goal or a set time frame can help make the decisions more automatic. Both require less subjective interpretation. Taking profits at 5% to 10% profits is usually a fairly easy bar to surpass in a short period of time, depending on market conditions. As long as losses are kept small, those types of gains can keep your portfolio humming along. Holding trades within a five- or 10-day time frame is also the norm for a swing trade. Implement these rules automatically and you won't vacillate when it comes time to pull the trigger.


Profits also should be taken when a stock changes its character. This rule is more subjective and can be more difficult to implement, but with practice, can significantly reduce profits dwindling away.


Take, **Cognex** ([CGNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CGNX)), a recent trade on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). On May 2, the stock saw a strong breakout from a four-week consolidation after its earnings report **(1)**. It was added to SwingTrader at 88.50. It was a little slow out of the gate, and after six days closed just about even with the entry day close **(2)**. The stock also seemed to be hitting resistance around 90.50.


Cognex broke through its resistance but volume was lackluster. When it hit its 5% profit goal on May 15, half profits were taken at 93.02 **(3)**. The automatic profit taking locked in profits right near the top. The rest of the shares ended up being removed at the end of the day around 91.35 due to a few factors.


Most important was the character change for the day. What started as a fresh breakout looked more like stalling by the end of the day. Volume was unimpressive throughout most of the day but picked up as the stock closed at its lows. Not a good sign. Cognex also was up five days in a row, so some type of pullback would not be unusual. Finally, it was the 10th day of owning the stock. Without a compelling show of strength, it was hard to justify holding it longer.


Taking profits on Cognex on May 15 helped sidestep the huge market losses of May 17 **(4)**. Of course we didn't know the drop was coming on that day or the extent, but it is amazing how much carnage can be avoided by systematic profit taking.

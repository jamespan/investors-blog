It's been a tricky market lately. Grabbing the profit when you can is sometimes the best course of action in these situations. Any clues that help you avoid losses or periods of flat action are worth studying. Here's how a bearish reversal in FND stock helped preserve [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) profit.




Swing Trading Example: Floor & Decor Stock
------------------------------------------


The home specialty retailer **Floor & Decor** ([FND](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FND)) came on the scene as an IPO stock (initial public offering) back in 2017. It already had a solid earnings and revenue history and caught our interest a number of times for potential swing trading. Most recently, FND stock set up with resistance around 50 this summer **(1)**. Weeks passed and the stock just kept trading tighter and tighter. That is the price movements showed less movement between the highs and lows. The closes stayed in a narrow range as well.


We put it on our watchlist for [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on Sept. 23 and it cleared the resistance the next day **(2)**. It looked strong in the morning so we started with a half position at 50.83, then followed up with the second half at 51.10 as it continued to show progress. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) **(3)** crossed into recent high territory at the same time suggesting leadership potential for FND stock. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-speaks-volumes-for-trades/) showed a recent spike a few days prior and remained heavy **(4)**.


Taking Profit In FND Stock
--------------------------


Profits came immediately and we came within 37 cents of our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) the next day **(5)**. Then FND stock showed a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/). A 4.4% gain for the day ended up less than 1%. Be suspicious whenever you see a wide trading range that gets to new high ground but ends up closing in the lower part of its range. Weakness usually follows.


The stock market also looked like it was getting in trouble. It closed down 1.5% and broke below its 50-day moving average line. The loss of the gains for the day coupled with a potential stock market correction wasn't the environment to be aggressive. [We exited while we still had a 1% profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) on the trade.


A bearish reversal isn't always a death sentence. Weakness may follow but be temporary. Or a catalyst can change the sentiment and quickly shake off the negative action of the reversal. In the case of Floor & Decor stock, it hovered around our exit price for another few days. Then, it had a decisive close below both its 5- and 10-day moving averages and fell below our entry **(6)**. Waiting it out could easily have turned the small profit to a loss. It hasn't traded above 50 since.

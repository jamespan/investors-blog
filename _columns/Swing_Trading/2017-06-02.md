You've got a healthy profit in a stock and are counting on the gains to keep rolling in. But what do you do if your stock opens down and keeps falling instead?


It's a situation that happens in [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). Whether it's news on the individual stock or market turmoil, stocks take hits. Sometimes a stock may fall precipitously before you can even figure out what's driving the selling. By the time you do figure out the why behind the move, you could be down even more.


This is where a predetermined exit strategy is an essential tool for success. Most important, it takes the emotion out of the trading equation. Making sell decisions ahead of time, rather than in the heat of the battle, favors rational thought over hopes and fears.


Speed in taking action is another benefit. Thinking through potential scenarios ahead of time allows you to react quicker when it's time to sell. Saving time can ultimately save you money, especially in a stock that's dropping fast.


Two rules are used regularly in IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) to protect profits. First, booking profits when you have them prevents unrealized profits turning into realized losses. Think you might be able to get more out of the stock? Take partial profits. It reduces your risk while still allowing some participation if the stock continues to rise.


The second rule involves raising our stop as profit targets are hit. We don't want to let good gains get completely taken away or, worse, turn to a loss. Currently, when we hit a profit goal of 5%, we usually try to exit with a profit of at least 1% on the trade so we still make some meaningful progress.


Both rules were applied with **Chemours** ([CC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CC)) last month. The stock was added on May 12 at 43.72 as it broke out of a short consolidation **(1)**. The next day **(2)**, the stock already hit the first profit goal of 5%, and half profits were taken at 45.93.


On May 16, the stock had a weak close as it reversed from its highs for the day **(3),** hitting resistance at 46. The action was suspicious but occurred in lower volume. The fact that some profits were already taken meant there was already a level of risk reduction.


The market got hit hard on May 17 and Chemours came down with it quickly after the open, dropping more than 6% intraday **(4)**. Rather than wait for a close below the five-day moving average, it was sold after it hit the raised stop.


Employing both sell rules left a 2.5% gain for the trade using the average exit price. Waiting longer was worse. The stock eventually pulled back all the way to its 50-day moving average **(5)**.

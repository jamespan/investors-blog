When you hit your first price target quickly in a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/), often the next question is "now what?" Obviously the strong start could signal more gains to come. But what if your stock starts heading south?




A quick move up can fall back to earth just as quickly. When to sell stocks and where to set a stop-loss is best turned over to rules, not emotions. By raising your stop-loss as you go along, you protect profits and prevent a good trade from going bad.


From the beginning of our [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) launch in 2016, we've always tried to keep profits when we have them. A recent trade in **Trade Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) stock was no different. Trade Desk stock joined SwingTrader on Sept. 25 as a [bullish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) but looked more like a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/breakouts-buying-stocks-swing-trades/) by the end of the day **(1).** We added it just below 148. We noted the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) making new highs **(2)** and [trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-clues-complement-price-action-for-stocks/) tracking well above average **(3)**.


Trade Desk Stock immediately rewarded investors with a 5% move that same day and we took half profits (**4)**. That portion of the trade qualified as a day trade, but those occurrences happen infrequently. Certainly not often enough to designate you as a pattern day trader. There's a big difference in a [swing trading vs. day trading strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/day-trading-versus-swing-trading-comes-down-to-time/).


Rule For When To Sell Stocks: Hit The Price Target, Raise The Stop-Loss
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Taking half profits at a 5% price target is just the first part of protecting profits. Taking a little off the table still allows you to participate if the move continues, but protects at least some of the profits if the stock falls. The second element is raising the stop-loss once you reach a price target. Starting with a 1% profit from your entry ensures that you still leave the trade with a decent profit. Our 1% profit with the raised stop for Trade Desk stock was 149.34.


Consider this. Our original [stop-loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stop-loss-china-trade-war-baozun-stock/) for Trade Desk was 142.16, the low of the entry day. From our entry, it was a little larger than normal at a 4.8% risk for the trade. Once you start seeing significant progress the stop-loss deserves an adjustment. There is no reason to let a solid profit turn to a loss, especially if that involves a 10% drawdown. Why allow that kind of loss to your portfolio?


A couple of days after our entry, Trade Desk nearly hit its 10% price target before flashing a [bearish reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) **(5)**. That preceded an even more dramatic fall over the following days and triggered the raised stop-loss **(6)**. No thinking required at that point because you have a rule in place.


This was just another case where [the raised stop-loss saved you from a steeper fall.](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) Due to sell rules, like the raised stop-loss, the list of stocks on SwingTrader dwindled quickly from seven stocks on Sept. 26 to just one stock by the end of Tuesday. From a portfolio perspective, that avoided the hard hits the market suffered most recently. You often find that individual sell rules naturally push you out of harm's way. You preserve your capital and are in a better position for the next swing trade opportunities.

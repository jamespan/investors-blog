Selling into strength is a common theme in this [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) column. That can apply to the stock market indexes as well. Looking at the Nasdaq 100 or an often used proxy, QQQ, you can see the benefit.




A Market Call Using QQQ
-----------------------


No matter how bad things get in the stock market it's useful to remember that a turn can be on the horizon in as little as four days. Just over a month ago, market indexes looked like they were getting in trouble, trading for weeks below their 50-day moving average line by the time they made a low **(1)**.


As bad as it looked, just eight days later there was aÂ [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on Oct. 14 **(2)**. There was a strong price move, over 1%, with volume coming in higher than the previous day.


Our exposure was light at the time so we added the ProShares Ultra QQQ ETF ([QLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLD)) to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day. This gives double the daily performance (up or down) of QQQ and can be a quick way to make a larger bet on the market strength.


Adding to the conviction, there was a subsequent follow-through day on QQQ just a couple of days later **(3)**. It had all the criteria of a follow-through day, in price and volume, very early from our market signal.


Selling Into Strength
---------------------


An important note on follow-through days; they don't all work. But this one did on QQQ, even better than expected. We took our first third of profit on the leveraged QQQ position with over a 6% gain **(4)**.


The reduction in our exposure to QQQ helped when there was some sideways action over the next few days and our position closed below the 5-day moving average line **(5)**.

Keeping the position paid off and QQQ pushed higher. But we still took another third off for profit-taking when we hit 10% profit **(6)**. Notably, this was also a downside reversal that had the look of stalling for QQQ.


When Is It Too Much Of A Good Thing?
------------------------------------


Holding our double of QQQ was easy over the next week. We held above the 5-day moving average line consistently with gains piling up day after day.


After nine consecutive gains, QQQ started looking extended **(7)**. It was approaching 7% above its 50-day line, a level that historically coincides with pullbacks. We took the remainder of our position off with a 20% gain from our entry.


Selling into strength sometimes means watching gains happen without you. In this case, it was only one day. Our decision seemed even better by the close as QQQ looked like it was putting in another stalling day **(8)**.


As QQQ pulled back as expected, the leveraged ProShares ETF fell even more, 6.7% from the top **(9)**. Selling into strength avoided the drawdown. If the pullback is temporary, as we expect it will be, we could see another opportunity to have another market play in the future.

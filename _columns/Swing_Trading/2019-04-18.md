Growth stocks took some beatings this past week. Were there signs giving investors an early warning? MongoDB stock provides an example of getting out before a fall.




Swing Trading Example: MongoDB Stock
------------------------------------


The first quarter of 2019 was phenomenal for [growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/best-growth-stocks-buy-watch-ibd-stock-lists/). [Earnings reports](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/should-you-buy-stock-ahead-of-earnings/) acted as catalysts that started many of the strongest moves. That was the case for **MongoDB** ([MDB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MDB)) stock when it vaulted more than 25% in March **(1)**. And it didn't stop there. The database software stock saw nothing but gains over the next five days as it tacked on an extra 18%.


MDB stock pulled back about 15% over the next couple weeks and showed signs of an upside [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/reversal-days-swing-trading-buy-points/) **(2)**. That day tested the lows and staged a comeback, closing in the upper third of its trading range. Normally on a reversal you see a wider spread between the high and low for the day, but it was still a solid gain of over 2.5%. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-clues-complement-price-action-for-stocks/) was a little weak though. A surge in volume, especially compared to recent volume, usually indicates institutional support and continued demand.


Following up on the reversal, MongoDB stock rose more the next day. Volume accompanied the move this time and we added the stock to [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) that day **(3)**. Our entry was at 140.83 and by the close of the day, we were already up 2%. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) wasn't poking to new highs **(3)** but with reversals after pullbacks, that isn't unusual.


Early Sell Signal On MDB Stock
------------------------------


The next three days MongoDB went sideways **(4)**. It couldn't get above 145 and got turned away at each try. That by itself wasn't an issue. With its surge after the pullback, a breather can be constructive for a new leg up. And the tight action kept the stock above its [five-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/). But we also had a concern. The stock market's strong move made the indexes extended. Software stocks, as the clear leaders, were particularly ripe for a potential pullback.


We used the stock's character as our guide. Since MongoDB stock traded tightly, a change from that action would tell us more. A [strong break above](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) 145 would suggest a move in the right direction. A break below the tight area could portend further weakness. On the intraday chart, the area just below 142 provided near-term support. That also corresponded to just below the five-day moving average and just above the 10-day moving average and would allow us to keep about a 1% gain. The short-term focus is appropriate for swing trading but creates tighter stops than you would want for position trading.


Once it traded below 142, we removed MongoDB stock **(5)** as leadership started faltering. Our exit was 142.16. By the end of the day, leaders continued lower and MDB stock ended at 138.14. That was decisively below its five-day moving average line and below our entry. It fell the next day below the entry day low and the day after that undercut the pullback entirely. Recognizing the change in character early preserved a small gain rather than taking a loss that just got worse.

A tiger on the hunt for food can offer lessons to traders on the hunt for profits. Specifically, employing patience improves your chances of success.


With spectacular speed and the ability to leap great distances, the tiger must use its energy wisely since it's limited in how long it can run and how many big jumps it can take. Just like a trader has limited capital to deploy, the big cat needs to be strategic in getting the best payoff.


Trading more frequently in the right market environment and less often when conditions are less than ideal is one example of the proper use of patience. Normally you want to wait until you have a whole herd of trades to choose from rather than a solitary setup. That's what a trending market provides: a herd of opportunities.


But a sideways market requires careful stalking. Price, volume and other technical factors have to be almost perfect to warrant a trade.


Tighter restrictions in **[IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH)** product boosted the batting average recently, even with the market making little progress. Fewer names were put on while the market went sideways and a string of losses acted as an early warning system for a tougher market.


From June 28 through July 28, 17 trades were put on in 21 days, about 80% of the days a trade was put on. The first 13 saw only two losses but the last four all ran into trouble starting with trades on July 22. The market was still edging up, but more caution was needed and tighter restrictions were employed on trades.


The next 21 days through the end of August saw only 10 trades, less than 50% of the days a trade was put on. That included one short, **Kirby** ([KEX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KEX)). Focusing on just a few carefully chosen targets resulted in just three losses.


Patience can pay off in any market environment. In most trading days, numerous opportunities are available and always vying for your attention. An anxious trader can pounce too soon or too often and be saddled with weak trades in an otherwise strong market. Stocks that look great in the morning can reverse and turn ugly in the afternoon. Using intraday charts to get a confirmation of the strength and sustainability of the move leads to better success rates.

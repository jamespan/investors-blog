One big challenge of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) is that when market turmoil hits, you generally have less cushion to ride out the storm. Shorter-term trading requires quicker action on the defensive side but also justifies being on offense by taking profits methodically on the way up.


Take **Illumina** ([ILMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ILMN)), a stock originally under consideration on Nov. 22 **(1)**. It [broke out](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of a [short consolidation](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/bases-overview-1/) that was part of a larger consolidation, with resistance just above 214. Volume came in at the highest level in 10 days **(1)**, but since the resistance went back further we were looking for volume above its 50-day average. Being the day before the Thanksgiving holiday, light volume wasn't unusual, but still warranted waiting for heavier trade.


On Nov. 27, after the holiday, the stock came out strongly on volume more than twice its average **(2)**. That earned Illumina a spot on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). By the day's close, the stock was already up nearly 2% from our entry. That type of early lead usually indicates a winning trade, if you can handle it right.


Three days later, Illumina hit the 5% profit goal and we took half profits at 230.63. That's our offense. Booking the profits early protects your trade from potential sharp drops that could threaten your overall gain. As it turned out in this case, that profit-taking transpired less than 10 cents from the top **(3)**.


As is customary, we also [raised our stop to a 1% profit level](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) from our entry. Once we've seen solid gains, we don't want to let them wither away. That's our defense.


A couple days later, markets got a scare. An [erroneous report](https://www.investors.com/politics/columnists/abcs-brian-ross-should-be-fired/) came out that Trump top national security advisor Michael Flynn's guilty plea to the FBI would also implicate the president concerning contacts with Russia during the campaign.  The market reaction threatened to take away profits in our trades, and we focused on defense by locking in those gains. We didn't wait for a breach of the raised stop but took profits on the remaining position while we still had a 1.7% gain **(4)**.


Markets and Illumina recovered ground by the end of the day, but turmoil continued the following day **(5)**. For those that were still in the stock, rather than taking the early profit, a breach of the raised stop at 221.85 demanded attention. While profits were lost, it was certainly better than the day's close at 213.45. The lows of the day breached the original stop loss and there was no reason to let a good trade go bad. As it stood, our profit for the entire trade averaged out to a respectable 3.3% in five days.


There was also no reason to waste time holding the stock and hoping for a comeback. A month later, Illumina is still below our final exit price and our original entry **(6)**.

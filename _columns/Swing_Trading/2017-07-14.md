Past performance may not be indicative of future results, as many disclaimers will tell you. But if you ignore your past trades, you miss out on a valuable tool to improve your results.


The market gives you objective feedback on how you are doing through your account — are you making money or not? Adding additional metrics for analyzing [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) lets you know what to focus on to nudge that report card in the right direction.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWING_071717-300x266.png)Your batting average can be one metric particularly useful for gauging success. It's simply a count of your winning trades vs. your losing trades. You may use different ways to determine how many trades to include. A straight number like 10 to 15 trades can give you a good idea of how you've been doing lately or you might use a function of time. Look at trades going back for the last month or year or even from a particular change in market conditions.


Take recent past trades from IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH). Going back 10 trades shows a 90% batting average. You could also go back to April 24, when the market broke out into new highs from nearly two months of sideways action. That adds a few more trades and puts the batting average at 85%. Those metrics are higher than usual for a few reasons.


The market rally that started on April 24 proved to be good for a quick 5% gain in the Nasdaq composite, the leading index, in just over a month. The market is a strong influence on your batting average. In contrast, the 10 trades before April 24 had more losers than winners as the market traded sideways through much of March and April.


That hit to the batting average encouraged a more cautious approach during the April-May rally. The caution paid off when the market dropped sharply on May 17 and June 9 [(a point covered in this column a couple weeks ago)](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/watching-from-the-sidelines-is-best-in-sideways-markets/).  Fewer and carefully chosen trades in June also led to the batting average staying at a high level even when the market was going sideways.


The batting average by itself is not enough. It's also important to be aware of how your average winner compares with your average loser. If you are taking outsize losses, you can still lose money with a phenomenal batting average. By contrast, [keep your losses small](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/keeping-losses-small-is-critical-to-portfolio-progress/) and you might find yourself making money with fewer than half your trades being successful.


Since April 24, average winners were at 2.7% and losers were at 2.2%. While not much of spread, the higher batting average with few losers meant that it was more than enough to make progress in the portfolio. The spread was even better for the last 10 trades at 2.7% for the winners and 0.9% for the sole loser. Coupled with a 90% batting average, that could make significant progress if maintained over a larger number of trades.


These metrics suggest we might have benefited from putting more trades on during that period. But on the other hand, these metrics certainly benefited from the careful approach to the market during this time. In either case, the feedback opens areas of inquiry and insights that drive your improvement as a trader.

Have you ever missed a stock and stopped looking at it because it kept going up without you? Force yourself to keep watching. You'll often get another chance, especially with [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/). That's what we did with Wix stock and it paid off.




Swing Trading Example: Wix Stock
--------------------------------


**Wix.com** ([WIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WIX)) initially looked interesting on May 6 with a powerful [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-on-the-rise-breakout-stocks/) **(1)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) confirmed the surge with a move to recent highs **(1)**. But we passed on the trade. We already had heavy exposure and earnings were just one week away. The stock kept going higher, including a 14% jump after its earnings report **(2)**.


What do you when the train has left the station? Wait for the next train.


After hitting 200, a brief pullback in Wix stock gave us our chance. We put it on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) on an upside [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) **(3)**. Granted, it wasn't much of pullback but we viewed that as a function of its strength.

Selling On The Way Up
---------------------


We quickly hit our [5% profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trade-stocks-take-profits-quickly/) in Wix stock the next day and we took partial profits **(4)**. Selling one-third of the position on strength gives you the bulk of shares left in case the gains continue, but protects some profits in case the stock reverses. The stop moved up from the entry day low to our entry price. When you get solid profits that quickly, you want to make sure you keep them.


Wix stock advanced another 3.3% the next day **(5)** and we took off another third. With this much strength, our goal was to let the remaining position run as long as possible.


A dramatic sector rotation started to take hold on May 26 and that changed our plan **(6)**. Wix stock was the strongest of our holdings so we kept it that day. But as the drop in growth stocks worsened we shed the remaining position before it hit our entry price **(7)**.


The shakeout was short and Wix stock already has snapped back to new highs. But locking in a 5% gain for the average exit in under a week's time is still a good outcome. Especially considering the protection we gave ourselves in case the weakness continued.

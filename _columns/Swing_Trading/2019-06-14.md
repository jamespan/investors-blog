After a strong start to the latest stock market rally, we took a little pause in the latest week. [Swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) MSCI stock nailed a quick profit and avoided the pullback.




Trade-war fears remain a large part of the concern with the stock market, not to mention the impact of tariffs on the economy as a whole. But as [threatened tariffs against Mexico seemed to find a reprieve](https://www.investors.com/news/stock-market-rally-mexico-tariffs-buzz-fed-rate-cut-facebook-google-antitrust-fears/), the stock market found support and staged a comeback starting on June 4. With uncertainty still swirling, it was difficult to make a big commitment in capital that could easily be subjected to the latest news headline. Swing trading can offer some participation along with nimbleness to provide an element of protection.


Swing Trading Example: MSCI Stock
---------------------------------


The first step is to find stocks holding up well with strong relative strength. **MSCI** ([MSCI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSCI)) stock was a good example. As the stock market rally started, the provider of investment analytics and indexes showed a [reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) at its 50-day moving average line **(1)**. With continued progress in the stock market, we added MSCI stock to [SwingTrader.](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) It surpassed the high of the reversal day in [heavier trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/how-much-trading-volume-is-enough-in-swing-trades/) **(2)**. While the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 both dropped below their 200-day moving averages, the fact that MSCI held above its 50-day moving average led to its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) hitting new highs well before the price **(3)**.

The stock market notched a [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) on June 7, and [The Big Picture switched its stock market outlook](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) to confirmed uptrend. MSCI stock reached the 5% profit goal the following trading day **(4)**. With swing trading, this is a good time to book at least some profits. For the remaining position, you would like to give it more room to run. But you also don't want to lose the gains you have. [Raising your stop loss](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/a-rule-to-prevent-good-trades-from-going-bad/) on the trade helps achieve this goal. We tend to go for a 1% profit from our entry as our line in the sand for protecting profit. Taking half profits at 5% and a raised stop at 1% profit for the rest sets you up for at least a 3% profit on the entire trade.


Exiting Early To Protect Profit
-------------------------------


Another useful tool to protect profit is using [short-term moving average lines](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/which-moving-average-is-best-for-profiting-on-swing-trades/). In the current stock market environment, we've gravitated toward exiting at a decisive close below the five-day moving average line. As the stock market struggled around its 50-day line, MSCI stock fell sharply and triggered that sell signal **(5)**. Sure, it could come right back. But the accompanying heavy volume **(5)** with the sell-off suggested that there would be some weakness. That proved to be the case as the stock eventually fell below our raised stop a couple days later. MSCI stock still hasn't regained the level of our final exit. In this case, the moving average line provided an earlier exit and an extra 1% profit for the trade.

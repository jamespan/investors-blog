The link between crisis and opportunity has been cited by politicians from John F. Kennedy to Rahm Emanuel, but such juxtapositions are something regularly witnessed by traders as well. When the prevailing wisdom proves wrong, there can be violent reactions in either direction. Identifying when the trend has changed is key to profiting.


Just in the past year, markets reacted to a vote that astonished investors when the U.K. decided to leave the European Union and when the U.S. presidential election went in favor of Donald Trump. Another case may present itself after the French presidential election next month.


The key to profits lies less in interpreting the economic and political ramifications of such events, but rather the technical action of the markets and individual stocks. The chart is the window into the investor's soul. Recognizing [reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) in those moments can keep you in line with changing trends. It's not about trying to catch the bottom, but identifying the bottom after it's been made and the trend has reversed. A swing trade can provide a quick capture of profits in those moments of transition.


Take the move in **Dycom Industries** ([DY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DY)) shortly after the Brexit vote. The stock got clipped along with the market in a forceful drop but then rebounded sharply **(1)** on June 28. Though it was a positive day, up 3.5%, the close was still below the previous day's high so action wasn't taken at that time. The next day, however, saw continued strength on volume even higher than on the downturn **(2)**. The stock was added to [IBD's SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) at 88.51.


Dycom held its ground for a few days and finally reached the 5% profit level on July 7, so half profits were taken **(3)**. The stock seemed to be on its way to quickly hit 10% profits but fell short by 10 cents.


A profit-taking alert went out for the remaining shares at 96.84 even though shares were still trading above the five-day moving average line **(4)**. A key reason behind the decision was the look of resistance forming just under the 10% profit level for three days and persistent closes in the lower half of the trading range.


Though Dycom closed below the five-day moving average the next couple days, it wasn't in a decisive manner. That didn't come until July 19 **(5)**. But giving the stock extra room would have cost you an extra 3%. The argument could also be made that the patient investor could have seen the full 10% profit by waiting. But that fulfillment didn't come for another four weeks **(6)**. In the meantime, you not only put your capital at risk but also tied it up in lieu of other opportunities. That can be a crisis in itself.

Industry group strength can make or break a [swing trade](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). The best trades often have a confluence of a great stock, in a strong group, with a market in an uptrend. Weakness in an industry group that was previously showing strength can be an early warning sign that it might be time to part ways.


The solar stocks provide multiple opportunities for profit, but also supply many pitfalls along the way. Regulations, trade relations with China, and prices of energy commodities like oil, natural gas and coal can all influence how the stocks act.


Most recently, news centered on a petition to restrict imports on solar panels, specifically targeting cheap imports from China. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled Friday that these imports were harmful to U.S. solar panel makers. That means tariffs might be on the way.


**SolarEdge** ([SEDG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SEDG)) joined IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) Sept. 12 as the stock [reversed](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) strongly near its 50-day moving average line **(1)**. Volume was at its highest in over a month **(1)**. In addition, the solar industry saw a number of its high profile names setting up in bullish chart patterns. The industry group itself went from the top 20 of IBD's 197 Industry Groups to the top five.


That combination got our attention for a potential swing trade. The timing gave the trade just under 10 days before the ITC decision. Note that SolarEdge produces direct current inverters, which it sells to solar installers rather than selling or installing panels for residential or commercial consumers.


Over the next few days, the stock was up nearly 4% from our entry but showed a bearish reversal back to its 5-day moving average **(2)**. Volume was lower on the day **(2)**, so it wasn't enough to incite a panic, but definitely deserved a more watchful eye. Meanwhile, group mate **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) wasn't following through on its breakout.


Things got worse a couple days later as the stock went through both its 5- and 10-day moving averages and came back to its entry intraday **(3)**. Though volume was low again **(3)**, the biggest names of the industry group were retreating as First Solar's [breakout](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) neared a trigger of the [7% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-sell/limit-losses/). Individual sell signals on your stock coupled with a weakening industry group will usually suggest an exit on its own, but the looming ITC ruling sealed it. We removed the trade with a slight profit as it started to rebound at the end of the day.

Machinery, agriculture and cyclical. Not exactly the terms you would use to look for exciting swing trading ideas. Deere stock ended up as an exception.




Swing Trading Example: Deere Stock
----------------------------------


The stock market has threatened sector rotation for a while now. Between optimism surrounding coronavirus vaccines and a simultaneous spike in cases, it's been tough to get a gauge on the winners of the future. Should you focus on stay-at-home prospects or go back to the real economy stocks?


**John Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) seemed to thread the needle well. We added it to SwingTrader after it had a strong bounce off its 50-day moving average line **(1)** during a stock market pullback. The relative strength line on DE stock stuck out near new highs with the stock well below price highs.


The election brought an extra level of uncertainty to the market but DE stock continued to make progress. We took a third off on Election Day with over a 3% profit **(2)** but when the stock showed weakness the following day, we shed a little more out of caution.


When Deere stock quickly recovered **(3)**, we decided to try and get a larger gain out of it.


Unusual Activity For DE Stock
-----------------------------


On Nov. 9, **BioNTech** ([BNTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BNTX)) and **Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) announced the latest results from their coronavirus vaccine and the effect on the stock market was dramatic. DE stock was up 7.4% early in the session and quickly reversed **(4)**.


It would have been a good spot to take the final third in profits, as we did on unusual strength in August for **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)). Having missed the opportunity, we adjusted our game plan.


Many times, we use a short-term moving average to help lock in profits before they disappear. With just a third left, we usually switch to using the 10-day moving average. In this case, there was a lot of distance down to the 10-day.


Another option is to set a line in the sand, say at the low of the previous day or two. In this case, the wild reversal day seemed like a logical area **(4)**. A close below that level could be another trigger for booking profits and exiting the trade.


Exiting The Trade
-----------------


With an inside day following, there wasn't much reason to act **(5)**. Deere stock closed well enough, especially relative to the general market indexes. Deere remained above the low of the reversal day and well above the 5-day moving average line.


The next day undercut the low of the reversal, but closed above it and in the 40% closing range **(6)**. That's a signal of potential support. DE stock earned an extra day.


We exited on Nov. 12 when it looked like Deere stock would close below our line in the sand **(7).**A 16% gain at the peak was down to an 8% gain from our entry. Due to the earlier profit taking, our final gain for the trade was 4.5%.


The stock did recover **(8)** but hasn't gone far since then **(9)**. Plus, earnings are due before the market open on Nov. 25, giving us limited time for future gains. We got a wilder ride in Deere stock than we expected, but came out with a decent profit in a short period of time and it fulfilled its purpose.

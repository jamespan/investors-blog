Selling into strength can be tough for beginning [swing traders](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). You think about the stock continuing to go up and not the risk of downward or sideways action.


However, making a habit of taking profits as they come can keep your portfolio moving forward, free up cash for new trading opportunities and avoid the risk of letting a good trade go bad.


Take **Yandex** ([YNDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YNDX)), an early trade of IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) from 2016. We put the stock on as a current trade on May 31 at 20.41 as it [broke out](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/short-term-stock-breakout-strategies-have-familiar-rules/) of a short four-week [consolidation](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/chart-reading/) **(1)**. Volume was tracking at its highest level in over three weeks when we sent the alert out. By the close of the day, we already had a gain of nearly 1%.


The stock closed flat the next couple days but then started moving. On June 6, just four days after putting the stock on, we took half profits at 21.40 as the stock hit our 5% profit goal **(2)**. As usual, we also raised our stop to a 1% profit from our initial entry.


Taking half profits is helpful because it locks in some gains and sets up a win-win situation for the rest of the trade. If the stock goes up, you will still participate in the move with your remaining shares. If the stock goes down, your earlier sell protects some of the profits and offsets any subsequent drop. The raised stop means that in most circumstances you will exit the trade with at least a 3% gain for the entire trade (averaging the 5% and 1% profit).


Yandex continued to move up and reached its 10% profit goal on June 8 at 22.45 **(3)**. We could take profits on the remaining shares or see if we could stretch the gains out further. This is where having half profits already safely realized can help give a stock some extra room. We raised the stop again, this time to the 5% profit level, and let the stock run a little more. Using the intraday chart we observed some weakness and ended up selling that day anyway at 22.96, just 1% off the top. That stretched the profit to 12.5% on the remaining shares and the gain for the total trade was 8.7% in seven days.


The next day the stock was pretty flat **(4)**, but on June 10 it fell more than 5% and closed below the 5-day moving average **(5)**. That action would trigger a sell on weakness, leaving you with less profit and a little regret on what could have been.


It's also worth noting that Yandex entered SwingTrader again over six months later at 22.99, just 3 cents above the final sell. Selling into strength avoided months of no progress, and keeping Yandex on our radar let us [profit from it again](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bending-with-the-breeze-to-maximize-profit/).

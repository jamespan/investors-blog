Between earnings and a market pullback, swing trading hasn't been easy. But reducing exposure in names like Novocure stock last week helped protect our profits this week. Keeping NVCR stock profitable and avoiding big drawdowns is a key part of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) strategy.




Swing Trading Example: NVCR Stock
---------------------------------


**Novocure** ([NVCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVCR)) has a compelling story. [Offering hope for curing cancer](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/nvcr-stock-why-medical-devices-maker-watch-2021/), it's not hard to imagine NVCR stock becoming a big winner. But for swing trading purposes, our goals are more modest.


NVCR stock joined [SwingTrader](https://get.investors.com/swingtrader/?intcode=start%7Cstart%7Cprdmcst%7C2021%7Cna%7Cst%7Cna%7C%7C397709&src=A011LPH) on Feb. 2 after getting support at its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-a-key-reference-for-investors/) and crossing above its [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) **(1)**. The relative strength line held up well during the market pullback at the end of January and we were still looking to increase exposure after shrinking below 10% invested. Notably, the volume for Novocure stock was the highest level in 10 days **(1)**.


As the end of the trading session was drawing near that day, NVCR stock was already up 6% from our entry. We took a third of the position off to book some profit. We aren't normally involved in day trades, but we try to lock that first third profit while we have it.


A couple of days later, Novocure had a nice rise but gave most of it back by the close **(2)**. We weren't as concerned by this [downside reversal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) as we still were early in the rebound and the tight closes can be viewed as a positive in that context.

By the next week, we hit 10% profit and we took off another third of profit **(3)**. With just one third left of the position and a 10% gain, we often try to give stocks more room to run. We'll also use the [short-term 5- and 10-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/moving-average-lines-swing-trading-stock-profits/) as a guide for protecting our profit.`


A More Serious Downside Reversal
--------------------------------


A few days later, Novocure stock had a more serious downside reversal **(4)**. Not only did it close down for the day this time, it also was an [outside day,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-an-outside-day-in-stock-charts/) closing near its lows. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite looked like it hit resistance around 14,000 on that day.


However, NVCR stock was still above its 5-day moving average and our exposure was already getting light again as we sold into the market strength. We gave it more room.


A few days later and Novocure stock looked like it was getting support at its 5-day moving average line and bouncing from there **(5)**. The lows of the past three days were also forming a line of support around 181.


Out Before Earnings
-------------------


On Feb. 17, we exited the remaining position in NVCR stock. It undercut the support area around 181 and its 5- and 10-day moving averages **(6)**. While it got support at its 21-day line, we were also concerned about the market conditions being ripe for a pullback and earnings for Novocure due the following week.


NVCR stock bounced off its 50-day and went up after our exit **(7)**. But a few days later it was even further below our exit **(8)**. [After Novocure announced earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvcr-stock-novocure-earnings-q4-2020/), the stock fell sharply **(9)** and well below our initial entry. We locked in an 8% gain for the trade and avoided the drawdown with simple swing trading rules.

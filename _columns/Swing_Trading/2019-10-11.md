The stock market hasn't been easy lately. The risk of sticking your neck out often doesn't work in choppy markets. But the nimbleness of [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-basics/) can help by darting in on potential turns but exiting quickly if things don't pan out. That was our approach with a recent trade in TPX stock.




Swing Trading Example: TPX Stock
--------------------------------


With swing trading, we often don't wait for the classic breakout from a consolidation that's lasted for months. If there is an early indication of a trend change, that can be enough to take advantage of the shift. Take **Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) last month. You could draw a short-term trend line along the highs of TPX stock starting in July and going through September **(1)**. On Sept. 11, it clearly broke above that trend and closed above its 50-day moving average line **(2)**. [Trading volume](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/volume-speaks-volumes-for-trades/) was above average and the highest in more than three weeks **(3)**. Our entry on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) was at 77.93.


After a brief one-day pause, TPX stock was on the move again. It climbed as high as a 2.5% profit before reversing and closing in the lower part of its trading range **(4)**. It's important to recognize [bearish reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/bearish-reversal-days-swing-trade/) because weak action tends to follow.


A bearish reversal, also known as a downside reversal, will usually show a wider spread between the high and low trading price for the day. It pops its head into recent high territory and can't hold onto its gains. A bearish reversal may still close positive but in the lower part of its range, or even worse can end up in negative territory.


Tempur Sealy Takes A Nap
------------------------


The bearish reversal in TPX stock put us on alert and when the weakness continued the next day we had a decision to make. Given the choppy market environment at the time, we didn't want to be aggressive with our holdings. We could either [take a small profit](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/take-profits-quickly-bearish-stock-market/) while we had it or wait to see if it would come back. We opted for the former and removed TPX stock as an active trade **(5)**.


The stock flirted with its 5-day moving average a few days, followed by an attempted surge that didn't last long. Another bearish reversal preceded a break of the 50-day moving average line **(6)**. Had we waited, our small gain could have turned into a larger loss. But more importantly we avoided dead money for the next three weeks. While TPX stock held up relatively well, holding the stock would leave you exposed to an indecisive market that could turn at any time.


Time To Wake Up?
----------------


Just because a stock leaves your portfolio, doesn't mean it has to leave your attention completely. Tempur Sealy looks like it's making another rally attempt above a trend line. The stock market also potentially hit the inflection point discussed in [last week's column on the market outlook](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-correction-or-new-rally/). By keeping it on our radar we had the opportunity to give it another try. Some of our best swing trading involves [returning to the same stocks multiple times](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/going-back-to-the-well-can-compound-stock-profits/). Our entry was within a quarter of our exit. So we still have the chance to participate without the three weeks of risk. That can help your sleep at night as much as the mattress.

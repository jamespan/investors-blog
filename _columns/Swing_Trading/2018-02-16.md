Market-timing, trend-following, and [swing-trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) strategies rely on buying stocks while they are going up and sitting out when they correct. It's easier said than done, but if successful, you can gain an edge in performance while at the same time reducing your risk.




 The past two weeks saw a quick, sharp correction that ruined the look of many chart patterns as fear skyrocketed. This followed one of the strongest January's on record, even more notable since it followed such a strong 2017.


IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) avoided the correction and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) demonstrated how swing trading can work strongly in your favor.


Nvidia was no stranger to IBD readers with [numerous appearances](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-did-top-chip-stock-nvidia-rank-1st-in-this-growth-stock-screen/) on IBD's growth screens and a number of trades on IBD's SwingTrader. It's made entrances already twice this year. It joined on Jan. 18 **(1)** as the stock made new highs from an eight-day consolidation following a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/). Nvidia neared its 5% profit goal but seemed to run into resistance at 240. We took profits a little early at 4% **(2)** due to the resistance and the extended nature of the market at the time.


We were looking for a 10% profit on the remaining shares but the stock seemed to hit resistance again at 250 then fell more than 2% the next day **(3)**. The drop put Nvidia decisively below its 5-day moving average and on its way for a potential close below its 10-day moving average. The removal also left SwingTrader without any active trades. Profit taking on the way up in January reduced our holdings from six down to zero.


When the market fell sharply on Feb. 2, we had profits locked in. As the market continued to fall the next week, with the Nasdaq composite off its high by 11.7% at its worst, exposure was minimal.  **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) made a brief appearance on SwingTrader that lasted only one day when [its reversal attempt didn't work out](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sell-rules-put-swing-trader-cash-stock-market-correction/) immediately. As for Nvidia, we gave back more than 3% from its high when it exited SwingTrader. Three days later, the stock opened down 18% from its high and below its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average/) **(4)**.


But Nvidia proves itself over-and-over and a strong bullish reversal made it look poised for another run **(4)**. The initial reversal wasn't playable since an earnings report loomed after the close on Feb. 8. However, a strong reaction to the earnings **(5)**followed by a follow-through day in the market led to it rejoining SwingTrader **(6)**. The entry was 238.80, just below our final sell at 239.25 on the previous trade **(3)**. Getting back in at a lower price is nice, but not nearly as rewarding as avoiding the sharp correction.

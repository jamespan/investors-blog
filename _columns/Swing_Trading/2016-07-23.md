Of all the market indicators, an often overlooked one is how your portfolio is doing. This is where some hard numbers add objectivity, rather than relying on selective memory of your wins and convenient forgetting of your losses. Enter the batting average.


We'll use real-time trades from IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) product as an example. On May 9 **(1)**, the market looked like it was reversing higher after a mild correction. Four names were put on, and one, a short play, was removed for a loss. Only one other stock was on for a total of five stocks by the end of the day. It looked like the market might be turning, and on May 10 the Market Action was upgraded from a Downtrend to Sideways.


However, of the four added only one lasted more than a week and provided a decent gain. Two were sold for small gains, and the other was sold for a loss. A batting average of .750 for the small sample size of four drifted down to .467, with the next 11 trades put on the next week and a half **(2)**. Even solid gains were transitory and quickly turned to losses. The Nasdaq closed above its 10-day multiple times, and it would be back down below it the very next day. The price action, plus feedback from our batting average, kept the Market Action at Sideways with the instruction to use reduced position sizes.


Trades entered from May 18 **(2)** to June 2 **(3)** saw a marked improvement. Those 16 trades eventually experienced two news-related losses, two failed short plays and two mild losses. That's a batting average of .625, with the 10 gains more than making up for the losses.


June 10 **(4)** saw a sudden shift of the Market Action to Sideways. Four names were removed from SwingTrader, leaving only two, one of which was a short play. Interestingly, during that winning streak of trades added from May 18 to June 2, profit-taking had naturally reduced the number of names on the list from a high of 11 down to six on June 9. When profits are taken but there aren't many setups to replace them, you will often find yourself shielded from quick turns like this.


The Nasdaq remained below its 10-day moving average for the next two weeks, making it an easy call to keep the Market Action at Sideways. The SwingTrader list was kept small, with a maximum of three names at the close of any particular day. On June 23 **(5)**, the Nasdaq did close above the 10-day, but with the Brexit vote pending, the list remained at just three names, two of which turned to losses.


Names started getting added again to SwingTrader on June 28 **(6)**, and the batting average quickly improved to .833, with 10 of the next 12 trades showing gains. While the batting average is a lagging indicator, it still provides a useful metric for market health.

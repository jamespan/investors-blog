Taking half profits on the way up is a key strategy of [swing trades](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/). Sometimes, it also makes sense to start the trade with a half position.


Buying early in a trading session poses a dilemma due to the increased volatility of what some refer to as "amateur hour." If you buy early, say on a strong [gap up](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-buying-great-stocks-on-a-gap-up-is-sound-investing-strategy/) at the open, you risk the trade pulling back, filling the gap, and potentially shaking you out due to your eagerness. However, if you wait an hour or more to avoid that early volatility, you risk buying too extended or not at all. The stock continues going up well beyond its [buy zone](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) and you find your risk percentage too high for comfort.


Scaling into your trade with a half position acts as a suitable compromise. You get the early exposure and can follow up if the strength continues. The early buy gives you a lower average cost if the trade goes up and the reduced position puts less at risk if the trade goes against you.


A real-time trade in **Direxion Financial Bull 3X** ([FAS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FAS)) on IBD's [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) illustrates the point. On Jan. 4, as multiple financial stocks were setting up, FAS [broke out](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/how-to-buy/when-to-buy/) of a [four-weeks-tight](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/smart-chart-reading-why-short-stroke-3-weeks-tight-give-a-profit-opportunity/) pattern **(1)**. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) was leading the market, the price action showed a strong gap up, and early volume was confirming the move. We started with a half position early in the trading session at 71.29 **(1)**. FAS drifted lower the next couple of days but stayed above the entry day low. The half position made patience with the lagging position easier since it put less pressure on the portfolio.


On Jan. 9, FAS finally started moving again and the remaining position came on at 72.23 **(2)**. That was a higher price from the ideal buy zone, but the average price of 71.76 was still in range. Additionally, the stock already had over a half-percent profit cushion above its average price when the second purchase completed the position.


The first [profit goal](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/taking-stock-profits-on-the-way-up-to-compound-gains/) of 5% used the average entry price in its calculation. A strong gap up on Jan. 16 led to taking a profit on half the position at 76.22 **(3)**, more than 6% above the average entry price. FAS retreated the next few days, but having the profits booked on half the position eased some pressure for action. The half position offers flexibility on buys and sells, which sets you up for more successful trading.

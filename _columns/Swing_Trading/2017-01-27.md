Even the most successful stock traders can get it wrong — and a lot more often than you would think. It's not a great selling point for the activity but it shouldn't be a deterrent either. The simple fact is that by managing your risk, you can still make a fortune with a far from perfect record. A key to survival in [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) is not allowing a big hit to your overall portfolio from any one trade. Prudent position sizing is one way to ensure that goal.


Position size reflects your commitment to the trade. If you keep the risk to your portfolio constant, say a 0.5% risk from any one trade, then the two levers you have at your disposal are how much risk you are taking on the individual trade and the size of the trade. By committing less money when risk is higher you can avoid taking big hits to your portfolio.  Conversely, a lower risk percentage allows you to take a larger position size and still keep your portfolio risk manageable.


Consider **MarketAxess** ([MKTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MKTX)) from May last year. The stock fell below its 50-day moving average and then [reversed](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/buying-early-but-buying-smart-with-stock-reversals/) strongly on May 5, closing back above the 50-day line **(1)**. It was an "outside" day, meaning the high exceeded the previous day's high and the low was lower than the previous day's low, a bullish sign coupled with a strong reversal at an area of support. The buy zone was set at 123.44, a penny above the previous day's high. The entry on [IBD's Swing Trader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) was at 124.40.


Using an undercut of the reversal-day low (117.59) as a stop loss would have given a 5.5% risk from our entry, larger than our target of 2% to 3% for a trade, but still possible. If you wanted to risk no more than 0.5% of your portfolio on the trade, you would be looking at a position size just around 9% of your portfolio. Alternatively, you could use a tighter stop. The previous day's low as a stop loss would result in a 4.2% risk percentage, allowing you to stretch your position size closer to 12%.  The SwingTrader product comes with a [position size calculator](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/position-size-can-help-balance-risk-and-reward/) to help you with the math.


A word of caution: Be careful not to underestimate your risk. Saying that you are only risking a certain amount on a trade should factor in some worse-case scenarios. Gaps down, or even economic news intraday, can move stocks quickly. That's how even some of the best traders "blow up" their accounts. Too large a commitment with a loss going beyond expectations can decimate your portfolio. Also, making your stops too tight in order to get a larger position could result in getting shaken out of good trades.


So, how did MarketAxess turn out? When it was up 5%, half profits were booked **(2)**, and the remaining shares were sold at the 10% profit goal **(3)**. The total return was 7.5% in under three weeks. The stock has been traded three times on SwingTrader and closed profitably each time.

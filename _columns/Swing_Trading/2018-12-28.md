One of the best ways to get better as a trader is to do a post-analysis of your trading each year. The goal is to fix mistakes and repeat successes to make the most out of your following years. Here's a brief [swing trading](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/swing-trading/) analysis of 2018.




Swing Trading Analysis Of Early Months
--------------------------------------


The year started out strong as the Nasdaq composite raced up 7.4% in January **(1)** . That month IBD's SwingTrader had a 67% [win rate](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-batting-average-tells-you-about-the-market/). Even better, the average winner was more than five times larger than the average loser. It's hard not to feel invincible at that point. Keep your emotions in check and don't let greed take over. [Selling into the strength](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/selling-stocks-swing-trade-akamai-technologies/) is usually the right call in those cases. By the end of January, we were down to just one stock, **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) and [that exited on Feb. 1](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stay-for-stock-gains-avoid-market-corrections-with-swing-trades/).


With no new setups replacing the jettisoned stocks, we [sat out most of the February correction](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/what-a-week-of-bearish-reversals-means-for-swing-trades/) **(2)**. The Feb. 14 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/market-timing/market-bottoms/) signaled it was time to buy so we took advantage of a short rally. Again, selling into strength proved to be a useful strategy. As the Nasdaq composite reached new highs **(3)**, SwingTrader went to zero stocks on March 12. The low exposure [provided protection during the March correction](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/swing-trading-strategy-avoided-stock-market-correction/) **(4)**.


It's not enough to look at where you went right in your swing trading analysis. Where did you falter? That also provides instructive feedback.


The summer months proved to be challenging for swing trading. A pattern emerged of pullbacks to the 10-week line following two weeks of gains **(5)**. Holding winners through the pullbacks was easier than swing trading in that environment. IBD's [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/) product had its best month of the year in August while the batting average turned negative for SwingTrader. Why? Leaderboard had a retail concentration in names like **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)), **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)), **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) and **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). More importantly, there was cushion on the positions to hold through the minor pullbacks and some profits were already booked in the positions thanks to a [new alert system for the product](https://www.investors.com/research/how-to-find-the-best-stocks-to-buy/new-alerts-for-leaderboard-help-investors-fine-tune-holdings/).


Swing trading, by contrast, was difficult. Without cushion, we took many small losses on shakeouts during the pullbacks. Sometimes having the [flexibility of maneuvering between different styles](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/sell-alibaba-stock-swing-trading-position-trading/) can help you profit more.


Swing Trading Analysis Of Recent Correction
-------------------------------------------


Swing trading improved in September. The win rate was back above 50% and the average gain for winners doubled the losses of the average loser. Staying true to our rules and prior swing trading analysis, [selling into strength got us out early before market started correcting](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-bearish-market-outlook/) in October **(6)**. A follow-through day on Nov. 7 saw limited buying **(7)**, just a couple of quick profits. Another follow-through day on Nov. 28 had mixed results **(8)** but still [exposure remained limited](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-corrections-swing-trading-strategies/). In both cases, warning signs of a rally failure came early. In our swing trading analysis, our holding time was less than three days for the few stocks on our current trades list. Protecting capital was the priority. We were also less inclined to charge in heavy as there was [historical precedent](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-direction-look-to-past/) for a high-failure probability for the first two follow-through days.


As the correction deepened **(9)** and hit bear market territory this past week, we were sitting on zero exposure for weeks. We considered shorting, but the increased volatility made that an unappealing proposition that could easily backfire. In hindsight, it would have worked out but the calculus at the time suggested a larger risk for small reward potential.


More recently, we've tested the waters of the [Santa Claus rally](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-up-1000-points-nasdaq-goodbye-bear-market/) with [half positions](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/twilio-stock-cut-your-losses/). There's no need to press heavily until the market provides evidence it is ready to turn. A follow-through day is a good start but having merchandise to choose from is just as an important. [Bullish reversals](https://www.investors.com/research/swing-trading/stock-market-reversal-day-market-trend/) are great opportunities for swing trades but our strength-focused strategy looks at stocks in uptrends. Most reversals now feature stocks below their long-term 200-day moving averages. Our expectation is that 2019 will provide fresh ideas for profitable swing trades. Our course of action, as always, is to follow our rules.

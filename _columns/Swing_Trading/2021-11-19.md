The Russell 2000 lagged the other major indexes for the majority of this year. But that didn't stop it from creating a swing trading opportunity in November.




False Starts In The Russell 2000
--------------------------------


After topping in March, the Russell 2000 ([0RUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=0RUS)) had multiple attempts to reach new highs that quickly fizzled. Just when it looked like it was getting going, the Russell 2000 would fall back. But it never fell that much either. The pullbacks were never much more than 10% off their highs.



Recent action was like a microcosm of the year. A false start in September **(1)** quickly failed. Another start at the beginning of October fizzled **(2).**


A strong gap upÂ on the Oct. 14 [follow-through day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-follow-through-day/) **(3)** looked like it was getting traction but filled the gap less than two weeks later **(4)**.


One positive, however, was in each failed attempt the Russell 2000 came down less and less. It was as if the index was coiling like a spring.


Is This Time Different?
-----------------------


On Nov. 1, we put the ProShares Ultra Russell 2000 ETF ([UWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UWM)) on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) **(5)**. We wanted to increase market exposure and this ETF provides twice the daily movement of the Russell 2000 index using leverage. The relative strength line showed confirming action of a potential character change in the index. It also gave us exposure outside of the typical high-tech growth. The top three sectors by weight in the Russell 2000 are health care, financials and industrials.

Even with the leveraged position on the Russell 2000, we still took our first third of the position off quickly when we reached 3% profit **(6)**. And just a couple of days later we took another third off when we had a 9% gain from our entry **(7)**.


Exiting At A Turning Point
--------------------------


After a strong move that kept above the 5-day moving average line, our Russell 2000 proxy decisively broke below the line **(8)**. We took the remaining profit to protect the 6% gain that we had left after being up as much as 10%.


The next few days remained inside the bad break, but then the selling continued as the Russell 2000 undercut the low of our exit day **(9)**. It was also a significant divergence since the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were just about to break to new-high territory and actually started looking extended.


We also took some cues in our overall outlook based on the action in the Russell 2000. Since it sat out the rebound and we saw breadth narrowing, it was another reason why we didn't get overly aggressive in our exposure during the latest bounce in the Nasdaq. But that can change quickly. We're continuing to look for potential sector rotation into other areas as leaders extend their gains.

Here we go again? In some ways Monday's bid in the **CBOE Volatility Index** might look like last Wednesday's panic wherein the sentiment gauge narrowly eclipsed its early April highs. That action you may recall was partly responsible for a fairly strong, reversal set up in the broader market, which we discussed on Thursday. That said, with today's finishing tally of 9.40% to 21.76%, should we see this as a sort of second opportunity and another market dip producing a rip or umm, opening price gap higher?

  

Our coined VIX Stretch formula would suggest today's closing highs just in excess of the watched 15% or greater threshold are sufficient. As a mean-reverting instrument, this type of widened relationship is prone to snapping back towards the short-term average in order to normalize conditions on a relative basis. Nonetheless, we don't see Monday's overall VIX evidence nearly as enticing as it was for last week's bulls looking to buy the dip.

  

If and as the saying goes, rules were made to be broken, in our mind this is one of those instances where it pays to take a step back and refrain from bargain-hunting instead of blindly following one signal with too much vigor. For one, seasonally bearish technicals courtesy of the "Worst Six" calendar period following a very generous "Best Six", might be enough evidence to refrain from a second long delta play, sans a bullish follow-through day.

  

Additionally, using the VIX as a trading tool is secondary to price action in the broader market. In conjunction with Monday's closing breakdown in the S&P 500 to fresh lows and below double bottom pattern support; that bearish-looking threat trumps short-term panic; which by the looks of historical VIX price charts, still has a ways to go before being an attractive longer-term proposition.

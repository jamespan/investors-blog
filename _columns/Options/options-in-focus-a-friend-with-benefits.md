If you've heard the expression of having a friend with benefits, you'll know that shacking up an existing long stock position with a long put can offer similar rewards that can't be obtained through a standard marriage. Not that we'd recommend the double entendre, but for bulls who've already risked an unprotected affair with the likes of a breakout; legging into a long put can be extremely attractive. 

  

To illustrate where this type of legged play could be applicable, we can look to a recent breakout in IBD 50 constituent **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)). Back in early February SWI powered its way to a cup-shaped breakout Friday then proceeded to move about 4% through its ideal buy point of 33.78 to just above the 35 level.

  

  

As the technically pleasant action occurred with the market in a confirmed uptrend, bulls could be content to use a traditional stop for risk management, but with earnings on tap the next week, the option for some cheap protection seems all the more approachable. That said, to remove virtually all of the breakout risk taken, a bull who purchased shares near the buy point could "buy to open" SWI February 35 puts for $1.30 with shares at 35.07. 

  

The illustration above shows the risk graph associated with this leggy, friends with benefits play; using 300 shares purchased at $33.80 and the cost of the put. The combination eliminates all but $0.10 worth of risk for two weeks and allows the trader to carry shares through the earnings event with much greater confidence in knowing they've truly cut any potential losses short. 

  

The downside to this purchase is the trader is still forfeiting $1.30 of upside if shares proceed to rally further. There's also the consideration if shares happen, however unlikely, to just sit near the 35 level. In that type situation the put premium will also have consumed all of the trader's paper gains by expiration. That all said, risk is in the eyes of the beholder. And personally, we see very little downside with this type of quickie marriage.

IBD 50 constituent and consumer accessory fashionista **Fossil**  ([FOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOSL)) reports its earnings tomorrow morning. Ahead of the release, nervous and defensive action could be seen in the stock's technically disruptive follow-through below its 50-day simple moving average. The decline signaled FOSL's first strong break below the key price line since busting above it in early January when shares were approximately 32% lower. 

  

Nervous and defensive posturing could also be found in Fossil's options. Puts outpaced call activity by a strong 2.37-to-1.0 margin. Combined with implieds spiking to year-to-date highs into the mid-80s for ATMs in the front month May contract and where most of Monday's trader interest lay; we can deduce order flow was driven by defensive long put positioning. 

  

Most active on the session, opening paper looked to pile into the slightly out-of-the-money May 120 put and well-out-of-the-money 105 put. Fairly equal volume of 3,300 and 3,900 respectively versus similar open interest of 800 â€” 900 suggests some of today's bears may have been playing the vertical spread as a way to position. For that, we can't blame them entirely. 

  

Over the past year, immediate close-to-close post-earnings reactions in the stock have produced results of: +12.73%, -12.50%, -2.46% and +14.66%. With shares near 125.50, the 105 strike put is still 16% out of the money with nine trading days remaining on the calendar. That's more than any of the recent earnings reactions, not to mention the premium of slightly more than 1% of the current stock price. 

  

What's more, while large moves do appear the norm, consistency with FOSL's back and forth moves from quarter-to-quarter certainly isn't. Further, with ATM implieds estimating an expected move of about 14% through expiration next Friday, it appears that accessorizing one's bearish bet with a short contract, as with this particular vertical; is more than just a fashion statement; it's probably good sense and cents as well.

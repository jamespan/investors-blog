With the market now determined "in correction" mode per IBD's shift in Wednesday night's Big Picture, what's a trader to do? There is of course, rules set forth by those established investors, regarding proper portfolio management. But if traders want to truly define their profits and losses in the market, that controlling of risk might want to include options. 

  

Married puts and collars are two spread strategies involving long-stock holdings that allow traders to contain their downside exposure or maintain profitability to a guaranteed amount through the use of a protective put purchase. Another means to protect and serve one's portfolio, if individual options aren't available or simply look too illiquid to do a proper job of policing, is reaching out to the broader market for assistance. 

  

By beta weighting a portfolio's holdings, a trader can come up with a dollar-based risk value, and then proceed to buy puts and maybe even sell calls in a broad-based and extremely liquid market such as the **S&P 500 ETF**  ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) to offset the directional risk. "Beta what?" Beta is simply a measure of how a stock moves in relation to the broader market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock in question has a history of tracking the market in percent terms, both up and down.

  

One name perfectly in-tune right now with the zigs and zags of the S&P 500 is a little company called **Apple**  ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). "Little" of course is in gest. Further, our personal view is Apple's current beta underestimates the stock's technical extension and one prone to potentially aligning itself with a larger-than-market percentage loss, when the peeling process, actually begins. For those wanting to know a stock's beta, that information can be found on Yahoo! Finance under a stock's "Key Statistics" page. 

  

While hedging with a broad-based index is a bit more complicated and the strategy doesn't guard against company-specific risks, it is an alternative to simply having a stop-loss in mind and no guarantees of getting filled near one's ideal exit point. Fortunately, for bulls that have enjoyed some of Apple's near-surreal first quarter price; a company-specific AAPL April or May dated put strategy is not only available, super-liquid listed calls and puts make those contracts the obvious varietals of choice for cautious bulls tuned in to the market.

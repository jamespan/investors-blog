With shares of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) continuing its fast forward decline for a fourth straight session and well on its way towards that less touchy feely 70% benchmark from highs, is it time for value traders to begin searching for options to play the scary technical picture? 

  

If we perform the simple math of what's 30% of NFLX's July highs of nearly 305, a 70% decline amounts to a share price in the neighborhood of 90. At a price of 130, that value benchmark of sorts isn't quite there for stock traders. However, option traders wishing to play a targeted purchase like that can consider doing a cash-secured put sale. 

  

A cash-secured put sale as part of a targeted purchase position aims to collect income by selling out of the money puts while accepting or should I say, inviting the risk of assignment. I say "inviting" because while the position doesn't have to worry about margin calls, the fact is receiving assignment without protection other than being able to handle the assignment, can be tricky business. The fact is market conditions and trader opinions invariably change and sometimes dramatically at that. 

  

At the end of the day or maybe at the end of 31 days if we're looking at October expiration, who knows, if shares of NFLX get to 90 maybe NFLX will represent a has-been situation rather than a stock sporting value. That said, if you wish to be a value trader via a targeted purchase program, selling a put spread in conjunction with having enough capital to handle a potential assignmentâ€”makes better sense. Ultimately, a targeted purchase with an out-of-the money vertical takes in less premium, but with its built-in, guaranteed stop loss of sorts courtesy of the purchased further out of the money put, it makes more sense if not "cents" in our view.

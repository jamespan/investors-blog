**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) was added to the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) last week, and the stock is showing multiple green check marks in its [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-broadcom-avgo.aspx).




Broadcom stock looks very strong technically, sitting above the 21-, 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Implied volatility is toward the lower end of the 12-month range, so it's better to look at debit spreads rather than credit spreads.


Today we're looking at a bull call spread on Broadcom stock.


A bull call spread is a bullish debit spread that is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade, but also limits the upside.


Going out to the July expiration, a 630-strike call option was trading around $32.35 on Friday, and the 640 call was around $27.20.


Maximum Profit $485
-------------------


Buying the 630 call and selling the 640 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $515 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). The maximum potential profit would be $485 (the difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).



A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy, so if Broadcom stock closes below 630 on July 21, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $515 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 640. So no matter how high Broadcom stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $485.


The break-even price for the trade is equal to the long call strike plus the premium, which in this case would equal 635.15.


Managing The Broadcom Option Trade
----------------------------------


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 610, I would consider closing early for a loss.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), AVGO stock is ranked number 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 96 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 88.


The [earnings trade](https://www.investors.com/research/options/trade-desk-stock-today-this-iron-condor-may-generate-a-125-dollar-profit-by-may-12/) on The Trade Desk ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) explained May 10 worked well for those who took part. A bull put spread trade on **Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) [we discussed April 17](https://www.investors.com/research/options/wing-stock-offers-potential-45-return-in-one-month-for-bullish-option-traders/) has also done well and can be closed early.

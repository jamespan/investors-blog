Nio stock was in the news Tuesday after [announcing a partnership](https://www.investors.com/news/ford-stock-nio-partnership-chinese-auto-giant-geely-eyes-ev-deal/) with **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)).




**Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) has been floundering a bit lately after pulling back more than 50% off its high. However, bullish traders interested in some upside exposure can do so via an option trade called a risk reversal.


Risk reversals are bullish trades that involve selling an out-of-the-money put and using the proceeds to purchase an out-of-the-money call.


Nio Stock: Risk Reversal Trade
------------------------------


Let's take a look at how a risk reversal trade might look on NIO stock.


Going out to the September 2021 expiration gives the trade plenty of time to work. The September 35 strike put can be sold for around $4.60 per contract.


Those proceeds can then be used to purchase a September 45 strike call option which was trading around $4.40 per contract yesterday.



As the sold put is slightly higher priced than the bought call, the trader receives a credit into their account of $0.20 per contract or $20 in total.


However, don't think this is the most the trade can lose. The 35 put has a total loss potential of $3,500, which would occur if NIO stock went to zero.


The trade will initially perform similar to a long stock position and will profit as the stock rises, and suffer losses if the stock falls.


Delta Of 77
-----------


The risk reversal has a delta of 77 which means the combined position is roughly equivalent to owning 77 shares of NIO stock.

At expiration, if NIO stock is between 35 and 45 both options expire worthless, and the trader makes a small $20 in profit. Larger profits at expiration will occur above a price of 45 and the higher the stock goes the better for this trade. There is no limit to the profit potential.


Counting against the stock from a bullish perspective is the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of just 60 and an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 50.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Many longer-term traders that use options directionally enjoy the collar strategy. The long-stock position combines an equivalent ratio of long at or out-of-the money puts for protection and a similar amount of short calls one or more strikes above the put for financing purposes.

  

The design of the collar limits the upside potential, but the use of adjustments during a favorable run higher can allow the trader to increase his or her maximum return. It can also vastly improve upon the position's limited downside risk. Further, many investors will use the collar to accumulate shares after a corrective move by re-working the strategy around current prices in the event shares of a determined long-term holding, move into a perceived value situation.

  

Also and maybe not completely obvious, there is more than one way to initiate this flexible strategy. One method is to use a risk equivalent bull-put spread positioned at or out of the money. In using the bull put spread as an entry into the collar the trader opens up the possibility of acquiring long stock if assigned on the higher strike short put. If that doesn't sound like good news, it's actually in keeping with the actions of many traders that use the collar to accumulate stock below its current share price. 

  

Much like with a collar position that sees shares drop after being established, if the outlook of the bull put spread strategist grows less convinced buying shares on weakness is appropriate or a good idea, there's nothing to stop the trader from simply exiting the position. While the trader could be facing some portion of his or her limited loss potential, there could be a profit as well. Despite the trader's more bearish opinion, if shares aren't too far below the upper-sold strike of the vertical, the spread may have allowed for time decay to provide profits in the interim.

  

Ultimately, the vertical can be closed in its entirety prior to an assignment or even after the fact. Further and regardless of changed technical forecasts, the trader can rest more comfortably knowing the max risk at stake is the same dollar amount accepted initially when having the full faith and confidence of a bull seemed like a good idea.

It's far from the headline fascination promoted by the likes of "One Trader Does Such and Such!" Nonetheless, it appears one position of possible interest to some traders today in **Juniper Networks**  ([JNPR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNPR)) was the March / February 35 put calendar. However, in this case traders appear to be acting outside the box and taking the road less well traveled. 

  

Both 35 strikes were well traded intraday in fairly even volume and on too many smaller sized prints to try and realistically figure out who was doing what to whom. Nonetheless, with implieds under slight pressure on the day but still bid and prone to a modest volatility crush, I suspect some of today's paper was concentrating their efforts on placing short at-the-money calendars. 

  

Unlike or opposite the well-chatted long calendar, the trader placing a short at-the-money calendar or time spread is long Gamma and short Vega. In taking in an initial credit, the trader is looking to buy back the position for less money. With the fore-mentioned Greeks in mind, either a dramatic move up or down and away from the strike and / or a decline in implieds, which favors the short back month more than what's lost in the front, is what's required for the strategy to pay off.

  

  

Seeing how shares of JNPR have consolidated at lower levels just below its 50-day simple moving average following a bearish sympathy reaction tied to **F5 Network's** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) below-views fallout from last week and JNPR's 200-day simple moving average at much lower levels; I personally see the potential for a strong move to occur and why traders might be putting on a short put calendar. 

  

Much like the long calendar, which receives more favor due to its long back month contract that enables much lesser margin requirements outside of professional accounts; the short calendar is still limited risk in its construction. With this position though, the trader does need to take some type of closing action or adjustment prior to expiration or otherwise face the possibility of being naked short contracts.

  

Also, the short calendar does face a small, increased chance of larger-than-expected losses due to its short Vega component. That can occur for instance if news such as a F.D.A. trial is announced which impacts the back month but not the front month contract. Seeing how that's not an option at Juniper, I can't blame traders for trying with JNPR's short calendar. *"What do you think? Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.*

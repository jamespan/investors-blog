After today's move of about 6% in shares of discount retailer **Ross Stores**  ([ROST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROST)), the last known base treasured by growth enthusiasts lay about 21% below with a proper buy point of 41.59 out of slightly ill-formed five month cup with handle back in early October. 

  

A few bulls willing to pay up for merchandise might say late November's three-week pullback into 50-day simple moving average support fits the bill of sale of sorts with its short base breakout now about 6% below the current share price. 

  

While neither signal enjoyed the benefit of the market supporting fresh purchases, bulls that did manage to pick up some stock merchandise off the discount rack should consider buying protection. Both favorable movement in the underlying and mostly cheap option pricing are combining to afford an attractive situation for bulls. 

  

With a held long stock position and gains like the fore-mentioned on paper but not yet in hand, a trader could simply purchase a long put for every 100 shares of stock owned to form a married put or synthetic long call. Typically, the put bought is positioned below current levels or out-of-the money. But for those wishing to lock in more secure gains, traders can look to an "at" or even an in-the-money put. 

  

Buying a deeper put with intrinsic value means one is guaranteeing an offsetting stock sale at a higher stock price than with the out-of-the money put. The downside to this added protection is actually to the upside in shares. Don't get me wrong, continued profits are still very possible. At the end of the day, all married puts regardless of strike position maintain unlimited (in theory) or the more correctly used, open-ended upside potential if shares become even more fashionable in the days and weeks ahead. 

  

There is a cost though. A deeper put maintains a larger negative delta relative to the positive delta of the underlying stock. Thus the net result is a smaller overall positive delta upon initiation when using the likes of an in-the-money put. Eventually and given a strong enough bullish move in shares, the put's delta can drop towards zero and the trader will have a position that behaves virtually like stock once again. 

  

The downside to this, or what needs to be re-evaluated, is the protective value of the purchased put. At that point, the former in-the-money put would well out-of-the money and too far removed from the new and improved, higher price in the shares. And without another adjustment, such as a roll into a higher put, the prior protection wouldn't be of much use to our shareholder other than knowing they have an absolute emergency exit during a fire sale.

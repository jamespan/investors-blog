No.3 ranked IBD 50 constituent and yoga-centric apparel outfit **Lululemon Athletica**  ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) disappointed a few bulls this morning with its mostly in-line earnings outlook and "slightly underwhelming revenue" forecast according to Investors.com. 

  

The show of concern in shares resulted in the stock being underwater by about 5% with just more than an hour to go in Thursday's session. The good news or more optimistic spin is that's not a whole lot of disappointment if one figures in LULU's gain of nearly 1,500% from its March 2009 low of sub $5 a share. 

  

Also supportive, while volatile today, shares of LULU did manage to maintain its 50-day simple moving average which more or less coincides with its prior base highs. The stock also kept recent lows of 72.69, which fell just below the influential moving average, intact. 

  

The price action doesn't appear to have been lost on some option bulls judging by an eye-balled appreciation for what I like to call "crowd proxy" activity. Without checking for prints, which I'd expect to be a futile task during such conditions, we can see the evidence of a slightly bullish positioned 1 x 2 x 1 having seen action today in the April 75, 80 and 85 calls on volume of about 950, 1,900 and 830. 

  

  

The ratio of activity, if we're bold enough to see the middle strike as having been sold, would represent a long butterfly. Shown above is an illustrated 5 x -10 x 5 position. This one is priced for $355 mid market or $0.71 per spread, but given LULU's liquidity would realistically require $0.80 to $0.85 in order to enjoy a near 30-Day Trial Offer to work out as a softer delta bull. Given today's report, supportive but maybe tired-looking price action and a market already working out a kink or two of its own; the butterfly sounds about right to this option strategist.

Even the big money and those posited as maintaining the inside edge on information get it wrong from time to time and possibly more often than we're led to believe. A large non-directional premium seller in **Gilead Sciences**  ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) appears to be the latest casualty of this type of inevitable circumstance. 

  

In Wednesday's session, a trader was spied putting up nearly 3,000, now former, at-the-money May 46 straddles for $5.08. According to data mining and analysis from Schaeffer's Research, the action was initiated by an opening seller and one obviously looking for continued lateral base-building and a decline in implied volatility over the next handful of weeks into expiration, if not sooner. 

  

It turns out the timing couldn't have been worse, as the decision to place the trade was obviously aware of pending news involving Gilead's GS-7977 hepatitis C drug. Bullish data regarding the treatment was released at a multi-day European conference and whose potential for a catalyst was most certainly not lost on other option traders' busy bidding up implieds in front of the event. 

  

Intraday, premiums came in abruptly in what's referred to as a volatility crush. Pricing of the former at-the-money straddle compared to today's new-at-the money went from the mid-to-high 40s into the low 30s. However, with shares up 12.3% near $52.30, the straddle which now looks a bit more like a deep call in its behavior is fetching $7.10 or about $2.00 more than yesterday's sale price. 

  

Things could be worse. And in fact, they were in the opening minutes of trade. That is when the intrinsic value of the spread was $8.75 as a bearish technical eyesore got filled, but one which ultimately held bulls at bay. Now with 28 days until expiration and no overt signs the trader exited just yet, all the trader needs is for shares of GILD to show a bit of conventional Wall Street wisdom that all gaps, including today's, get filled and to go along with a more trying volatility crush thus far.

When looking for bearish option trade candidates, **FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) is one stock that might fit the bill. Despite rallying this month, FedEx stock is hitting resistance at the declining [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/). 




Traders who think the downtrend might resume could look at a bearish calendar trade. A bearish calendar is negative delta (ratio comparing price of asset vs. price of option) and positive vega (sensitivity to implied volatility), so can do quite well when the stock drops. 


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price. 


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they would use puts. 


Let's take a look at an example of a bearish calendar spread on FDX stock. 


With FedEx stock trading around 235, let's assume the trader thinks it might drop down to 210. 


The trader could sell the Dec. 17-expiring, 210-strike put for around $2.75, then buy the Jan. 21, 210-strike put for around $4.25. 


That results in a net cost for the trade of $150 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.


Estimated Profit Of $650 On FedEx Stock
---------------------------------------


The estimated maximum profit is $650, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility. 



The idea with the trade is that if FedEx stock trades down around 210 in the next few weeks, the calendar spread will increase in value, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit. 


Implied volatility for FDX is currently sitting around 23%, which is around the lowest level seen in the last 12 months. 


When implied volatility is low, it can be good to look at positive vega strategies such as calendar spreads. 


FedEx stock currently has low IBD ratings. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 41, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 58 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 15, which is another reason it might make a bearish trade candidate. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

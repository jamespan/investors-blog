Miners had a strong day yesterday and **Rio Tinto** ([RIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIO)) joined [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) as a quick way to profit. Here's another way. A bull call spread on RIO stock has a favorable risk/reward if you think it can hit 82 between now and mid-March.




Bull Call Spread On RIO Stock
-----------------------------


RIO stock is ranked No. 3 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 86.   

Unlike many stocks out there right now, RIO stock is sitting above its 21-, 50- and 200-day moving average lines.



This is a company based in the United Kingdom and trades in U.S. markets as an American depositary receipt. That's why the chart might look like it has a lot of gaps in price. It's adjusting to the overnight trading at the market open in the U.S.


With the growing strength in miners, you could participate in a bullish move in RIO stock with less capital at risk using a bull call spread.


A bull call spread setup requires you buy a call and then sell a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


A bull call spread is a defined risk trade, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


RIO stock closed at 76.64 yesterday. Going out to the March monthly expiration, an 80-strike call option was trading around $1.70 yesterday, and the 82.50 call was around $1.15.


Buying the 80 call and selling the 82.50 call on RIO stock creates a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $55 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). The maximum potential profit is $195 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


Maximum Trade Risk
------------------


Since a bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy, if RIO stock closes below 80 on Mar. 18, the most the trade loses is the roughly $55 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 82.50. No matter how high RIO stock goes, the most the trade profits is $195.


In terms of trade management, if RIO stock dropped below 72, I would consider closing early for a loss.


RIO earnings are set for late February, so there is earnings risk with this trade unless it's closed before then.


More aggressive traders may prefer just to buy the 80-strike call. You'll pay a higher premium but a long-call trade doesn't limit the upside potential. The premium paid is still the most you could lose on the long-call trade in RIO stock.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

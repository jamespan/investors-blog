A put ratio spread is an advanced option trade that can have its place within an option portfolio — even in a blue chip such as **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)). Boeing stock is showing bullish action so far in 2023 and has set up a [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-patterns-flat-base-dull-trade-positive-action/?) that offers a 221.43 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-best-stocks-have-crystal-clear-buy-points-heres-how-to-identify-them/).




Option veterans generally consider the put ratio spread a neutral strategy. Yet it has the ability to make a profit in up, down and sideways markets. The key lies in the timing!


The strategy involves buying a put option and selling two put options further out-of-the-money.


The trade is placed when the trader thinks the underlying stock will be stable or slowly move lower and finish around the short put strike at expiry.


A fall in implied volatility will benefit this trade in Boeing stock. It can also generate a profit if the stock moves up early in the trade. The main risk with the trade? A sharp move lower early in the trade.


**Boeing Stock Today: Setting Up A Put Ratio Spread**
-----------------------------------------------------



On Boeing stock, we could buy the May 19-expiring put option with a strike price of 200 for around $5. Then, we could sell two of the May 19 190-strike puts for around $2.95. As we are selling two contracts at $2.95 for a total premium of $5.90 received, the trade results in a net credit of $0.90 per contract.


Initially, this marks the maximum gain above the Boeing stock price of 200. Basically, all the puts would expire worthless, and the trader keeps the $90 premium.


A tent-shaped profit zone exists between 180 and 200; the maximum gain triggers at 190 for around $1,100.


This strategy should move fairly slowly unless there is a sharp drop in the stock price. The trade starts with a delta of 7, which means it is roughly equivalent to owning 7 shares of BA stock. This will change as the trade progresses.


As the trade involves naked options, it is not recommended for beginners.

**Where To Set A Stop**


In terms of a stop loss, I would close the trade if it was down $300.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Boeing stock ranks No. 18 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 78, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 25 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) reports earnings next Wednesday after the closing bell. That makes it a candidate for an iron condor strategy if you think CRM stock will stay within its expected range.




Iron Condor Strategy
--------------------


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction. You receive a premium upfront for the two credit spreads and as long as the stock behaves, the premium value declines. That let's you close the position early by covering at a lower price or, in the best case, having the options expire worthless.


Last week's [iron condor example on **Home Depot** (](https://www.investors.com/research/options/this-option-trade-profits-from-an-expected-earnings-reaction-in-home-depot-stock/)[HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) had a gain of about 5% at the close yesterday. Maybe CRM stock can provide another winning iron condor trade?


CRM Stock Setup For Iron Condor
-------------------------------


In its recent history, Salesforce stock tended to stay within its expected range following earnings. Traders that believe CRM stock will not move too much following this upcoming earnings report, might look at the iron condor to profit.


Here's how to set it up:


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Aug. 26 expiry, sell the 170 put and buy the 165 put. That spread traded around 60 cents yesterday. The 50-day moving average line for CRM stock is around 177 so the 170 strike gives it plenty of room to wiggle below that line.


Then the bear call spread. A trader might sell the 207.50 call and buy the 212.50 call on CRM stock. That traded around 50 cents yesterday. The 200-day line is at 210 and still 11% away so the stock has room to move up near that point. We use the same expiration date for both spreads and the difference between the strike prices is also the same.



In total, this iron condor on Salesforce stock generates around $1.10 per contract or $110 of premium.


Profit And Loss Ranges
----------------------


The profit zone ranges between 168.90 and 208.60. This can be calculated by taking the short strikes of 170 and 207.50, then adding or subtracting the premium received.  

As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is $390. You subtract the premium received from the width of the strikes to get that number, 5 - 1.10 x 100 = $390.


Therefore, if we take the premium ($110) divided by the maximum risk ($390), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 28% in just a over a week's time.


Iron condors work well with price stability. However, if CRM stock makes a bigger than expected move, the trade will suffer losses.


Plus, trades held over earnings allow little room for adjusting. It's a binary event so they can be a bit hit or miss.


CRM has stayed within the expected range following all six of the most recent earnings releases. Although as we know, past performance doesn't guarantee future results.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), CRM stock ranks No. 19 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 63, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 77 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 41.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

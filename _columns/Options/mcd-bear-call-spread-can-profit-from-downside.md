The market remains in a confirmed uptrend, but the distribution days are starting to stack up.




Traders with a lot of bullish exposure may want to start hedging their bets by adding some bearish option trades.


**McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) stock is one that could be a good candidate given that the stock is below declining 21-day and 50-day moving averages.


For the last month, MCD stock has been unable to cross back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) as that level has proved to be a strong resistance point.



MCD stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 25, an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of just 22 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 60 making it a good potential candidate for a bearish option trade. An easy trade for beginners is a bear call spread. A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


Bear Call Spread: Limited Risk Bearish Trade
--------------------------------------------


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiration.


On MCD stock, a February expiry bear call spread could be set up using the 220 strike as the short call and the 230 strike as the long call. I would look to sell that spread for $2.20 or more, depending on where the market trades today. The maximum profit on the trade would be $220 per contract with a maximum risk of $780.


The spread would achieve the maximum 28% profit if MCD stock closes below 220 on Feb. 19. In that case, the entire spread would expire worthless allowing the trader to keep the $220 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if MCD stock closes above 230 on Feb. 19 which would see the premium seller lose $780 on the trade.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss if the spread increased in value to $330 or if MCD stock closed above 220. MCD earnings are scheduled for Jan. 28, so there is earnings risk with this trade.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

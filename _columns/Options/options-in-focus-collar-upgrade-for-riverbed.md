Erstwhile growth upstart **Riverbed Technology** ([RVBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVBD)) took a major step backwards Friday, with shares plummeting more than 28% after the network communications outfit disappointed with its top and bottom-line miss and below-views guidance for its upcoming second quarter. 

  

Analysts by and large grabbed the opportunity to recalibrate earnings expectations lower and cut ratings with seven brokerages downgrading shares compared to just two "buy" reiterations.

  

Pacific Crest, one of Riverbed's minority defenders advised clients with an intermediate-term horizon to "aggressively buy" RVBD shares below $25 based on the prospects for improving growth and margins in the June quarter with downside risk to $21 based on 14x 2013 EPS estimates plus cash and upside potential to $34 a share. 

  

Late in Friday's session and shares of RVBD just below $20, we can only imagine how excited Pacific Crest's clients, that maybe began buying shares in earnest at $23 when analysts first noted the sell-off as being "overdone" are with a haircut of three points or 13%, as well as a 20% discount to $25.

  

  

What I can say with a bit more confidence is with very liquid options and one-point strike distances, without having to worry too much about Friday's mighty red current in shares, a simple but potentially dynamic strategy like the 5x May 19 / 21 collar shown above looks like a much better position for bulls. I guess you could say we've given a Riverbed "buy" reiteration an upgrade with a collar that seems to make protective sense, as well as enough likely cents or dollars if RVBD begins to swim back up river.

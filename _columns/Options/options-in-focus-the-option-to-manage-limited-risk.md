On Monday's much darker and technically troubling times in the market, we discussed a bearish softer delta vertical strategy for **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)). Ahead of its earnings report with shares at the time near 95, we liked the idea of using the May 90 / 80 put spread for $3.10.

  

In conjunction with a technical stop to reduce the spread's risk even further, the strategy seemed like a nice set up for a stock consolidating in a bearish flag pattern complete with a "Death Cross" signaling that same day. 

  

"Set up or just set up?" I'm not sure, but given some of the broader market's own rather dramatic and surprising technical punches this week; limited risk bears like discussed, have little to actually complain about. True, Thursday's bullish price gap and current 7% plus gainer have resulted in our spread whittled down to a nearly worthless market value of $0.30 even though 29 calendar days remain. 

  

On the other hand and back to using our discussed managed / discretionary money management; the damage could have been easily mitigated. Despite Wednesday's strong pre-earnings jump which took out our technical exit of $97.73 by a couple points; the spread was still only down -$1.20 versus our conservatively estimated allowance of $1.50 or roughly 50% of the vertical's debit. 

  

The reason for this slight bit of pleasantness, in what still amounts to as a loss, was mostly the result of the speed at which shares moved against the position. A slight move up in implied volatility may have benefitted the long vega spread as well, but a mostly equal amount of decay, made for a push as far as the P&L is concerned. 

  

In the end, it would have been nice to have seen a similar sized move to the downside and which would have offered a nice adjustment in front of the report. However, in a mad money market like we've experienced this week, you have to take what you can get, even if that means a well-executed smaller loss. We're just glad that type option, or umm, spread exists.

**Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLF)) stock has been strong lately, putting in a nice series of higher highs and higher lows.




CLF stock is currently above the [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and 200-day moving averages and they are all sloping upward, which is a good sign.


With the stock sitting in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), it would be a good opportunity to look at two different bullish option trade ideas.


Buying Out-of-the-Money Calls
-----------------------------


Buying out-of-the-money calls is one of the most aggressive (and risky) option trades. Traders using this strategy would be extremely confident of higher prices in the short-term.


Let's look at an example:


Using the July 16-expiration calls, a trader could buy the 26-strike calls for around $1.80 each Friday, and that is the most the trade could lose.


The break-even price at expiry is equal to the strike price plus the premium paid, which in this case, is 27.80.


Profits can be achieved at lower prices if the upward move occurs sooner. For example, if Cleveland-Cliffs stock were to trade up at 26.50 today, the 26-strike calls could show a profit of around $100 for a block of 100 stocks. (The option would still have time premium.)


Buying out-of-the-money calls is a bit too risky for me because you must be spot on with both the direction *and* the timing. That is difficult to do.


Let's look at a more conservative strategy, an in-the-money bull call spread.


Bull Call Spread Example
------------------------


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Using the same July expiration, a 22-strike call option was trading around $3.50 on Friday, and the 27 call was around $1.55.


Buying the 22 call and selling the 27 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $195 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100), and the maximum profit potential would be $305 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if CLF stock closes below 22 on July 16, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $195 premium paid.


Potential Gains Capped For CLF Stock Option Play
------------------------------------------------


Potential gains are also capped above 27, so no matter how high Cleveland-Cliffs stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $305.


If CLF stock were to hit 26.50 today, this bull call spread would gain around $60.


These are two different ways to trade the stock and should give you something to think about.


Cleveland-Cliffs has a best-possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 49 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97.


It is important to remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

It's not something you see very often these days, but it can occur during fast market conditions and if the product in question is liquid and traded in penny increments. The situation I'm referring to is when buyers and sellers seemingly agree to a point where an option market looks like a Vegas line or a "pick 'em market." 

  

Entering the final hour of trade this occurred in the **ProShares UltraShort S&P 500 ETF** ([SDS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SDS)). With the index proxy at 27.95 some of the following markets were "available:"

  

August 23 Call: $4.85 B / $5.00 A | Put: $0.09 B / $0.10 A 

  

August 24 Call: $4.00 B / $4.10 A | Put: $0.24 B / $0.24 A 

  

August 25 Call: $2.69 B / $2.80 A | Put: $0.49 B / $0.53 A 

  

Do you see what I saw? The out-of-the money August 24 put showed a contract price of $0.24 which both buyers and sellers were apparently agreeable about. "Availability" of course to do anything fancy such as a spread like maybe taking the time to short the SDS at $27.95, "sell to open" the put at $0.24 and buying the same strike 24 call to lock in a reversal arbitrage for a guaranteed profit â€” well, that my friend is an entirely different matter. 

  

The reality is that for a brief, and I mean brief moment in time, a trader could have either bought or sold the contract for $0.24. However, given the over-the-top volatility I'd confidently estimate you'd have needed more than T3 connectivity into the likes of the server room at the NYSE in order to have a fighting chance to get away with some of that mad, but profitable money in a meaningful way that's guaranteed to please.

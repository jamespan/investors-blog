IShares Silver Trust ([SLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLV)) has been on fire lately. Investors who want to get in on the action with SLV stock can do so with low cost via a long call option.




A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (strike price), up until a certain date (expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage (this can be both a good and a bad thing).


Silver is one of the hot sectors of the market right now with SLV stock rising from 14.50 to 16.17 in just a few days.


Using call options is a way to ride the trend while minimizing the downside risk if you get it wrong.


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of SLV stock, they would have to invest around $1,617 at the current price.


SLV Stock: Option Trade
-----------------------


Instead, the investor could gain the same exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option.


One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.



If the investor were to buy one SLV $13 call option expiring on July 17, they would only need to invest $325 rather than $1,617. If SLV stock goes to zero, the call option loses only $325 while still maintaining a similar exposure to the gains.


The SLV $13 call option gives the investor the right to buy 100 shares of SLV stock at $13 up until the expiration date.


The call option costs around $3.25 so the investor would need SLV stock to rise above 16.25 (strike price plus premium paid) in order to be profitable on the investment.


If SLV stock rises to, say, 19, then the long call would be worth $600, almost double the cost of the position.


There is always a risk with trading on leverage like this, of course. If SLV stock drops below $13 at expiry, the investor would lose 100% of the investment, which is the entire $325.


Buying a call option is just one of numerous possible option strategies, but it is a very easy one for beginners.


SLV Stock: Advanced Strategy
----------------------------


An advanced strategy to reduce the cost of the long call would be to turn the trade into a bull call spread by also selling a 19 call option.


This caps the upside gains but also reduces the cost of the position by around $30.

It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.


However, a long call option, when done correctly, can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock or ETF with the similar upside potential to owning the underlying stock and less downside risk.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

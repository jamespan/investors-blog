**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) recently broke above the 50-day moving average and looks stronger than some of its big-cap tech counterparts. If you are bullish on Apple stock but don't want to outlay much capital, a leveraged covered-call strategy could be an option trade to consider.




The Income Of A Covered Call At A Reduced Cost
----------------------------------------------


Recall that the covered-call strategy collects option premium by selling a short-term, out-of-the-money call against a stock position. The call is "covered" by the stock that is owned if the shares are called away.


So, to buy a covered call on Apple stock requires that you first own 100 shares of the stock at a total cost of around $11,935.


Instead of owning 100 shares of Apple stock, what if you buy a long-term, deep in-the-money call? The long-term call effectively replaces the long-stock position at a fraction of the cost.


This leveraged covered-call strategy is often called a "poor man's covered call." You gain a similar return profile as a covered-call strategy but with much less capital outlay.


The Poor Man's Covered Call On Apple Stock
------------------------------------------


AAPL stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 87, an EPS Rating of 81 and an Relative Strength Rating of 89. That's pretty good compared with its large-cap brethren. And since Apple stock looks like it's making itself comfortable above the 50-day moving average, this leveraged covered call could be a nice option trade to consider.



Rather than tying up $11,935 for 100 shares of Apple stock, a similar exposure can be obtained by buying a Jan. 21, 2022, call with a strike price of 110. That call was trading yesterday for around 22.35 per share, or $2,235 for one contract. That's less than one-fifth the cost of the stock purchase.


The trader can then sell monthly calls against that position as normal.


For example, selling a Dec. 18 call with a strike price of 125 would generate $250 in premium and still provide some capital gain potential.


Exposure And Risk
-----------------


The combined option position has a delta of 32. That means the initial exposure is roughly equivalent to owning 32 shares of AAPL stock. This exposure will change as time passes and the stock price moves.


This is a bullish trade and any drop in the AAPL stock price will adversely impact the trade.


In terms of risk management, I would rethink the position if Apple stock dropped below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/), currently around 115.

Fear is in the air for a second straight session. You can almost smell or taste it, if we're to direct our attention to the likes of **Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) with shares off about 15% after hours following disappointing results or **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) 5.8% slice off shareholder value. Or if you want to take your cue from the option market, you can simply look at the price action in the CBOE Volatility Index. The market's notorious sentiment index confirmed its euphemistic moniker, the fear gauge for a second day in a row Tuesday and when all was said and done, is looking a bit more troubling than the session prior. 

  

In case you missed it, Monday saw the VIX surge intraday by about 25% after reignited credit market concerns upended bulls maybe thinking the worst was behind them. Not only was the spike in premiums the strongest in 2012, it also signaled a fearful extreme in the VIX relative to its mean-reverting 10-day simple moving average with an intraday differential of about 19%. Differentials wider than 15% are prone to investors shifting gears and reversing back towards the average as the short-term extreme looks to neutralize itself. 

  

In conjunction with a test of the closely watched 20% level and 50-day simple moving average, an intraday reversal which found the VIX finishing up a less chaotic 14.4% at 18.6%, looked promising for bulls in equities as the S&P 500 held its uptrend and 50-day simple moving average while finishing in a bullish hammer. Disappointingly, sometimes promises are broken and that unfortunately happens to be the case Tuesday. 

  

The S&P 500 broke below its reversal candle and the VIX reversed right back up to finish near Monday's highs and slightly above 20% while sporting a closing extreme overbought differential of 16.8%. But is two better than one for bulls looking to position from a contrarian vantage point? 

  

Evidence of proper moving average alignment and May's credit-related premium surge falling short of the historically over-the-top 30% reading in the VIX, might provide anecdotal evidence for bulls that today's and yesterday's fear could be tomorrow's buying opportunity. Also, there's still 50-day simple moving average and up-channel support in the S&P 500 to consider. If you do however, remember that other reason traders use the option market, namely to position with less fear in case fear comes undone in a less desirable and more out-of-control way.

There's a saying amongst option traders which states, "Sell 100 and Buy 200." The adage is basically a loose way of suggesting as implieds rise into triple-digit territory, that firstly, it generally pays to fade the fearful bid as a net seller of short contract premium. But, if prices paid for protection in a stock's calls and puts gets too elevated, i.e. through 200% IV; then all prior bets are off the table and fear might be respected as being a harbinger of even greater and more volatile price action to come.

  

Fear is generally associated with a stock that's plummeting as most investors play the market as directional bulls. On the other hand, when options premiums continue to race higher and reach above an arbitrary but typically extreme 200% IV; "fear" can be tied to a substantial move in either direction. This is viewed this way as it suggests many of the more sophisticated players making the markets which try to be neutral as to which way shares might move, are in effect, giving up on fading controlled volatility. As much and during such instances when even the most informed money is now looking panicked—you should be too.

  

**Harbin Electric**, ([HRBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRBN)) which we've discussed twice in the past several sessions and most recently on Friday seems to be good confirmation for appreciating this nugget of unconventional wisdom. For our part, we didn't have an axe to grind directionally as to what the near future, let alone today's action, might bring. Following a decent enough guesstimate of lower prices for shares on the prior Friday due to less than bullish option trading which occurred in the face of the company's buyout update; the "easy interpretation or maybe just the lucky one" was no longer available with shares down more than 50%.

  

Alternatively, we were appreciative of what the very elevated premiums in excess of 200% were saying to us. As much, we finished off our piece noting our expectation was for more outsized volatility as being in the cards. With shares vaulting higher and currently up nearly 64% to 13.50 on fresh word of a definitive agreement and plan of merger for $24 a share in cash with Tech Full Electric; I'd say that promise was fulfilled and much quicker than the still fishy-looking one hogging the headlines.

Admittedly, my chart reading skills were off the mark back on March 2 when I discussed a bearish flag confirmation in **Sina.com** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)). The write up was part of my midday commentary at Optionetics and sided with what looked like investor disappointment over good but not exactly great quarterly results and forward guidance, as well as a BofA/Merrill Lynch downgrade that day to "Neutral" from "Buy." 

  

Also stated at the time, "one man's bear flag is another's second stage base" paid tribute to a more optimistic-minded IBD analysis of SINA's sell-off. In the here and now, with shares now markedly higher and IBD having changed their market outlook to a more cautious one; maybe that second-stage base might be better appreciated as a bearish first stage pattern? Well, if you like the look of a bearish gap fill, lower high double tops complete with shooting star candles, then you may agree. 

  

For option traders, who do see things less optimistically but wish to steer clear of potentially uncontrolled losses due to open-ended risk-taking, today's fairly well and mostly equally-traded March 85 put, March 90 and 95 call gave me the idea of designing a limited risk twist on a risk reversal position with bears in mind.

  

  

As of Wednesday's close and using mid market prices (slightly generous), this softer delta bear could receive a credit of $0.73 per spread for his or her efforts by purchasing the out-of-money March 85 put while simultaneously selling the at-the-money March 90 / 95 bear vertical. 

  

With shares mostly at the 90 strike, this bear can stand ready to collect the entire credit if the stock simply sits. Even more attractive, this bear would see sizable profits if shares begin to give back a portion of some of the past weeks near 20% gainerâ€”and better yet, maintain limited risk just in case second stage base building becomes the real deal instead of the other guy's top in progress.

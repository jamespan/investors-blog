The yen is looking like a long-term winner after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential vote, following a protectionism-heavy election campaign that's roiled markets worldwide and spurred the currency toward its best year since the 2008 global financial crisis.


Options traders have become more bullish on the yen as the election nears, while hedge funds wagered since early January that the currency will gain. **JPMorgan Chase & Co.** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **HSBC Holdings PLC** ([HSBC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HSBC)) say that neither Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump will favor a stronger dollar, so any short-term fluctuations in the yen as the vote nears are likely to give way to gains for the Japanese currency over the longer term. An expected Federal Reserve rate increase also may already be priced in.


"Regardless of which candidate becomes president, U.S. policies are expected to be more protectionist and keep a cap on the dollar," said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JPMorgan in Tokyo. There is another reason for the dollar rally to wane, he said. "If the Fed does raise interest rates in December, it will likely follow the same pattern as last year where the dollar and U.S. yields rose until a rate increase and then declined."


Japan's currency slid 1.3% to 104.46 per dollar on Monday, erasing much of its gains from last week, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was sticking by its finding that Hillary Clinton didn't commit a crime in her handling of emails. It was a fresh reminder for investors of the market's volatility amid the final days of the election campaign as the euro and the Swiss franc also dropped, while Mexico's peso soared. The most accurate currency forecasters saw steeper gains in the yen should Trump win than declines in the event of a win for Clinton, in a survey by Bloomberg News.


Despite futures signaling 80% odds for a Fed interest-rate increase in December, the dollar faltered against the yen last week with its steepest slide since July. The yen fell in November 2015 before rebounding in December, when the U.S. central bank hiked borrowing costs for the first time in a decade. Its 15% surge this year is the strongest performance among Group of 10 currencies.


Currency options indicate traders are more concerned about yen gains than declines. The cost to protect against an advance in Japan's currency rose to the highest since June on Monday, relative to the cost to insure against dollar strength, one-month risk reversals show. The yen was at 104.46 per dollar as of 1:26 p.m. in Tokyo Tuesday.


Meanwhile, analysts are sticking with their forecasts. The median projection from strategists surveyed by Bloomberg has the currency rising to 103 per dollar by March 31. That level hasn't shifted since analysts last boosted their yen estimates early last month.


Wagers from leveraged funds for the yen to gain against the dollar exceeded bets on declines as of Nov. 1 by 28,114 contracts, according to the latest data available from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The net longs peaked in September at an eight-year high of 64,179 contracts.


HSBC also sees the dollar's recent rallies making the currency prone to declines.


"Both candidates favor a weak dollar, so dollar selling may gain momentum after the election," said Shuji Shirota, head of the macroeconomic strategy group at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. "The risk of the dollar falling below 100 yen will heighten toward the end of the year and into next year."


The Japanese currency's strength faces some headwinds from local bond investors, especially after its advance stalled over the past two months or so when it bounced off the 100 per dollar area, a level Deutsche Bank AG sees as key for some of Japan's biggest money managers.


That's led institutional investors, including life insurance companies, to express interest in boosting unhedged foreign bond investment in the second half of the fiscal year, meaning they would be selling yen to buy dollars when they purchase debt abroad. Deutsche Bank AG sees 100 yen as crucial for life insurers.


"Life insurers may help support the dollar/yen by boosting unhedged foreign bond purchases if views are sustained for the pair to hold above 100," said  Taisuke Tanaka, Deutsche Bank's chief currency strategist and head of fixed-income research in Tokyo. "But, if the dollar falls deep below 100 yen, they could accelerate dollar selling in order to boost hedging ratios on foreign bonds they already hold."


JPMorgan's Sasaki also regards 100 yen as a key level.


"Life insurance companies may be more proactive in unhedged foreign bond investment if they see the dollar is firming around 100 yen, and such a view may actually be a factor behind the relatively solid dollar-yen," Sasaki said. "Their stance may be one factor supporting the dollar-yen but it won't change the bigger trend."

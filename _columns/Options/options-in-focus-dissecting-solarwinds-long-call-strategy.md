IBD 50 constituent **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)), an IT management tools provider with a rather misleading moniker confirmed last week's breakout from a square-box base. In late Monday trade; shares had sizzled higher from a modest two-day pullback to fresh all-time highs on its best volume in nearly two months' time. 

  

Option traders appear to have taken notice of the bullish follow-through as well. With SWI about 3% past it proper buy point of $39.85 at $41.05, the surrounding money April 40 and 45 calls have been the day's most active by a wide margin on volume of 1,511 and 722 respectively. 

  

Slightly larger open interest figures prevent carnal knowledge of who's doing what to whom, but we suspect some rolling and a likely building of overall open interest are driving Monday's order flow. The lower strike April 40 call allows a bullish trader to acquire stock at $40. However, given that right currently costs about $2.35 per contract the trader's breakeven is the strike price plus the premium paid or $42.35. 

  

A share price of $42.35 is roughly 3.5% higher and about 1.5% beyond IBD's proper buying range within 5% of the pattern pivot. That said, a long call strategist is very likely to do better than breakeven if shares rally in that direction prior to expiration. A quicker and stronger move towards the expiration breakeven mark would, allow for the call to maintain some extrinsic or time value beyond its intrinsic or worth as purely a stock equivalent. 

  

For a double in premium and the contract to go from $2.35 to $4.70, shares are going to need to move an additional 9% by expiration. Again, the sooner and swifter the underlying obliges bulls, the more profits the long call holder will show. However, were a move in shares to $44.70 to become a reality; open profits and the contract's premium will be almost entirely built of intrinsic value. 

  

Intrinsic value isn't a bad or good thing per se, but more of a shifting variable which is definitely required at expiration if a trader long a contract is to have any chance of profitability. In relating the April 40 call to this phenomenon, gamma, the Greek responsible for changes in delta per point move in the underlying, would effectively force the current 65 delta towards 100, at which time it would act more or less like stock. In the end extrinsic premium can only take you so far and before intrinsic price action--either makes or breaks your day.

**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is showing some improvement this week, rising above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-trade-stocks-using-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).




Tesla stock is also trying to regain the 200 price level.


Today, I want to look at a strategy with a small income potential on the upside and a healthy profit zone on the downside.


The strategy is called a broken wing butterfly. We'll use puts because the strikes will all be below the stock price. This helps to reduce assignment risk.


With a regular butterfly option trade, the wings are placed an equal distance from the short strike. But with a broken wing butterfly, we leave a larger gap on a particular side.


Setting Up Tesla Broken Wing Butterfly
--------------------------------------


This results in less risk on one side and more risk on the opposite side.


Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on Tesla stock.


* Buy 1 April 19, 170 put @ 3.30
* Sell 2 April 19, 190 put @ 8.90
* Buy 1 April 19, 200 put @ 13.40


Notice that the upper strike put is 10 points away from the middle put and the lower put is 20 points away.


This broken wing butterfly trade will result in a net credit of $110. That means there is no risk if the stock remains above 200.


The worst that can happen is all the puts expire worthless leaving the trader with a $110 gain. Based on the capital at risk of $890, that works out to be a 12.36% return.


On the downside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the difference in the widths (10) multiplied by 100, minus the credit received. That gives us 10 x 100 — 110 = $890.


Maximum Gain On Tesla Stock Trade $1,100
----------------------------------------


The maximum gain can be calculated as 10 x 100 + 110 = $1,110.



The ideal scenario for the trade is that Tesla stock stays flat initially and then slowly drifts lower to close around 190 at expiration. There is a large profit zone between 180 and 200.


As the trade starts with delta of 7, so has a slight bullish bias to start. But that will flip to negative delta closer to expiry if the stock is still above 200.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 20% of the capital at risk, or if Tesla breaks below 185.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-toyota-motor-adr-tm.aspx), TSLA stock is ranked No. 8 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 44, an EPS Rating of 68 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 17.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

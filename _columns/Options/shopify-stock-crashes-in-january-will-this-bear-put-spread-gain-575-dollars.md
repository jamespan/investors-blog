**Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)) crashed 10.4% on Tuesday and is now decisively below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/). With growth stocks struggling in the last few months, traders might consider a bearish trade known as a bear put spread.




A bear put spread, as a debit spread, means we need to pay the premium in order to open the trade. If we place the bear put spread out-of-the-money, then we have a trade with low cost and a high reward potential if the stock drops.


On SHOP, options traders could set up a bear put spread by using the 1,190 strike as the long put and the 1,180 strike as the short put for the February expiration.


This trade would cost around $425 per contract with a maximum potential gain of $575. Placing the trade further out-of-the-money would create an even more favorable risk-to-reward scenario.


Shopify Stock: Managing Risk
----------------------------



To achieve the maximum profit, this trade would need SHOP to drop 2.96% between now and expiration on Feb. 18.


The break-even point for the bear put spread is 1,185.75. Calculate it as 1,190 less the $4.25 option premium per contract. So, if SHOP drops early in the trade it may be possible to make a profit at slightly higher prices.


At expiration, if Shopify stock is trading above 1,190, the entire spread would expire worthless. Thus, the trade would lose 100%, or $425.


For a trade like this, I wouldn't bother with a stop loss. Either the trade works or it doesn't. So I would trade an appropriate position size in case I suffered the full 100% loss. Alternatively you could set a stop loss at 50% of the premium paid.


As this is a bearish position, traders that think SHOP stock could move higher from here should not enter this trade.


Shopify stock is ranked number 28 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 58, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 83 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 33.


Earnings are set for the end of January, so this trade would have earnings risk if held to expiry.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

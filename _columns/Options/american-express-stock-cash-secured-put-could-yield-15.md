**American Express** ([AXP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AXP)) jumped more than 5% on Friday, clearing a buy point of 178.90 of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).




The company also boasts impressive ratings: a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 88, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 86 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 89.


One way to take ownership of a stock for less than the current price is via an option strategy called a cash-secured put.


A cash-secured put is a slightly less bullish trade than buying the stock. It is considered a neutral to slightly bullish trade.


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium or be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


Selling Put Options Works Like Covered Calls
--------------------------------------------


Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start with options. They are like a covered call and are pretty easy to understand once you know the basics.


Traders selling puts should understand that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price, meaning you would be forced to buy 100 shares.



Let's look at an example using American Express stock.


With the stock trading at 187.08 on Friday, investors could sell a January 2022-expiring put with a strike price of 180 for around $6.25.


An investor selling this put would receive $625 into their account, which would be theirs to keep.


If AXP stock falls below 180 by January next year, they would be required to buy 100 shares at 180.


The effective net cost of the position would be 173.75, thanks to the option premium received. That is 7.13% below Friday's closing price.


If the stock stays above 180 at expiry, the put expires worthless, leaving the trader with a 3.6% return on capital at risk. That works out to be 14.92% annualized.


Main Risk With American Express Stock Strategy
----------------------------------------------


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls quickly, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the premium received will help to offset the loss.


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if American Express stock fell to $0, which would see the trade lose $17,375, but most traders would cut losses long before then.


Cash-secured puts are a great way to generate a return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership.


If the put does get assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base and can potentially begin selling covered calls to generate additional income from the position.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

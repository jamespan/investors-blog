Do you write covered calls? Have you ever had the stock called away just before the ex-dividend date so that you did not get the dividend? And what about short puts? Have you ever been assigned and forced to buy the stock prior to expiration? If you answered, "YES!" to any of these questions, this article is for you.

  

Knowing when sold options — or "short options" — might be assigned can help you plan whether or not to close a position.

  

**The Mechanics of Selling Options**

  

When you sell an option two things happen. First, you get paid. Second, you take on an obligation. There are four ways to sell options.

  

First, you can sell a "covered call." This generally requires the lowest level of options trading approval from a brokerage firm. In the covered call strategy, you own the underlying shares and sell calls on a share-for-share basis. In this strategy, you know that you can fulfill the obligation of the short call, because you own the shares. The risk of the strategy, therefore, is on the downside. If the stock price declines more than the call premium received, then losses increase below the breakeven point.

  

Second, you can sell a call without owning the shares. This is known as "selling an uncovered call" or "being short a naked call," and this generally requires the highest level of options trading approval. Many firms will not allow customers to use this strategy without a substantial account balance and significant experience trading options. If you do sell naked calls, then you are risking that the stock price rises sharply. The higher the stock price rises, the more costly it is to buy the shares that must be delivered. 

  

Third, you can sell a fully cash-secured put. In this strategy, in the same account as the short put, you deposit a sufficient amount of cash to pay for the shares that the short put obligates you to buy. This strategy has downside risk, because the put increases in value — and loses money for the put seller as the stock price falls below the breakeven point.

  

Fourth, you could sell a put and post the minimum requirement of marginable securities without actually having the cash to buy the stock. This is known as "selling a put on margin" or "selling a naked put." Although the dollar risk of selling a naked put is equal to selling a fully cash-secured put, the percentage risk, however, is generally substantially higher.

  

**Why Options are Exercised Early (Prior to Expiration)**

  

The only rational reason to exercise an option prior to expiration is related to dividends. Owners of in-the-money call options, even if they plan to buy the stock, would prefer to own a call instead of the stock for two reasons. First, there is always a chance that some unexpected bad news will cause the stock price to plummet. In such a case owning a call has less risk than owning stock. Second, it is advantageous to wait until expiration to exercise a call so that the cash on deposit can earn interest for as long as possible.

  

Dividends, however, change the game.

  

By exercising a call the day before the ex-dividend date, the call owner becomes a stockholder just in time to receive the dividend. If the dividend is greater than the expected interest on a cash deposit, then most investors would willing take the risk of an unexpected stock price drop to get the dividend, which can be many times the interest earned on an annual percentage basis.

  

Another factor is the time value of the call. If the time value of the call's total price is greater than the dividend, then it would be more profitable to sell the call to capture the time value and then buy the stock to get the dividend. So, when the time value is "too high," a call will not be exercised for the dividend.

  

Dividends also change the game for owners of in-the-money puts, but in a different way.

  

If a trader owns an in-the-money put and also owns the stock, then this trader wants to keep the stock to get the dividend. However, once the dividend is received, then the trader wants to sell the stock so that interest can be earned on the cash proceeds of the stock sale. This means that in-the-money puts are exercised on the ex-dividend date — when the dividend is assured to the stock owner — if there is little or no time premium in the put. If the time premium of the put is greater than transactions costs, then the trader would simultaneously sell the stock and sell the put to capture the time value.

  

**Should You Worry About Early Assignment?**

  

Now that you can predict early assignment with reasonable accuracy, should you worry about it?

  

The answer to this question depends on your objective. If you sold a covered call hoping to sell the stock, then assignment achieves your objective. Missing the dividend should be viewed as a small disappointment, a cost of doing business, you might say.

  

If, however, you do not want to sell a stock on which a covered call has been sold, then you must repurchase that call at least two or three days before the ex-dividend date to be sure you are not assigned.

  

Regarding concern about assignment on short puts, the answer also depends on your objective. If you sold the put hoping to buy the stock, then assignment achieves your goal. However, if the put was sold with the sole goal of collecting the premium, then buying the put back before the ex-dividend date is the only sure way to avoid early assignment.

  

**Summary**

  

Early assignment of in-the-money options can generally be predicted. Owners of in-the-money options exercise such options because of dividend payments, and the timing of early exercise is the day before the ex-dividend date for calls and the ex-dividend date itself for puts.

  

As a trader or investor who sells options, understanding the likelihood of a short option being assigned early can help you avoid some costly trades.

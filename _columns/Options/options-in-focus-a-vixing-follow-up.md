While financial media outlets were literally up in arms Wednesday with panic, talk of hyperinflation and other bearish innuendoes meant to assist mass hysteria, this column dutifully dissected the market as being in position for faster money, contrarian bulls to buy the quick-to-nick pullback. 

  

The basis for our call was none other than the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX. Nominal highs of 23.2% didn't sound overly scary in their own right, but beneath the surface the market's fear gauge was doing more than a couple things to suggest a buyable low at or nearly close at hand. 

  

First off and as discussed, the mean-reverting sentiment index was clearly overbought relative to its 10-day simple moving average with a differential in excess of 25% between the two price lines. Secondly, that same action tested the November mini panic highs, as well as the 200-day simple moving average and looked to be setting up as a bearish shooting star candlestick pattern. 

  

As it turns out, while the broader market managed to strike marginally lower levels intraday on Thursday, the VIX never moved higherâ€”and our attention paid to the VIX, was largely spot-on. Fast forward two sessions and with 15 minutes left in the session, the VIX is off four points from its Wednesday highs at a level of 19.22% while the market is bouncing happily higher by about 1.20% from where our original prognostications lay. 

  

Some of today's pressure in excess of 10% on the VIX is the result of the looming weekend and traders once more, somewhat optimistically discounting the passage of time when there's no trading to be had. The funny part about that is sometimes painful lessons aren't so easily learned. 

  

In last Friday's "Wall Street's Lunch Option" column at Optionetics when the VIX was trading near 16%, we noted prevailing optimism that day effectively discounted the possibility of any catalysts rattling the markets while stateside investors enjoyed their little indigenous holiday. Hmm, it turns out we got it right from both sides in less than a trading week. So, while they say you can only nail a bottom or top but once in the market; our history with the VIX suggests you can come close to consistently putting that adage to rest.

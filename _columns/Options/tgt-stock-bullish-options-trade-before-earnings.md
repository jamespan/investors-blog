**Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) stock has a strong history of rallying ahead of its earnings announcement.




If fact, by my count, it has rallied on six out of the last seven occurrences. Of course, there's no guarantee past performance will repeat itself, but I prefer to have the odds in my favor.


TGT stock looks good technically with a series of higher highs and higher lows and an uptick in money flow.


The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are sloping upward.



TGT earnings are set for March 2 before the opening bell with the consensus for an earnings gain of $2.47 per share on revenue of $27.51 billion.


The options market is pricing in a 7.1% move in the stock in either direction, but this bull put spread will expire before the earnings announcement.


Volatility is elevated on TGT stock with an implied volatility percentile of 70%.


High volatility results in high option premiums which can be good for bull put spread traders.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish TGT Stock Option Trade**
----------------------------------


Traders who think TGT stock will rally or at least not drop by too much could look to sell a February 26 190 put and buy a February 29 185 put.


As of yesterday, this spread was trading for around $1 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $100 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $400.


That represents a potential 25% return on risk in nine days as long as TGT stock remains above 190.


If TGT stock closes below 185 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $400.


Ideally the stock continues to rally in the lead-up to earnings and the spread expires worthless.


TGT stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 89, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 91 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 68.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

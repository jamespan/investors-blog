Iron condors can produce a return on stocks that stay within a specified range over the trade period — even in a megacap tech such as **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). This can be a welcome change for buy-and-hold investors who are reliant on markets always going up. So, how does Apple stock shape up with this trade?




Just for review, options traders can set up an iron condor via a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. The idea with the trade? Profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction.


Apple Stock Today
-----------------


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), AAPL ranks No. 2 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 89, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 82 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 85.


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the April 21 expiry, we could sell the put option with a 150 strike price and buy the 145 put. That spread sold on Tuesday for around $0.70 in premium per contract.


Then, set up the bear call spread. Sell the 170 call and buy the 175 call, which recently generated $0.60.



So, in total the iron condor for this trade in Apple stock will generate around $1.30 in premium.


The profit zone ranges between 148.70 and 171.30. Calculate it by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received. 


As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 — 1.30 x 100 = $370. Therefore, if we take the premium ($130) divided by the maximum risk ($370), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 35%.


How To Control Risk
-------------------



If price action stabilizes then iron condors will work well. However, if Apple stock continues to bounce around, the trade will suffer losses.


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $130. So, consider setting a stop loss at 1.5 times the premium or around $195.


One potential drawback of this trade is that AAPL's IV (implied volatility) rank currently stands at a relatively low 14%. It may be more advantageous to initiate this trade when the IV rank is slightly higher. However, IV rank is not the only factor to consider when evaluating potential trades.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is back above the 21-day and 50-day moving averages after a strong few days. AMZN stock gets high ratings from [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx), so I'm comfortable being bullish here.




The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) for AMZN stock is 96 and the [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) is a best-possible 99. The [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is only 72, but that has improved in the last week.


AMZN stock currently sits in 20th place on the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list of leading growth stocks and is a good candidate for a bull put spread.


Implied volatility is 33%, which is lower than a few weeks ago, but still OK in terms of option selling strategies.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Bullish AMZN Stock Option Trade
-------------------------------


Traders who think Amazon stock will not drop below the 21-day moving average could look to sell a January 3100 put and buy a January 3090 put.



This spread was recently trading for around $3 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $300 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $700.


That represents a 42.86% return on risk between now and January 15 as long as AMZN stock remains above 3100.


If Amazon stock closes below 3090 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $700.

The break-even point for the bull put spread is 3097 which is calculated as 3100 less the $3 option premium per contract.


If Amazon's stock price drops below 3100, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

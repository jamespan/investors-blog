Just when you think you have the market all but figured out, it goes out and throws an unexpected curve ball. That's what looks to have transpired in the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX. After a couple nice signals over the past two weeks used for both entering into and more recently exiting or battening down the hatches with regards to bullish long delta positions, the VIX put together an admittedly slightly spookier, fearful and seasonally late price spike on Tuesday. 

  

Truth be told, we anticipated Monday's jump of 22% into a key test of the spooky 30% resistance level to have sufficiently neutralized an overbought market. The action followed last Thursday and Friday's message by the VIX to trim risk based on its combined short-term stretch of more than 17% relative to its 10-day simple moving average and a concurrent first test of 200-day simple moving average support. 

  

Last Thursday night and on these pages, we wrote about the over-aggressive short-term levels of bullishness in the VIX and action that was likely bound to trip up investors over the next couple sessions. Where we went astray was in thinking Monday's slightly aggressive dip of 2.50% in the S&P 500 in conjunction with the VIX would prove enough to cause a bullish reversal and jump start the market's notorious "Best Six" calendar period. 

  

We wrote as much last night at Optionetics in an installment of Traders Radar. Obviously, were obviously off in our analysis. At the end of the day, a "Terrible Tuesday" found the VIX spiking another 16% to 36%. That same action showed investor sentiment moving quickly from a neutralized, fearful bull to one, once more, overly-panicked with a closing spread differential of 16% relative to its 10-day simple moving average while testing its 30 and 50-day averages. 

  

What's next? Nobody but Goldman knows, maybe. But given our own short-term track record of being in front of the crowd two out of three times and what we'd guess to be a similar batting average over the long run using this type of analysis, the option to buy and sell simultaneously as a softer delta bull, rather than a bear built on panic, is our latest best guesstimate for the historical ledger.

No matter how one slices up straddles and implied forecasting, Wednesday's action in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has left a slightly bitter taste for delta neutral premium bulls. How's that so, considering all the headline misery over the company's uniform miss and with an hour left in the session, a gravitational pull lower of about 4.0% in the stock? The answer lies in the Weeklys July 600 straddle market. 

  

Pricing immediately in front of the earnings event had the Weeklys July 600 ATM straddle trading for $33.50 on implieds of 77%. For the "buy and hope" crowd intent of holding the long call / long put strategy and a position now mimicking a bearish deep in-the-money put, the straightforward downside break-even of 566.5 has proven slightly aggressive versus an intraday low of 570 and straddle value at that fleeting moment in time of $30. 

  

Worse yet, relative to a current bid of 577 in shares and still no call value to put a shine on the position, a price of $23 or so, is even further removed from breaking even. While there's still time to the "iTune" of two days left on the clock, this trader should be asking him or herself if they've changed their own outlook. From merely desiring a big move in shares, now the strategist should decide on whether or not they're bearish short-term so they might exit at a more opportune price in the next couple days or perhaps whether they're more fearful of a gap seeing some backing and filling and losses piling onto their effective "long put" position.

  

  

And what about the other guy or gal? Obviously, we can't speak for everyone as traders are free to exit, reduce or adjust positions prior to expiration. And of course, when we're dealing with a stock like Apple which has traded north of 1.2 million contracts, to say the least, that task becomes an exercise in futility. 

  

What we can say is for more advanced traders trying their hand at some dynamic or continuous hedging of deltas, Wednesday's 1 standard deviation move near 572 in the opening minutes, may have provided some incentive to hedge and flatten out a bearish lean of -100 deltas per spread. 

  

By purchasing shares an adjusted +2 Weeklys July 600 call (synthetically + real contract) is established. That move dramatically reduces the trader's dollar risk at stake. Unfortunately, with the combined volatility / theta crush due to earnings and expiration just two days out, as well as maybe appreciating a high near 581 held in check by the 50-day simple moving average; the chance for profitability looks slimmer than the anxiously-awaited iPhone5.

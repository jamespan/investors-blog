Some good news on the virus front could provide a catalyst for further stock market gains — and the airlines, including Delta stock.




Today, we'll look at an option trading strategy known as a cash-secured put on **Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)).


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium. Or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


They are very similar to a covered call and are quite easy to understand once you know the basics.


It's important that anyone selling puts understands that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


Delta Stock Option Trade
------------------------


Using Delta stock as our example, a trader selling the September 26 strike put could generate around $3 in premium per contract.


The put seller would have the obligation to purchase 100 shares of Delta stock at 26 if called upon to do so by the put buyer.



The breakeven price for the trade can be calculated by taking the strike price less the premium received. In this case, it gives a breakeven price of 23, or nearly 12% below Tuesday's closing price.


If the stock stays above 26 at expiry, the put expires worthless leaving the trader with a healthy 13.04% return on capital at risk.


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls precipitously, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the loss will be partially offset by the premium received for selling the put.


Maximum Loss
------------


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if Delta stock fell to 0 which would see the trade lose $2,300.


Cash-secured puts are a fantastic way to generate a nice return on stocks the trader is happy to own.

A mark against Delta stock is a very low [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 4 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 8, so this is definitely a contrarian trade.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment. This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation. Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

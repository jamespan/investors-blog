A volatile test of the 50-day simple moving average support in above-average distribution got the attention of option traders in IBD 50 constituent **Nu Skin Enterprises**  ([NUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUS)). That's a rare event as volume of about 3,400 contracts lifted the personal care and nutritional supplements outfit into the number one spot for unusual activity compared to its daily inactivity of about 250 contracts. 

  

Nu Skin puts found favor over calls by about 4-to-1 with the near-the-money April 55 put accounting for a bit more than one-half of today's overall volume. That's mostly unsurprising as a high short interest ratio of nearly 7.5 days lends itself to tricky and illiquid pricing as soon as one ventures their eyeballs beyond the nearest money call and put strikes.

  

The one interesting or even baffling item regarding the pricing, given the wide markets and short interest, is Nu Skin's puts aren't trading with a built-in skew over calls. Both surrounding money calls and puts are priced in the mid 30s. Most often in these situations and in particular with growth stocks which have trending higher, traders will see puts commanding higher prices to enter into a contract relative to the calls. Synthetic relationships in conjunction with hard-to-borrow risks for short stock holders, means a long call is less attractive than its synthetic counterpart the married put, which maintains long stock plus an equivalent ratio of puts. 

  

Bottom line, what's it mean? Directionally, not a thing in our view and at the moment we maintain no technical opinion on NUS. However, from a practicality standpoint and for those traders that remain interested in the name as a bullish position and maybe one which includes options from time to time; buy-writes and married puts make more sense, though basically the same amount of cents to enter, than their listed counterparts the short put and long call.

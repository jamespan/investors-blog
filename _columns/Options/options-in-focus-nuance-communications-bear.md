Some may be wondering whether the proverbial glass is half full for erstwhile growth stock **Nuance Communications**  ([NUAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUAN)). The former IBD 50 constituent, which specializes in voice and language software solutions such as "Siri" for **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has fallen a near perfect 50% from last summer's August lows to its recent all-time highs set in January. At the same time, shares of NUAN are testing its 200-day simple moving average and prior May 2011 highs for support. 

  

"Yeehaw!!??" One bear doesn't appear convinced the correction is over. Action in Nuance's option market Wednesday looks to be wagering the same, once tall glass of water, is only half empty as more than 12,500 January 2013 18 puts traded. The heavy action was commandeered by two large, offer side, block prints of 4,800 for $1.30 and $1.25. In conjunction with existing open interest of 5,300, the action is strongly suggestive of an opening buyer. 

  

Without the involvement of stock, either as an unlikely married put or some ratio of long shares to long put contracts, a naked long bearish position would require nearly 34% at expiration in order to double in price to about $2.50 per contract. But with 275 calendar days wedged between today and that eventually day of reckoning and given the fore-described key support situation for bulls, one bear appears to be doing more than just talking the talk with something other than an iPhone.

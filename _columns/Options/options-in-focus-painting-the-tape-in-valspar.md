As far as option traders are concerned, **Valspar** ([VAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VAL)) is far from a household name. However, ahead of Thursday's ex-dividend, a couple interested traders did manage to paint the tape with unusually heavy call volume in the paints and specialty chemicals outfit. 

  

The game being played is one tied to capturing the company's $0.20 quarterly payout for shareholders of record Thursday morning. In order to execute and successfully walk away with the dividend, traders look to enter into short deep call positions in strikes with extrinsic or put value that is less than the price of the payout. Pre-arranged buy-writes swapped back and forth for even money or verticals traded for the max value of the spread are the most common means of getting short the selected call. 

  

Also required is the need for sufficient open interest. In the end, today's dividend gamers are effectively betting on some of the existing pool of long call holders forgetting or deciding not to exercise their contracts. For each contract left unassigned, there is a short call position, which will in effect lose $0.20 in value come tomorrow morning and all else being equal. 

  

In order to make the play work, today's traders are exercising their long call contracts as part of the admission into the dividend game, which will convert into long stock. This means if one or more of their short calls are left unassigned by the Options Clearing Corp's lottery style exercise / assignment process, he or she will wind up with a buy-write position on that strike effectively put on for the price of the dividend. 

  

Looking at the board, all of today's dividend interest is focused on the 40 and 45 calls with several block prints adding up to 2,880 and two lots of 500 versus open interest of 960 and 624. With shares near 48.75, both of those very inactive put markets are priced "$0.00 / $0.20" or "no bid, at $0.20." What's that mean? Basically and said another away, if those traders get away with the dividend they'll be selling naked puts for the offer price. 

  

All things considered, that's not exactly a huge edge, but at the same time it also likely gives them a better shot at getting away with the desired position. Given Valspar's general lack of interest in its options, all I can think of is be careful what you wish for as any need to paint the tape as a concerned bull is going to prove that much more difficult.

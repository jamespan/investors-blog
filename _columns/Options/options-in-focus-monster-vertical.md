While the S&P 500 toys with its own monster breakout around its October highs and the closely watched 1300 level, one name fittingly sporting a monster breakout to fresh all-time-highs is **Monster Beverage Corp.** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)).

  

The IBD 50 constituent was discussed last week in this column with a detailed eye on both its admittedly, slightly-flawed four month ascending base and listed calls and puts to "protect and maybe even juice up one's stock holdings." 

  

With the breakout in place and Monster's options still only moderately delicious for either outrights and some two-sided spreads, one position idea we like to ensure keeping the trading account bubbly is a slightly out-of-the money February 105 / 110 bull call spread.

  

  

Priced for $1 late in Tuesday's session, using 2% portfolio risk on a model $20K account would allow for 4 verticals to be placed. This means the trader wouldn't need to worry about discretionary money management in order to keep any potential losses of the small and manageable variety. Not that we personally mind that idea, particularly so if shares fell below $96 and we were able to walk away with a loss closer to 1% of the max risk. 

  

And on the upside, if during the next 30 calendar day's bulls continue to guzzle up shares, it would take less than 10% from today's idealized breakout of $98.46 to realize a return in excess of 100% on the initial investment. In seeing how the signal price was traded through with a bullish gap, the luxury of this type limited risk strategy which allows one to breathe a bit easier regarding any future minding of that gap; makes even better sense and cents of it all.

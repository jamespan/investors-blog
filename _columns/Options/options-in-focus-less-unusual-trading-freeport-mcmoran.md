Option trading in miner **Freeport McMoran** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) was running well above normal Wednesday as the stock flirted with its 50-day moving average. But sometimes the simple observation of the likes of heat-seeking action being involved isn't enough, as was the case Wednesday. 

  

The real story behind today's volume was Freeport McMoran experienced an ex-date Wednesday tied to its 2-for-1 stock split. This price adjustment impacts its options and those traders existing positions in much the same way as it would a shareholder. Namely, any held calls or puts are doubled with regards to the quantity held and premiums or the costs of those option are reduced by half. 

  

The other important consideration and unlike holding long or short stock is the strike price is also cut in half. For example, regarding FCX's options last night's at-the-money February 114 call, which closed at $3.70 is now the February 57 call. All else being equal, that same call would be priced at $1.85 per contract. 

  

If a person was long 5 of the calls coming in today, they'd find overnight their broker with help from the Options Clearing Corp, had adjusted their position to 10 calls. We know this to be true as the total dollar outlay of $1,850 (5 x $3.70 or 10 x $1.85) is the one in the same. Were that not the case and some other pricing were allowed to pass (barring an error), there'd be some type of arbitrage to take care of and wipe out the discrepancy. 

  

Back to Wednesday's now determined less-unusual but still heavier-than-average (adjusted) volume, it's easy enough to realize with positions doubled, any exiting "to close" trading would by itself increase contract volume two-fold relative to a situation where a split had not occurred. 

  

Secondarily and as with stock, if an investor was willing to set aside $1,850 into the likes of the at-the-money call prior to the split; all else being equal, they'd now be purchasing twice the amount of contracts and also acting to increase trading activity by a factor of two.

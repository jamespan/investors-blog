Options are a tremendously flexible tool for investors. So far we've looked at [bull put spreads](https://www.investors.com/research/options/amgen-stock-option-trade-offers-16-28-percent-profit-potential/), [butterfly spreads](https://www.investors.com/research/options/facebook-stock-options-how-to-trade-butterfly-spread-for-neutral-price-action/) and [covered calls](https://www.investors.com/research/options/verizon-stock-increase-yield-by-16-6-percent-with-covered-calls/) to name a few.




Today I want to look at a strategy called a synthetic long stock. Let's use **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stock as our example.


What Is A Synthetic Long Stock Trade?
-------------------------------------


A synthetic long stock trade is a way of taking an equivalent long exposure on a stock without having to put up any capital other than the margin requirement. The strategy is constructed by selling an at-the-money put and buying an at-the-money call.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wOPTIONS052820-300x170.jpg) NFLX stock has experienced a minor pullback in an overall uptrend and is ranked No. 1 in its movies group in most IBD ratings. The stock holds a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an EPS Rating of 99 and an RS Rating of 91, [according to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-inc-nflx.aspx).


Assuming an investor wanted a bullish exposure via a synthetic long, they would sell a 420 put and buy a 420 call.


Recently the Dec. 18-expiring 420 put was trading around $55.20 and the 420 call was trading around $55.50.


Therefore, a December synthetic long stock trade would only cost $0.30 per contract, or $30. To calculate this cost, simply multiply the premium of 30 cents by 100. One option contract is equivalent to 100 shares, either in a call or a put.


Netflix Stock: What's The Catch?
--------------------------------


I'm glad you asked. As the name suggests, this is a synthetic long position and the trader has a similar exposure to owning 100 shares of the underlying stock. That exposure would cost about $42,000 if the investor bought 100 shares.



So this is a big position and only appropriate for larger accounts.


Even though the option trade only costs $30, the investor could still lose $42,000 if Netflix stock went to zero.


The advantage of the trade is that an equivalent exposure to owning 100 shares can be gained for only a fraction of the cost.

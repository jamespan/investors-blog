The January rally has some investors nervous about a pending correction. Yet these same investors are reluctant to sell stocks for fear of missing out on further price advances. Did you know there is a way to get the best of both worlds? You can keep your stock and protect most of your gains at the same time.

  

This article explains just one of many risk-reducing strategies using options. The concept is to purchase put options to protect a stock holding just like homeowners buy insurance. First, the strategy will be discussed, and then an example using a stock recently featured in IBD will be reviewed.

  

**The Basics of Buying Puts**

  

Buying a put is a simple option strategy. While options are not suitable for all investors, a purchased — or long — put tends to rise in value as the price of the underlying stock falls, provided the decline in stock price is great enough to go beyond the break-even point.

  

The risk of buying puts is that the underlying stock does not fall sufficiently prior to expiration and the put decreases in value as the expiration date approaches. The maximum risk for put buyers is the total amount paid for the put including commissions. 

  

**The Protective Put Strategy**

  

When the purpose of purchasing put options is to protect a stock holding, the expected rise in the put’s value is intended to reduce the decline in stock price. Although the "total portfolio value" (value of stock plus value of puts) will decline by the cost of the puts, such an outcome could be substantially better than the decline in value of an unprotected stock.

  

Here is an example: Assume that Stock XYZ is trading at $85, that you own 100 shares and that the March 85 Put is trading at 4.00 per share. Nervous about the price action of the overall market, you decide to protect your accumulated profits in XYZ Stock by purchasing 1 XYZ March 85 Put (each put covers 100 shares of stock) for 4.00 per share, or $400 plus commissions. If the price of XYZ stock declines below the break-even point at expiration as you fear, then the increase in the price of the put will reduce the decline in price of XYZ Stock. The break-even point at expiration is the strike price of the put minus the premium paid. In this example, the breakeven point is 81.00 (strike price of 85.00 — 4.00 cost of put).

  

If the XYZ Stock declines to 70.00 at option expiration, then the 85 Put will be worth 15, or $1,500. This is a $1,100 increase in value over the cost of $400. The $1,100 increase in put value in this example partially offsets the $1,500 decline in the value of 100 shares of XYZ stock from $85 to $70. 

  

If the price of XYZ Stock continues on its upward path and if the put is held to expiration, then the put will expire worthless. The $400 paid for the put plus commissions will be lost and will reduce any further profit in XYZ stock. However, during the life of the put, you might rest easier knowing that the downside of owning XYZ Stock is limited.

  

The protective put strategy may calm anxious investors who are worried about staying in a stock and, at the same time, are reluctant to sell. While similar to buying insurance on a home, the protective put strategy has two goals. The first goal is to limit any decline in stock value if the market declines. The second goal is to keep a stock so that participation in a price rise is still possible.

  

**Current Example — EMN**

  

**Eastman Chemical**  ([EMN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EMN)) was listed in the [Monday, February 4, Market Pulse](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/020113-642964-stocks-bust-through-psychological-resistance.htm) as one of the Leaders up in volume to hit a new 52-week high on Friday, February 1. The EMN chart shows that the stock completed a cup and handle pattern and broke out to the upside at 61.85 on December 7.

  

At 73.50 at the close of trading on Friday, February 1, the stock is up 19% in eight weeks. If you were fortunate enough to have purchased EMN at its break-out point of 61.85, and if you are now torn between holding for a continued rally and selling for fear of a steep pullback or possible reversal, the options market gives you an opportunity to stay in the stock and protect most of your gains at the same time.

  

With EMN trading at 73.50 at the close on Friday, February 1, the EMN June 72.50 Put had an ask price of 4.30 per share. Purchasing this put allows the owner of EMN to stay in the stock for four months to June option expiration and ensures that a profit will be earned no matter how low the stock price might fall. The EMN June 72.50 Put has a breakeven stock price of $68.20 (strike price of 72.50 — put price of 4.30 = 68.20). So, if the stock price declines below 72.50 at June expiration and if the put is exercised, the result is the same as selling the stock at 68.20, a 10% profit from 61.85. If, however, the rally continues uninterrupted, then you keep the additional profits less the cost of the put.

  

Owning a put that protects a stock position can reduce the psychological strain of watching a stock pull back, because the put establishes a known selling price for the stock. If the pull back turns out to be temporary and the stock then rallies to new highs, the stock owner can still profit from the advancing stock price.

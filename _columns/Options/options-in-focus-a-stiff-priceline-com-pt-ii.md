Option traders nearly got it right in trying to price in the expected move with **Priceline.com**  ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)). But unlike with horseshoes, nearly isn't quite good enough in winning the game, particularly when it involves positioning with long premium. 

  

As discussed yesterday, an ATM Weeklys March 590 or 595 straddle market suggested a 68% or 1 standard deviation's chance of shares remaining within 9.20% of its prior share price near 592.50. With less than 30 minutes left in Tuesday's session and PCLN up about 7.0% near 632.50, a big-looking move nonetheless has fallen well short of the pricing built into the premiums implieds in front of the report. 

  

That's not to say there wasn't a profit to be had in holding the likes of the long straddle. There has been, but it certainly wasn't without risk and remains far from being a risk-free proposition. Despite the implied volatility crush, there are still three days remaining on the Weeklys contract life before expiring. As much, a 7% move compared to the forecasted 9.2% expected move has allowed for some very modest profitability to the tune of about $0.50 or $50 per straddle. 

  

Relative to the straddle's entry price of $43.25, the gain is less-than-terrific. Furthermore, continuing to hold without some sort of adjustment would be akin to outright gambling in our view as any type of counter move would only turn the meager profit into a loss and possibly a large one with only the slightest bit of profit-taking in shares required.

  

One spot where bulls certainly have failed to appreciate the report were Monday's most active Weeklys March 560 call. We noted that with the strike outside of the rather pricey expected move threshold of 9.2% we couldn't fault any would-be bulls deciding to go against the grain and use that particular strike as placement for a short call hedge. 

  

As it turns out that was a very expensive ticket to purchase for northern passage. Late in the session, Monday's favored call has been cut down by just more than half to a price of $1.25. Only the 645 call with a loss of about $2.05 witnessed a stiffer overnight "priceline" into the loss column. All the other strike calls from 590 through 635, with the exception of the 640's small $0.15 loss, managed to see profits and some sizable at that, due to those calls deltas and gamma factors which trumped the volatility crush.

One of Thursday's more fashionable tickers to tempt bulls was erstwhile growth outfit The **Buckle** ([BKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BKE)). Shares jumped nearly 7% by the closing bell and finished pennies above its corrective 10-month long base to fresh all-time highs after the niche retailer reported much stronger-than-expected same-store sales. 

  

Option activity was far from active and mostly in keeping with its daily theme of disinterest from investors, that is, with one decent-sized exception. An out-of-the-money "tight" diagonal using the March 52.75 call and April 52.50 calls was put up 418 times on two prints for an average price of $0.535 per spread. 

  

Assuming the trader was a buyer of the longer-dated contract, the question of why they'd want to put on a spread like this which theoretically caps their upside gains for the right to sell the March call for under $0.10, might be a good question to consider.

  

In executing the spread, a trader has risk of $0.535 versus being long the April call for maybe $0.65. In our book, that's not a measurable reduction in premium to justify the sale. This is particularly true if one looks at Buckle's individual spread markets which are far from tight and would make buying back the near-term contract a much more difficult affair likely to cost the trader one way or the other. 

  

So, why do it? My thoughts are the trader may have wanted to buy the April contract naked long. But in appreciating the poor liquidity and realizing it wouldn't get put up at a desirable price, the trader may have offered out this slightly less attractive alternative to attract either the market makers or another institutional trader to take the other side. 

  

  

The way we see it, while the new position may not be what the trader really wanted, the compromise is still most likely workable and going to give them what they wanted in the first place, namely the long April call. And for the other side, what they have might look very much like our illustrated risk graph, which adds 7,000 shares of long stock to flatten out the deltas at initiation. In the end, my view on these matters could be off. As a former market maker however, I can say I've been there, done that and put on positions that definitely required compromise to get the deal done.

**Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) is currently the [No. 1 ranked stock on the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/top10). So, here's an options strategy in Etsy stock that will allow you to buy ETSY stock at a 7.6% discount from the prior day's price.




The strategy, a cash-secured put, involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option in the online commerce innovator and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock.


The goal? Either see the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


Anyone selling [put options](https://www.investors.com/research/options/options-trading-how-to-start-using-options-how-to-manage-risk/) in general needs to understand that he or she may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


Etsy Stock: Setting Up The Cash-Secured Put Trade
-------------------------------------------------


For Etsy stock, a trader selling the Dec. 18 expiration monthly put with a 135 strike price on Monday could have generated around $550 in premium per contract ($5.50 in premium times 100 shares per option contract). Shares are falling in afternoon trading Tuesday, so the put premium (or value) has risen.


Conservative traders may prefer to wait to see if they can sell that contract at a slightly higher price to give the trade a bit of extra juice. The put seller would have the obligation to purchase 100 shares of Etsy at 135 if called upon to do so by the put buyer.


To calculate the break-even price for the trade, take the strike price less the premium received, which in this case gives a break-even price of 129.50.



That produces a 7.6% discount to Monday's closing price at 140.20. The maximum loss on the trade would occur if shares in the online commerce nexus for artists and artisans fell to zero, in which the trade loses $12,950. If the stock stays above 135 at expiry, the put expires worthless leaving the trader with a healthy 4.2% return on capital at risk in less than a month.


This is calculated by taking the $550 premium received divided by the $12,950 capital at risk.


Downside Risk
-------------


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls precipitously, the trade will suffer a loss; however, the loss will be partially offset by the premium received for selling the put.


Cash secured puts are a fantastic way to generate a nice return on stocks the trader is happy to own.

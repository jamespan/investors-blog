Earnings season is upon us again, and **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) is due to report on Oct. 8.


Domino's stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group, with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 86.


Let's check in to see what the options market is telling us about Domino's upcoming earnings.


With the stock trading around 425 Monday, the Oct. 9 expiring call with a 425 strike price was trading around $14.10 and the 425 put was trading around $14.20.


Combining the two, we get $28.30. This tells us that the option market is pricing in a 6.66% move in either direction (28.30 divided by 425).


With this information in hand, let's take a look at two opposing option strategies.


Long Straddle Strategy
----------------------


Option traders who think Domino's stock will see a larger-than-expected move could look at buying the Oct. 9 425 straddle.


This straddle would cost $2,830 and that is the most the trade could lose.



The break-even points would be 396.70 and 453.30. This can be calculated by taking the strike price of 425 then subtracting and adding the total premium paid.


Potential profits are unlimited on the upside and downside.


The last two times Domino's reported earnings, the move was well inside the expected range, but earlier this year Domino's stock moved 25.6% after the Q4 earnings announcement.


Straddle buyers will be hoping for a repeat of that action.


The opposite of a long straddle is, of course, a short straddle.


Short Straddle Strategy
-----------------------


Traders who think Domino's stock will stay within the expected range of 6.66% would take the opposite side of the trade and sell the Oct. 6 425 straddle.


Selling the straddle would generate $2,830 in option premium but would of course expose the trader to potentially unlimited losses.


Straddle sellers would be hoping for quiet action following the announcement and would see a profit if Domino's stayed within the break-even points.


Using options to trade earnings is a different style of trading, and it's important to be aware of the risks.

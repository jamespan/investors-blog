**Johnson & Johnson** ([JNJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JNJ)) is a stock that popped onto my radar today due to the fact that JNJ stock dropped below its 200-day moving average.




That's typically a bearish development and it led me to check the IBD stats. JNJ stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 52, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 71 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 39.


This is the sort of setup I'm looking for when scouting for bearish option trades.


Today, I'll look at a similar setup to the one we looked at on Monday which is a diagonal put spread.


For JNJ stock, I'll be looking to buy a March 19, 155 put for around $15.95 and sell a November 20 140 put for around $2.30.


The total cost of the trade is the net premium paid, estimated to be around $13.65 or $1,365 for a standard contract of 100 shares.


The strategy earns the most profit if JNJ stock closes right at 140 at November expiry where the profits are estimated to be around $500 per contract.


JNJ Stock: Bearish Option Trade
-------------------------------


If JNJ stock drops even further, the trade will still make around $300. This is the lowest profit if the stock drops and it doesn't matter how far it drops.



If I'm still bearish on JNJ stock after the November 20 expiration, I can sell another monthly put or simply hold the long put, the cost of which will have been reduced by the premium received for any sold options.


The net delta on the trade is -37 so the exposure is roughly equivalent to being short 37 shares of JNJ stock, although this will change as the stock moves and the trade progresses.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 20% and if the trade is down roughly $270 I would close it out.


Risk Management
---------------


Johnson & Johnson reported earnings on October 13th, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.


Adding some bearish trades to your option portfolio can help offset the risk of other bullish trades. They can also neutralize your overall market exposure.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

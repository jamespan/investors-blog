Wells Fargo stock has had a tough run recently. It all started with the fake accounts scandal in 2016.




That incident didn't actually impact the stock price too much, but it seems investors have finally had enough. This includes Warren Buffett, who reduced his stake in **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) by nearly 15% in the last quarter of 2019.


A lot of other investors have followed suit and the stock price has plunged from 52 down to 24. There is significant distribution in Wells Fargo stock and it still seems too early to try and pick the bottom here.



Wells Fargo stock is below declining 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages. That's generally a bearish sign for a stock.


Also consider the fact that it is a poorly rated stock at IBD with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of just 6, a Relative Strength Rating of 11 and an EPS Rating of 39.


Wells Fargo Stock: Bear Call Spread
-----------------------------------


Taking all this into account, Wells Fargo seems like a good candidate for a bearish option strategy known as a bear call spread.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call. The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiration.


On Well Fargo stock, a bear call spread could be set up using the $25 strike as the short call and the $30 strike as the long call.


As of today, this trade offered a 21.95% return on risk over the next six weeks when using the June 19 expiration.

The maximum profit on the trade would be $90 per contract with a maximum risk of $410.


The spread would achieve the maximum 21.95% profit if Wells Fargo stock closes below 25 on June 19. The entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the premium seller to keep the $90 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if Wells Fargo closes above 30 on June 19. In this case, the premium seller would lose $410 on the trade.


Bear Call Spread: Risk Defined Strategy
---------------------------------------


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk defined strategy and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


In this case, Wells Fargo could go to 50 (unlikely) and the most this trade would lose is $410.


The break-even point for the bear call spread is $25.90 which is calculated as $25 plus the 90-cent option premium per contract. Keep in mind that due to the bid-ask spread, you may not be able to get filled at these prices.


For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss of 20% of capital at risk, so around $80. Otherwise, if Wells Fargo broke back above the 20-day moving average at around 26, I would also consider closing the trade early.

  Options In Focus: Red Hat's Hat Tip for Bulls

Is it me or does the current and somewhat off-the-radar **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)) look like a well-constructed undercut double-bottom base with its handle now developing near mid pivot support? Well, it appears there was some agreement in the option pit today. 

  

In what I'd call very much under-the-radar activity, which I only happened to stumble upon almost by accident, there was an absolutely amazing amount of smaller and mostly sub 2 or 3 contract prints which hit the tape ranging in price from $6 to $6.50 per contract in Red Hat's fairly deep in-the-money June 41 call. 

  

Could this be the work of a newsletter or a broker call? It sure seems like it, but I have to say I've never seen anything quite like this activity as hundreds of these smaller prints began trading just before noon eastern and throughout the afternoon. Amidst the more than 3,900 total traded, the largest prints and a huge minority within the ranks of the day's transactions, were one or two-dozen sales of up to 50 contracts.

  

Due to sheer number of prints, rather one or two blocks, it's all but impossible to know if shares of RHT were tied to the play. If that were the case, then our initiating parties would most likely be opening buy-writes as you just don't hear about smaller traders in these numbers coming out of the woodwork and putting on synthetic long puts. The other possibility is today's traders were initiating simple long call purchases. 

  

Truthfully, I don't know which strategy one we're dealing with. It's also important to consider the latter straight up purchase versus a short call and long stock position, is inherently more bullish. That strategy, while limited in its risk, needs shares to move higher in order to profit. 

  

This particular long call also maintains a fair amount of premium risk at nearly 15% of the share price. As much and referring to the price chart of RHT once more but this time a bit less confidently; the June 41 call would be tough to handle if anecdotes such as "all gaps eventually get filled" anytime soon. All told, while I don't agree with buy-writes being labeled "conservative", this one does require a good deal of less labor on the part of bulls and even allows for some strong slacking off, while still able to appreciate a potentially threatening price move like only an option trader can.

This past Friday we discussed some unusual deep in-the-money June 41 call activity in a "somewhat off-the-radar" **Red Hat** ([RHT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RHT)). The flood of smaller prints over the course of three hours or so appeared to be the possible work of a newsletter or broker call. 

  

Our thoughts on that day's activity, which we weren't altogether too sure of those traders' true intentions, was that buy-writing, without making a recommendation per se; looked to be the more attractive position versus a more bullish long call purchase. 

  

Following a now more on-the-radar bullish call from the Mad Money last night due to what Doctor Cramer call's Red Hat's Accelerated Revenue Growth or "ARG"; Red Hat bulls using the buy write are still enjoying a bit less of the "ARGhh!" sometimes associated with those harder-to-handle delta strategies. 

  

Shockingly enough (quite honestly), shares of RHT are off about -1.40% in Tuesday's second half and still working (further) on what we described prior as a "well-constructed undercut double-bottom base" with a handle (still) being crafted around the stock's mid pivot. 

  

  

In lieu of the price action in shares so far, April Fool's option activity has been a bit of a joke but not really harmful for call buyers or any would be buy-writers and realistically, mostly in keeping with the broader market's own tight technical ennui of last couple sessions. 

  

Shown above to illustrate and better compare hats to other hats that various bulls like to wear with options, we're looking at a 7 lot June 41 buy write versus a 3 lot June 41 call purchase. The various sizing reflects similar and managed stop loss risk if shares were to do something more than just simply "fill the gap" and provide a bigger joke for bulls below roughly $38 a share.

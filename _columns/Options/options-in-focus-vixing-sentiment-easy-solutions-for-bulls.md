Don't look now, but late last week's optimistic price behavior and confident sentiment has turned bearishly complacent. Monday's lows in the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" which scratched just below 14% also stretched more than 15% below the notorious Fear Gauge's mean-reverting 10-day simple moving average. 

  

Differentials of 15% or more between the cash VIX and the short-term moving average are important as the price action, relatively speaking, is extreme and prone to moving in the other direction in order to neutral those same readings in sentiment. In conjunction with absolute levels in the fear gauge historically on the cheap side and within a point of its five year lows set in August and fresh four year highs in the likes of the S&P 500, it appears a very good time to trim portfolio risk. 

  

While many stock traders will opt to reduce the size of their stock holdings in order to shave their existing portfolio risk, an option strategy, which makes a good deal more sense when premiums are affordable like they are currently, is to hedge shares individually. The simplest way to manufacturer guaranteed protection against unwanted downside risk is to purchase a put one-to-one against the underlying stock. 

  

  

By purchasing the put the trader creates a married put or synthetic long call position. This position allows the trader to sleep comfortably at night by knowing unequivocally how much dollar exposure they maintain in the event of a bearish move in the underlying while still allowing for potential increased profits, should the underlying continue to move higher. Shown above and to illustrate is a legged married put in Apple (AAPL) which doesn't eliminate downside risk, but contains the position's percent exposure to less than 3% of the share price regardless of how low AAPL might move during the life of the purchased October 650 put. 

  

If traders feel the possibility of additional upside is not a strong factor, simultaneously selling an "at" or out-of-the-money call and forming a collar or a synthetic bull vertical might be considered. Without adjustments, the sale of the call means additional upside profits are capped, but the trader has the advantage over the married put position by reducing or eliminating the cost of the protective put purchase. 

  

Alternatively, though not recommended if one's portfolio consists of stocks with looming earnings or major announcements in the pipeline, if there isn't decent liquidity provision in the options, a trader can look to the S&P 500 for assistance. By beta weighting the dollar risk of one's individual holdings, the trader can come up with a simple yet effective married put hedge using the broad-based and ultra-liquid product to eliminate, in theory at least, nearly 100% of the portfolio's systematic market risk. "What's beta, you ask?" If you did, tomorrow's classic lesson on putting portfolio management theory to work is for you.

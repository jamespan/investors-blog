As a trading vehicle, options are favored by yours truly. That should come as little surprise. I write our nightly gospel extolling the virtues of this type positioning as our column header teases. However, the option market is far from perfect and there are some areas, which can still stand improvement. 

  

One such spot where I feel the need to vent is when I see a spread quoted in a liquid product, which nonetheless is essentially smoke and mirrors due to a mix and match best bids and offers of various exchanges packaged together. Honestly, if we can't get a fill, why even bother? Case in point and of all products, I'd like to call to the stand, the **S&P 500 ETF**  ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)).

  

Very recently, I tried to close down an out-of-the money butterfly for a meager and disappointed $0.09 credit after working hard to leg into it a couple weeks back for a small credit. The spread was bid NBBO for $0.09 as I placed the order, so in effect I was trying to hit the "national best bid offer" quote. 

  

Almost immediately thereafter, this quoted market was slightly improved with a $0.12 bid / $0.26 ask. Admittedly, conditions were a tiny bit bouncy but overall, they'd be pretty tepid by current market standards. That said, on at least three different occasions over the course of a handful of minutes, the $0.12 bid appeared, as well as numerous slightly softer bids that either matched or were also above my offer price, as I let the order sit on my broker's platform to no avail. 

  

"Sorry, folks the park is closed." I'm reminded on Chevy Chase's National Lampoon's Vacation where John Candy stops the Griswold's at the park gate and delivers the bad news—you can't get in. Given, the spread wasn't trading through my bid. I guess that's the good news. 

  

Actual volume while present wasn't thriving like it was for the at-the-money 120, 121 and 122 strikes. This particular fly, without getting too specific involved wishing for a quick dip below 119 or maybe the 50-day simple moving average at 118 in order to have improved profitability for sure—and gee I guess, an actual fill from technology that sometimes still fails to improve our lives.

Investors often hear the word "volatility" or one of its derivatives to help describe price action in the market. But for option traders there are a couple types of volatility which are important to learn as they relate to the pricing of calls and puts. 

  

The broader usage of volatility is most often associated with underlying price movement or statistical volatility of a certain individual security or an index such as the S&P 500 over a certain period of time. That price movement can be described with past or historic volatility based on a holding period such as daily or weekly prices or other choices such as longer-term readings like 90-day statistical volatility. 

  

There's also future or forecasted volatility to consider. Future volatility is generally determined using some amalgam of historical volatility. And whether traders realize it or not, that outlook on what underlying prices are likely to be doing beyond today is at the heart of another important measure known as implied volatility. 

  

Implied volatility is simply, well not really, a mathematical expression in yearly percent terms based on one standard deviation of what the going market price for a call or put are. Thus, when you or I might decide to pay $1.15 for a May call, the other side might insist we paid too much at 60% IV when shares trade at 50% based on a 30 day statistical or "30SV" reading. That may be true, but then again, that trader is also unlikely motivated by the same wiggles over a certain period that some refer to as a square box or cup-with-handle and lead one to guesstimate a slightly different future forecast for price volatility.

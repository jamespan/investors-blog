This is the fourth of a series of articles on vertical options spreads and the second of three specifically on bull put spreads. Vertical spreads are an intermediate-level options strategy with a wide variety of uses. Traders who use vertical spreads must first understand the strategy mechanics, i.e., what happens at expiration. Second, it is necessary to understand the nuances of the price behavior of vertical spreads prior to expiration, and, third, a two-step plan for trading a vertical spread is an important part of using vertical spreads successfully.

  

**Bull Put Spread Reviewed**

  

The sale of one put and simultaneous purchase of a second put with the same underlying and same expiration but with a *lower strike price* is known as a bull put spread. Graph 1 illustrates a Bull Put Spread in which one XYZ 90 Put is sold for 8.00, and one XYZ 80 Put is purchased for 3.50.

  

Outcome 1: Stock price below the lower strike price. In this outcome, the short put is assigned (stock is purchased at the upper strike) and the long put is exercised (stock is sold at the lower strike). Result: no stock position and the maximum loss is incurred.

  

Outcome 2 Stock price between the strikes: In this outcome, the short put is assigned (stock is purchased at the upper strike price) and the long put expires worthless. Result: a long stock position is established.

  

Outcome 3: The stock price is above the upper strike. In this outcome both puts expire worthless. Result: no stock position and the net premium is kept as income, which is the maximum possible profit.

  

**How Stock Buyers Might Use a Bull Put Spread** 

  

As the following example describes, the bull put spread strategy is perfectly suited for investors who seek to buy stock below the current market price and limit risk at the same time. 

  

Laura is a conservative investor who wants to buy XYZ stock, not at its current price of $57.00, but at $54.00. Also, while Laura believes that $54.00 is as low as XYZ stock can go, she knows that she might be wrong. If the price dips below $50, then Laura would take her loss by selling her shares. Note that $50.00 is about 8% below $54.00 and consistent with the CANSLIM principle of limiting losses to 8% when stocks decline.

  

Instead of buying XYZ stock now at $57.00, assume that Laura establishes the XYZ 50-60 bull put spread by selling one 60 Put at 7.00 and, simultaneously, purchasing one 50 Put for 1.00 for a net credit of 6.00. Remember, unlike stock, options do not include dividends or voting rights.

  

At option expiration, the price of XYZ could be above $60, between $50 and $60, or below $50. If XYZ is above $60, then both puts expire, and Laura keeps the net premium received of 6.00 per share or $600 per contract. This profit can be viewed as a consolation prize for the stock rising rather than staying below $60 as Laura had forecast.

  

If the price of XYZ stock is between $50 and $60, then Laura’s short 60 Put will be assigned, and she will achieve her objective of purchasing XYZ stock at an effective price of $54.00 (the assignment price of 60 less the 6.00 net premium received from the spread). If XYZ is below $50 at expiration, then the maximum potential loss of 4.00 per share or $400 per contract will occur. The maximum potential loss of a bull put spread is the difference between the strike prices less the net premium received.

  

**Advantages and Disadvantages**   
For Laura, a stock buyer, the bull put spread strategy has two advantages over placing a limit-price buy order at $54 and then placing a stop-loss order at $50. First, a stop-loss order does not guaranty a maximum loss. If XYZ stock were to trade through $50, perhaps because of a "gap-lower opening," then Laura’s stop-loss sell order may get executed at a price below $50. Second, a stop-loss order must be filled if the stock trades at or is offered at or below the trigger price. With options, however, unless an assignment notice is received, the position remains open, which leaves open the possibility of benefiting from a stock price rise.

  

**Risk of Early Assignment**

  

Positions involving short stock options in the U.S. involve the risk of early assignment. This means that the writer of a put option might be required to purchase the underlying stock at any time that a short put position is open.  Since one component of a bull put spread is a short put, investors and traders who use this strategy must have a contingency plan for an early assignment. If sufficient excess cash (or excess marginable securities) is available, then the stock can be purchased without fear of a margin call. However, if a bull put spread is established without the ability to purchase the underlying stock, then early assignment of the short put might result in a margin call. This could trigger the sale of the stock by the broker if the required additional capital is not deposited by the deadline.

  

**Summary**

  

A bull put spread is a strategy that brings in option premium and limits risk at the same time. For a conservative investor who wants to buy stock below the current market price, a bull spread creates an obligation to buy stock at a price equal to the strike price of the short put less the net premium received.

  

If the stock price at expiration is above the higher strike price, then the net premium is kept as income. This is the maximum potential profit of the strategy. If the stock price is between the strikes at expiration, then a long stock position is established. Finally, if the stock price is below the lower strike price at expiration, then the maximum loss is realized.

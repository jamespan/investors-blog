**Seagate Technology** ([STX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STX)) closed nearly 0.8% higher Tuesday and rose again Wednesday midday. Impressive action, given the general market weakness. STX stock is also trading above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and recently joined the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).




Investors who think STX stock is due to rally and don't want to risk significant capital can use long call options rather than buy the stock outright.


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (strike price) up until a certain date (expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options? They provide leverage (this can be both a good and a bad thing). So, assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of STX stock, he or she would have to invest around $10,250 at the current price.


Instead, the investor in STX stock could gain a similar exposure using a fraction of the capital with a simple call option. One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.


Buying one STX 80 call expiring on June 17, 2022, would require around $2,450 vs. $10,250.


Managing Risk
-------------



The break-even price for this call option equals the strike price plus the premium paid. So, in the case of STX stock, this option trade would make the break-even price 104.50. The most the trade can lose is the premium paid of $2,450, which would occur if STX finished below 80 on June 17.


However, if STX stock shoots higher, the upside is unlimited. Using options in this way can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock without risking as much capital as would be required to buy the stock outright.


Another Option
--------------


Savvy traders can further reduce the risk by selling an out-of-the-money call in STX stock, turning the trade into a bull [call spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/options-trading-in-growth-stocks-can-life-storage-deliver-133-percent-profit-lsi-stock/).


For example, selling the July 17, 125 call would reduce the trade cost by around $420 but would also limit the upside above 125.


Seagate Technology is set to announce earnings around the end of January, so this trade would have earnings risk. STX stock is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Computer-Data Storage group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 87 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

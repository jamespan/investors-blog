In option trading there are few slam dunks but there are plenty of easy-to-appreciate layups using various outrights and spreads which help a trader gain an edge over simply trading shares naked long or short. One name which came across our radar today and which might stand to benefit bulls looking to "handle" things a bit differently with options is **Foot Locker**  ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)). 

  

Shares of FL forged a very common sizable upside gap Monday in sympathy with the broader market. However, a strong broker assist from UBS whose analysts raised shares to a "Buy" from "Neutral" while lifting its price target from $24 to $30 a share helped bulls elevate their offensive game into a leading position with gains of around 9% late in the session and what appears to be the finishing touches on a handle-on-handle pattern within a cup-shaped base. 

  

Checking Foot Locker's calls and puts, surrounding money options through February maintain relatively tight and uniform bid / ask spreads of $0.10 for contracts priced up into the $2 neighborhood. That said, verticals and calendars with a slight bit of patience, i.e. shares maybe moving slightly against the trader's desired direction for the stock are two spread types to consider. For those bulls seeking the slam dunk-like performance, an outright slightly out-of-the money with time on the clock remaining, might be an option to consider. 

  

To gain a bit of perspective, with shares near 23.10, the February 25 call is priced for $1.15 per contract. With its high 30s delta, the call will require a max move of shares jumping higher by 18% to 27.30 come expiration in order to double to $2.30. And during regulation play, i.e. prior to the contract's expiration buzzer, an early offensive move should bulls handling an even quicker double due to low implied volatility and theta risk heading into December's game.

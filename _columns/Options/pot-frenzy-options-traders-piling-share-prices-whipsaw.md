As the cannabis craze on Wall Street sends pot stocks on a wild ride, options investors are moving in fast, laying on bets that suggest gains in some of the biggest companies may at least temporarily fade.




Tilray was down 19% in afternoon trading Thursday, erasing almost half the gain it posted in a roller-coaster session a day earlier. Total put option open interest increased 24% during Wednesday's session, while open interest in the calls only increased by 7%. Taken at face value, that could imply growing bearish sentiment.


Conversely, the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF ([MJ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MJ)), a $710 million exchange-traded fund tracking marijuana stocks, was up 3.7%, adding to Wednesday's 3.9% gain. Tilray shares make up 14% of the fund's assets. During yesterday's run-up, call open interest in the fund surged by 27%, while the total number of outstanding puts increased by 12%.


While put open interest remains significantly higher than call open interest across both securities, one thing is for sure, interest in options is building.

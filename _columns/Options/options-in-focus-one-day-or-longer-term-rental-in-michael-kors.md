IBD50 constituent **Michael Kors**  ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) is seeing unusually heavy and lopsided option trading entering Thursday's final hour. Net volume of roughly 20,000 contracts is seeing more than 80% of the trading concentrated in the puts with two block prints behind the activity. 

  

Specifically, 7,750 August 40 puts traded for $2.40 in the opening minutes. A bit more than three hours later, an identical 7,750 August 36 puts were put up for $1.15. If you're of the mind the two are related and set up a vertical spread, you're not alone. However, as specific as that might sound, what actually happened, without talking to the parties involved firsthand, is a tough one to crack, though we'll give it a shot with the imperfect information that is available. 

  

One key factor complicating matters is whether the position is opening or closing. Not only does existing open interest nearly match today's volume, yesterday saw an identical size "spread" of 7,750 put up for $1.70 compared to today's "staggered" $1.25 net cost. The activity ultimately begs the question of whether a trader is doubling up a bearish or bullish bet, exiting for a loss or closing for a profit of $0.45 per spread. 

  

Higher implieds today on top of yesterday's bid and a vertical sporting slightly more vega per point in the 40 strike put suggest the trader may have added to a bear put spread. Also, the fact today's volume was spread out with the 40s trading first during this morning's "EU" euphoria (helping gap shares higher) could point to a bear trying to fade the move and receive a better price for a second vertical by waiting to sell the 36 strike put on anticipated weakness later on. 

  

On the other hand and a scenario we like slightly more, today's action might represent a trader exiting a bull put spread. A profit of $0.45 may not sound all that enticing compared to the full $1.70 potential, but a more detailed interpretation of "higher implieds", skew and the vertical's vega, could hint at just that sort of closing buyer. 

  

Digging a bit deeper into the pricing of implieds the past couple days reveals that while premiums lifted Wednesday, the increase was actually much smaller than today's bid. In fact, it appears the 40s and a contract now sporting more vega relative to the 36 put, saw implieds push higher by a handful of points compared to the typically upwardly skewed, lower strike put which remained largely flat. 

  

That's odd behavior. But if we reestablish the intentions of the early block print in the 40 put as a trader wanting to close long deltas in fear of the bullish opening gap faltering during the session and looking to leg the long 36 put for more opportune prices later on, it seems to make sense enough, even if $0.45 doesn't do it for you.

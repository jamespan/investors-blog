Adobe stock has experienced an impressive rally since the March lows and is now consolidating those gains. The highly ranked stock is holding above a rising 50-day moving average, which could provide a good entry point for bullish investors.




**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) stock is on [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) with a best-possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99.


Option traders wanting to take a bullish exposure on Adobe stock could look at a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined-risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Adobe Bullish Option Trade
--------------------------



Traders who think Adobe stock will continue to hold above the 50-day moving average could look to sell a September-expiring put with a 430 strike price and buy a 420 put.


As of Friday, this spread was trading for around $3.30, which means a trader selling this spread would receive $330 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $670.


That represents a 49.25% return on risk between now and Sept. 18, as long as Adobe stock remains above 430. If Adobe stock closes below 420 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $670.


If Adobe's stock price dropped below the short put at 430, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Adobe is due to release Q2 earnings on Sept. 15, which could cause a big move in the stock.


This is where an options spread has an advantage over uncovered strategies. With a bull put spread, you always know the worst-case scenario even if Adobe stock tanks.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Albemarle** ([ALB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALB)) broke out to a new high on Friday and is currently the No. 1 ranked stock in the Chemicals-Specialty industry group.




The company last month announced earnings of $3.45 per share, which beat expectations of $3.03 and was up from $2.38 in Q1.


Albemarle is showing is showing mostly green check marks on its [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-albemarle-corp-alb.aspx), and today we will look at a bullish option trading strategy called a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to the December expiration, a 310-strike call option was trading around $27.25 on Friday, and the 320 call was around $23.35.


Buying the 310 call and selling the 320 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $390 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100), and the maximum potential profit would be $610 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


Risk Limited For This Options Trade
-----------------------------------


A bull call spread is a risk-defined option trading strategy, so if ALB stock closes below 310 on Dec. 16, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $390 premium paid.



Potential gains are also capped above 320, so no matter how high Albemarle stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $610.


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 280, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Albemarle is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 89 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96.

"Selling puts" is a strategy that is the subject of much controversy. It strikes fear in the hearts of some investors and draws yawns from others.  Why is there such a range of reactions?

  

This article will first discuss the mechanics and risks of selling puts, and then an example using a recently featured stock in IBD will be reviewed.

  

**Selling Puts: Strategy Mechanics**

  

The seller of a put option is described as having a "short put position" and assumes the obligation of purchasing 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. In return for assuming this obligation, the put seller receives the premium that is paid by the purchaser. 

  

An example of a short put is: "sell 1 XYZ March 50 Put at 2.50." The initiator of this transaction assumes the obligation of purchasing 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 per share if an assignment notice is received. In return, the premium of $2.50 per share, or $250, in this example, not including commissions, is received.

  

**Risk and Profit Potential**

  

If the price of XYZ stock closes at or above $50 on the third Friday in September, then the 50 Put will expire worthless and the premium received will be kept as income. If XYZ closes below $50 at expiration, then the put will have value, and its owner will likely exercise the right to sell XYZ stock at the strike price of $50. The put seller will then be obligated to purchase 100 shares of XYZ stock. Note, however, that the put seller is effectively buying stock at $47.50 in this example, because the $2.50 put premium is kept.

  

**An Investment-Oriented Use of a Short Put**

  

Consider Geoff, a conservative investor, who finds XYZ stock to be an attractive investment, not at its current price of $50, but at $47.50. Assume also, that XYZ March 50 Puts are trading for 2.50 and that Geoff is not in any hurry to acquire XYZ stock.

  

If Geoff is forecasting that XYZ will trade in a range between $45 and $50 between now and March option expiration, then two of Geoff’s alternatives are the following. First, he might place a limit order to buy 100 shares of XYZ at $47.50. This is known as a "Good-till-Cancelled" (GTC) order. Second, he might sell 1 March 50 Put at 2.50.  In both cases it is assumed that Geoff deposits $47.50 per share in cash in his brokerage account to pay for the stock. Let’s compare the two strategies. Remember that commissions and taxes are not included in the comparison.

  

While the GTC order to buy stock at $47.50 is being represented, Geoff is obligated to buy 100 shares at this price. Between now and March expiration, the price of XYZ stock will either have stayed above $47.50, and Geoff will not have purchased any stock, or it will have traded below $47.50 and he can expect to have bought 100 shares.  If the stock stays above $47.50, then Geoff, in the case of the GTC order, will have earned nothing except interest on funds in a money market account.

  

If, however, Geoff sells a March 50 Put at 2.50, the premium is received. At expiration, if XYZ is above $50, no stock will be purchased. Geoff, however, gets to keep the premium. If XYZ is below $50 at expiration, Geoff is obligated to buy 100 shares at $50. Since he received 2.50 when he sold the put, his net cost is $47.50 per share. Assignment prior to expiration is also a possibility that Geoff should consider. Either way, however, the premium is retained.

  

**Discussion of Risk**

  

In the example above, Geoff is typically described as having sold a "cash-secured put." This means that sufficient cash to purchase the stock has been placed on deposit with the brokerage firm. If the put is assigned, then paying for the stock is a simple matter, just use the funds on deposit. The maximum theoretical risk of a stock price decline is the same as for any other stock holding purchased for cash. The maximum risk is equal to the amount invested, and Geoff should monitor the XYZ shares as he would any other stock holding.

  

**Current Example — QIHU**

  

**Qihoo 360 Technology** ([QIHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QIHU)) was mentioned in [The Big Picture column by Paul Whitfield on Friday, January 25](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/012413-641860-stock-indexes-mixed-but-each-suffers-distribution.htm), after having thrust 5% higher to a new high on Thursday only to then reverse and close down 3% on triple its average volume. The QIHU chart appears to have strong support near 27.00.

  

If you believe that 27.00 is a buying opportunity for QIHU, then the options market gives you an opportunity to collect some premium while waiting for the stock to trade down to that price.

  

With QIHU trading at 31.99 at the close on Friday, January 25, the QIHU March 28 Put had a bid price of 1.05 per share. This put has a breakeven stock price of $26.95 (strike price of 28.00 — put price of 1.05 = 26.95), so the stock price must fall below this point for selling this put to lose money at expiration. Also, the stock does not need to trade down this low in order for the put seller to buy the stock at this price. If the 28-strike put is assigned, which can happen at any price below 28 in this example at expiration, then the seller is obligated to buy the stock.

  

The maxim possible risk is the same as buying QIHU at $26.95. If the put expires without being assigned, the put premium is kept. The put price of $1.05 is 3.8% of the 26.95 cash deposit, which itself is a good return for the 47 days between January 25 and March option expiration.

  

**Summary**

  

Selling a put creates an obligation to purchase the underlying stock.  The profit potential is limited to the premium received, but the risk is substantial. Below the break-even point (strike price minus premium received) the maximum dollar risk of a short put position is equal to a long stock position.

  

The term "cash-secured put" is used to describe a short put position that is backed with sufficient cash on deposit in the brokerage account to purchase the underlying stock. Selling cash-secured puts can be viewed as a conservative, investment oriented strategy when the goal is to purchase the underlying stock and when there is no hurry to purchase it. "Selling puts" can be "risky" or "conservative." It depends on how you do it.

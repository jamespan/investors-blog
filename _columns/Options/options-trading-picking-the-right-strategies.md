Many options traders get overwhelmed by the number of options strategies to pick from. Even in a market rally, options trading can have unique challenges.


Traders need to understand some of the specific options rules when selecting a top performing stock. The most important part of picking a good options trade is first having a good stock trade. It is key to understand what factors to look for before picking an options strategy. Many options traders may believe buying a call is the way to go during a market rally but there is much more to it than that.


Options Trading: What's The Outlook?
------------------------------------


The first step of picking the proper options strategy is to assign an outlook to the stock.


As options traders, we can be very agnostic to stock direction. An effective way to do that is to assign an outlook scale from -3 to +3. In this context a -3 would be very bearish and +3 would be very bullish. In the middle of that scale would be 0, which is a neutral outlook and expecting very little movement.


This outlook must also be tied to a time frame for the expected movement. An example would be a stock with high relative strength breaking out to an all-time high from a flat base on increased volume. As an options trader with a three-week outlook it is assigned a score of +3.

Options Trading: Volatility Outlook
-----------------------------------


In options trading, knowing the outlook of the stock is the first half of picking the right strategy. The next step for options traders is to determine the volatility outlook of the stock.


One of the best ways to consider volatility is to think of inflated and deflated. If an option has higher volatility than its typical range it may have an inflated volatility value. If an investor buys an option with inflated volatility value, there is the possibility that even if the stock moves in the right direction the investor could lose money. The loss on the trade in that case could be attributed to the volatility being taken out of the premium.


An effective way of looking at volatility is in relation to its annual range. A good way to start is to take the last year of implied volatility and identify the high and low of the last year. Once the high and low are identified by dividing it in 3 parts then a strategy is assigned. The three parts are the top 20% of the range, the bottom 20% of the range, and the middle 60% of the range.


Generally speaking, if a stock is in the lower 20% of its volatility range the options premiums are deflated and become a buying opportunity. If a stock is in the upper 20% of the range the premiums are considered inflated, and become a better candidate to sell options. In the middle 60% of a volatility range the best options strategy may be some type of a spread trade.

Putting It All Together
-----------------------


So to put it all together, we would follow a process of first identifying a stock outlook and then determining which options strategy would best fit.

In the above [MarketSmith](https://www.marketsmith.com) example, a strong stock is identified in an uptrend. That uptrend is coupled with increased volume on a breakout. Those factors would assign a value of +3 for the stock outlook.

The above chart is the volatility outlook for **Amedisys** ([AMED](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMED)) over the last year. The high and the low of the year make up the boundaries, which are then split into three sections. Amedisys is in the lower 20%, which combined with the stock outlook would lead to selecting the right options strategy. In this case buying a call would make the most sense, but if volatility were just a bit higher a spread would be a more appropriate choice. Knowing the stock outlook and the volatility range are the first places to start when selecting the right options strategy.

Fiber optic outfit **Finisar Corp**  ([FNSR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FNSR)) reports after the close Thursday. Despite the uncertainty, bulls haven't been dissuaded from pushing shares to their best levels in a month while also confirming Monday's breakout above 50-day simple moving average resistance on a heavier volume gainer of 3.71%. 

  

For option traders appreciative of today's latest technical effort and less mindful of, or perhaps receptive to the stock's low laying fruit status on the daily, the near-the-money September 19 call priced for $1.70 would require a jump of 19% by expiration in order to realize a double in premium.

  

  

Following the report and in the immediate aftermath, the risk to this type of outright long premium position is not only a move lower in shares, but also a bullish reaction, which isn't strong enough to counter the impact of theta and vega risk. Shown above is what an illustrated 4 lot position priced at $1.70 per contract will be facing in the days ahead using an estimated drop of 25% in implieds and factoring out three days of time decay.

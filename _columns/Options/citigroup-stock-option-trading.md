Citigroup stock and other stocks in the financial sector have been in rally mode since the start of the year, but it hasn't been a straight line up.




**Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **JP Morgan** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) were flattened following the March Fed meeting.  At the time, it appeared rate cuts could be on the table — a negative for banks because it hurts their net interest margin. Banks borrow money at the short end of the yield curve and lend at the long end. Financials recovered nicely in April, putting Citigoup on the radar for a call-option trade.


Citigroup Stock Fades After Breakout
------------------------------------


Citigroup recently broke out from a [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) pattern. The buy point was 66.93.  The stock rallied to a high of 71.94 before pulling back. Its 50-day moving average, just below 66, is a support level to watch. Citigroup is the fifth-ranked stock in IBD's money center industry group based on its [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 64.


Citigroup has delivered nine straight quarters of earnings and revenue growth during a very challenging time for banks. That's a big positive. So is double-digit earnings growth expected this year and next.


Watch for Citigroup to make a run at its September high of 75.24. An option play to benefit from that thesis would be a straight call option with a September expiration to give the stock time to make a move. A 70 strike price stood at about $300 per contract. Granted, Citigroup stock has a lagging relative strength line currently. But if you are looking for financial exposure, an option can provide that with a lower cash outlay and a capped risk to your portfolio. The $3 premium was 4.4% of the stock price at the time, a reasonably-priced trade. The company's next earnings report in July could be the next catalyst for the stock.

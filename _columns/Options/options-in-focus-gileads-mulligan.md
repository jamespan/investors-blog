IBD 50 constituent **Gilead Sciences** ([GILD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GILD)) is atop the unusual option activity list this afternoon and for all the wrong reasons much to the chagrin of directional bulls. With about an hour remaining in Friday's session, sharesÂ were off 14% following the biotech outfit's disappointing results from "genotype 1 null responder hepatitis C patients" enrolled in its ELECTRON study.

  

On the option side, daily volume of about 12,000 has ballooned to more than 110,000 contracts in very evenly matched overall trade as evidenced by a put/call ratio of 1.05. Of more interest is how traders were anticipating the report and its results to act as a catalyst on shares. However, on this occasion, traders were also obviously caught somewhat off guard as to the timing of the release.

  

Closing premiums in the February contract which expire today reveal traders quite confident the data would not be released until after those options came off the board. The easiest way to understand or see the mispricing is to compare the at-the-money February 55 straddle versus the March 55 straddle as of last night.

  

The latter March volatility and long curve (gamma) spread was priced at fresh six month high implieds of 52%. The pricing amounted to a dollar cost of $6.50 per spread. Further, with less than 30 days until expiration, nearly 100% of its value was prone to increasing theta or decay risk if shares managed to stay near the strike.

  

At the same time, the February 55 straddle was priced on implieds of just 25% and less than half the dearly held March contract. In dollar terms and one day left before coming off the board, the spread closed at the measly price of $0.63 with shares at 54.81. The pricing obviously reflected the strong belief February would remain quiet through expiration and an attractive way to collect premium or simply wasn't worth buying for anything less than run-of-the-mill to cheap pricing.

  

Looking forward and in the aftermath of Friday's surprise, March has returned 30% or about $200 for straddle buyers as the size of the move has compensated for a drop of about 8 points in implied volatility. At the same time and shares near 47.10, the February straddle has returned more than 1,100% and profits of roughly $725 per spread. All told, it's likely the bulk of traders playing the game would like have a Mulligan. But trading long shots like February consistently have a way not making sense or cents over the long haul.

Options trading in a sideways market is more difficult than in a directional market, but the good news is that options trading for beginners with the market at all-time highs offers many opportunities. There are still a few important rules for an investor to remember before going out and blindly buying calls in a bullish market.


Strong Stocks In Strong Sectors
-------------------------------


Regardless of market conditions, investors need to remember that every good options trade first starts with a good stock trade. The best way to have a good stock trade is to follow a clear set of defined rules.


Starting out trades by looking for market trend and following [The Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) is the first way to find good opportunities. Once a strong opportunity has been found, only then should an investor consider an options trade.


The simplest thing to do for most options traders would be to simply buy a call. This acts as a stock replacement if the trade is a short-term opportunity. If an investor is looking for the long term play, then things change. In that case evaluating other strategies including covered calls, or cash secured puts makes more sense.


Options Trading Open Interest
-----------------------------


One of the challenges with options trading is having enough [open interest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/04/060904.asp). A growth stock that has strong momentum may not have enough retail interest. This means there may not be a high number of open interest contracts. The problem then becomes wider bid-ask spreads. A wider bid-ask spread makes it more difficult to realize a profit.


A good rule of thumb is to look at a bid-ask spread of 10% or less than the option premium. Many times options trading beginners will forget to look at this criteria and leave money on the table. When the market is at all-time highs the temptation for investors is to overlook this critical rule. One of the dangers is the "fear of missing out" taking over. This can lead to an investor forcing trades that don't fit their rules.


Use Multiple Strategies
-----------------------


In options trading, think of the strategies you know as tools in a toolbox. If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to be a nail. If an investor only buys calls their strategy will only be effective in a bullish environment with low volatility. Knowing strategies that are effective in multiple volatility environments will give an options trading beginner a leg up.


Simple [vertical spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/university/optionspreadstrategies/optionspreads2.asp) negate the effect of volatility in your trade. A simple vertical spread consists of buying one option and selling another with a different strike price in the same month. Using this style gives an options trader a more diversified toolbox.

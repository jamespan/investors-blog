Yesterday we discussed the merits of the collar strategy. For growth strategists that can appreciate accumulating shares on market weakness, as well as managing risk during what may seem like the best of times, a collar is certainly a position to consider.

  

Amongst highly ranked stocks in the IBD 50, one name which might be suitable for the collar strategy are shares of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). Not only are Netflix's options liquid and relatively tight for a ticker sporting a three digit price tag, the underlying also sports fairly decent price volatility with a 90-day statistical range value of about 40%.

  

For the collar trader making adjustments, volatility is a good characteristic. Wild price swings can allow the astute option trader to buy shares on weakness by swapping out deep puts for additional stock, when what might otherwise be a nauseating price move occurs. And on those other more pleasant occasions as the stock jumps happily higher, the collar trader can piece out the position and / or lock in profits and continue to improve their risk / reward profile.

  

Regarding Netflix, another potentially good development is shares held their longer-term 200-day simple moving average this week after correcting roughly 25% from its all-time-highs.

  

While the trader in the dynamic collar should be willing to accumulate on weakness given a strong enough pullback in shares like the one just witnessed; the strategy is ultimately a bullish one. That said, having some technical confirmation to start on a hopefully, quick profitable note to the upside is still more agreeable than having to be a collared bull ready to act i.e. immediately accumulate shares; but one sporting a paper loss nonetheless.

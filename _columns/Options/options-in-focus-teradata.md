**Teradata** ([TDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDC)) made a rare appearance in the top spot for unusual call and put volume for IBD 50 constituents Friday with more than 6,500 contracts trading compared to its daily average of about 600.

  

Shares gapped and trended lower to finish the day off nearly 10.50% in sympathy with a warning from enterprise data peer Informatica (INFA), which tumbled about 28% after reducing its Q2 top and bottom-line outlook. 

  

Of today's option volume, puts carried favor over calls by a 1.55-to-1.0 margin. The new at-the-money July 65 put saw particular interest with volume of 1,500 more than doubling its residing open interest of about 730. 

  

A firm bid in implieds which jumped about 20% from near 30% to roughly 36% suggests Friday's activity was driven by opening buyers and maybe some short contract holders looking to cover rather than accept the risk of assignment and perhaps a less desirable "targeted purchase."

  

The term "targeted purchase" refers to the strategy of selling a naked, typically out-of-the-money put, in an attempt to collect the premium. At the same time, if shares drop below the sold strike, the trader is supposed to be receptive to acquiring shares on assignment as it represents a means to buying the stock at a desired discount. Well, potentially "desired discount". If the trader exercises their right to another sort of targeted purchase prior to expiration i.e. closing out the put with a purchase, all bets are off the table, for better or worse.

With [stocks plunging](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-plunge-buffett-apple-stock/) on recession fears and the 12% drop in the Japanese Topix index, we need to be a bit more strategic with our option trades. Apple stock is one to look at.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) dropped below the 50-day moving average Monday, and Apple stock could be a good candidate for a bearish trade.


This can also act as somewhat of a hedge on a long-term stock position. Today, I'm looking at a bear call spread on Apple stock.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


3 Ways Apple Stock Trade Can Win
--------------------------------


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways, and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry.



A September-expiry bear call spread on Apple stock using the 230-235 strike prices can be sold for around $0.95.


Traders selling the spread would receive $95 in option premium, which is also the maximum possible gain. The maximum loss would be $405. That represents a potential return of 23.5% between now and mid-September.


The spread will achieve the maximum profit if Apple stock closes below 230 on Sept. 20. In that case, the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the trader to keep the $95 option premium.


The maximum loss will occur if Apple closes above 235 on Sept. 20, which would see the premium seller lose $405 on the trade.


Risk Of Trade Predefined
------------------------


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy, and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


A stop loss could be set if Apple stock trades above 225, or if the spread value rises from $0.95 to $1.80.


Because this is a bearish position, traders who think Apple stock could move higher from here should not enter this trade. The position starts with a delta of -6, meaning it is roughly equivalent to being short six shares of Apple stock.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-aapl.aspx), Apple stock is ranked No. 2 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 86 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 86.


Apple has already reported Q2 earnings, so this trade on Apple stock should have no earnings risk if held to expiration.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

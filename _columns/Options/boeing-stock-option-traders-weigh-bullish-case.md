Boeing stock has been the talk of Wall Street lately amid safety concerns regarding its 737 Max jet. The stock has been extremely volatile, and the jury is still out on whether the 737 Max problems will have a longer term effect on the company. Boeing's 200-day moving average around 360.50 remains a longer-term support level to watch.




**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) stock has been able to bounce back from prior setbacks. It had a well-publicized battery issue with the 787 Dreamliner plane back in 2011. There were no plane crashes involved, so a public-relations nightmare was avoided. Boeing was punished back then when the stock was trading in the 70s, but it didn't take long for the stock to recover.


Boeing Stock: Call Option Trade
-------------------------------


Dealing with such volatility, though, makes one pause. Is Boeing's recent price weakness an opportunity? Buying a call option is a great way to define your risk while capturing some upside, especially if some good news is dispersed or you think the selling is overdone. Straight options for Boeing stock are rather expensive due to high implied volatility. Elevated volatility simply means the market is expecting much wider price moves than normal. But it doesn't specify the direction, whether the expected move is up or down.



An options play with the June 400 call option covers the coming earnings season. The 400 level is just above the 50-day moving average, which could offer resistance. This call option has a cost of roughly $635 per contract. That's excellent leverage with the option at just 1.7% the price of Boeing stock. And it includes their first quarter earnings report. This trade breaks even at the $406.35 level by the June 21 expiration. That requires an 11% move from the current price. The most you could lose is $635 per contract if the option on Boeing stock goes to zero.


Boeing stock hit a high of 446 in early March. It owns a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 85 from IBD, which recently ranked it 10th in the aerospace/defense group.

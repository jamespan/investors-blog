The tech sector continues to remain weak and after yesterday's action, I'm [rethinking my bullish stance](https://www.investors.com/research/options/sq-stock-bull-put-spread/) on **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) stock. I'll also discuss a ROKU stock bearish calendar spread.




One trade I like to use on stocks that might suffer large drops is a bearish calendar spread.


These trade are negative delta and positive vega (these are option "Greek" measurements), so can do quite well when the stock drops.


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias in which case they would use puts.


Let's take a look at an example of a bearish calendar spread on **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) stock.


ROKU Stock Bearish Calendar Spread
----------------------------------


With Roku stock trading around 340, let's assume the trader thinks it might drop down and tag the 200-day moving average around 250.


The trader could sell the April 250 put and buy the May 250 put.



Selling the April 16 250 put option will generate around $175 in premium and buying the May 21 250 put will cost around $675.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $500 per spread and that is the most the trade can lose up until the first expiration.


The estimated maximum profit is $1,750 but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if ROKU stock trades down around 250 in the next few weeks, the calendar spread will increase in value, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


I would set a profit target of 30% and a stop loss of 20%. For position size, I would risk no more than 2%-3% of my capital.


Bearish traders might also consider something simpler like a bear call spread, similar to [this trade in Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tsla-stock-bear-call-spread/).


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

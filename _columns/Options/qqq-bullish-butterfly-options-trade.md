Investor leverage is [quite high at the moment](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-stock-market-rally-gamestop-freefall-pinterest-peloton-snap-earnings-movers/), so traders wanting to take bullish exposure may want to think about doing so in a limited risk way.




One way to do that is through options trading using bullish butterfly spreads.


Taking the Nasdaq Composite for example, investors could use the Invesco QQQ Trust EFT ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) to gain some upside exposure in a low-risk way.


Butterfly spreads involve 3 different option strike prices, all within the same expiration date, and can be created using either calls or puts.


By trading a butterfly with a bullish bias we can place the trade cheaply and have a large potential payoff.


Let's take a look at how that might look on QQQ.


Buy 1 March 19 340 call @ 5.90


Sell 2 March 19 350 calls @ 2.70


Buy 1 March 19 360 call @ 1.20


This trade only costs around $170 per spread but has a payoff potential much higher than that.


The ideal scenario is for QQQ to be right around 350 at expiration on March 19. You have to get pretty lucky with a trade like this, but sometimes they work out.



The maximum loss on the trade is equal to the premium paid of around $170 per contract. This would occur anywhere below 340 or above 360.


The maximum potential profit on the trade is $830.


Taking a low-risk trade like this can be one way to participate in any further rally without risking too much capital.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

With less than an hour to go in Thursday's rather classic-looking summer doldrums inaction, a "potentially" tiny and very much in line 0.10% gain in **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) compared to the S&P 500, might lead traders to believe not much is going on. But for those shareholders in Apple, today was actually quite significant. Apple had its first quarterly ex-dividend since 1995. And with a payout of $2.65 per share, it's a rather big deal. 

  

Depending on one's quote vendor, the ex-dividend event may have gone unnoticed. For instance, looking at two different platforms today, one shows AAPL up 0.10% or about 0.60 at 620.55. However, looking at another service for quotes and a gain of 3.34 points properly reflects the share price adjusted for the payout to stockholders owning the name before last night's close of 619.86 to 2.65 or 617.21. 

  

So, how might the ex-date impact option traders? The big story and definitely worth remembering for future ex-dividend payouts is if you own in-the-money calls in AAPL in front of the event. While a deep call may act like stock, when it comes to dividend treatment, the call holder forfeits his or her participation. Thus on lazy summery day like Thursday where shares of AAPL are treating deep call positions to the slightest of gains of 0.10%, those traders that smartly converted their calls into long stock are taking in a much heftier 0.55%.

  

Looking at Apple's board, the company's first declaration (after 17 years) managed to find a good deal of traders long deep calls with put values less than the payout, unwilling or more likely in this case, forgetting to exercise those contracts. Two glaring examples of money left on the table are the much smaller but still hefty residing open interest of more than 1,000 regular August 500 calls and 2,700 of the August 550 calls with same-strike put values of $0.13 and $0.26 as of last night. Why's that last feature important, you ask? 

  

Ultimately, when you're converting the long call into stock in order to take in the dividend, the trader is affecting a buy-write or synthetically selling a put by virtue of selling out the long call to acquire long stock. Thus, you should only be willing to perform this positional conversion if the dividend is juicier than the actual listed put, otherwise you'd be better off just selling a naked put. Given a payout of $2.65 versus $0.13 or $0.26, traders that failed to make this conversion effectively gave the other trader as close to a free lunch on Wall Street as you're likely to see.

Last week we received a timely reminder that stocks don't always go up in a straight line, with the Nasdaq composite being particularly hard hit.




Options are a fantastic tool that can not only achieve outsize returns, but can also help protect against sharp downward moves.


A put option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain underlying asset at the strike price on or before expiration.


Options Are Like Buying Insurance
---------------------------------


For this right, the buyer of the put option pays a premium to the option seller. Think of it like buying insurance against your house burning down.


You as the homeowner pay the insurance premium and the options seller is like the insurance company.


Owning a put option gives the owner the right to sell their stock at a certain price, no matter how low it goes. The downside is protected while the investor still gets to benefit in the upside.


Options on the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) are highly liquid and provide a great way to protect a portfolio of tech stocks.



Let's take the Oct. 16-expiring put with a 290 strike price as an example. This option contract was trading for around $9.50 on Wednesday.


As the [market sold off](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/us-stock-market-news-us-markets-today/), this option skyrocketed in value to as high as $26.


Next time the market is looking extended and you want to protect some of those gains, think about buying some insurance via put options.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

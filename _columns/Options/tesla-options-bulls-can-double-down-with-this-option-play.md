Tesla stock continues to be a popular stock and the latest pullback proved to be a buying opportunity.




On Monday, **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was up significantly after bouncing right near the 21-day moving average line. A few weeks ago, we looked at an [option trade on Tesla stock called a bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tesla-stock-option-trade-may-offer-74-percent-return-in-stock-market/).


For that trade we sold an Aug. 21 1,000 put and bought a 990 put for a net price of $4.25. That spread now trades around 25 cents and can be closed for a very healthy profit.


Traders that are still bullish on Tesla stock could repeat the process and sell the Aug. 21 1,300 put and buy the 1,290 put.


That spread traded around $1.65 Monday with risk of $8.35 for a potential 19.76% return if Tesla stock stays above 1,300 for the next three weeks.



If Tesla stock closes below 1,290 on Aug. 21, the trade would lose $835.


This is where an options spread has an advantage over uncovered strategies. With a bull put spread, you always know the worst-case scenario even if the stock drops significantly.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Yoga-inspired athletics attire specialist **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is back on top the IBD 50 and stretching higher after several weeks of what I'll call technical downward dog price action. Despite the ranking, can a relatively old dog with its hefty weekly base count, albeit a decent-sized correction of about 31%, lead the broader market higher into a firmer and toned down rally of intermediate longevity?

  

Personally, I'm not a fan. That's particularly so after a nice run of about 22% with nary a base present and overhead resistance now entering the picture.

  

Nonetheless, given Monday's latest buoyant spending data and high end products like **Apple**'s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) offerings or **Tiffany's** ([TIF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIF)) guidance last week suggesting demand for discretionary goods (though "iAm" sure some disagree) is ever-present and strong; if I were a bull, I'd look to defray some of the risk with a modified bullish butterfly.

  

Unlike a regular long call butterfly with its equal-distant bull call spread and bear call spread which share a common sold strike, modified versions can open up or ratchet down risk by making the upper bear call spread either wider or tighter than the lower strike bull call vertical.

  

When dealing with growth stocks, maybe even one where we believe the upside to be limited, by tightening the bearish vertical the trader has the positional advantage over a regular fly by always maintaining a profit on the upside above the uppermost protective call.

  

This type of modified butterfly which I refer to as a "closed wing" version runs in stark contrast to the modified called a "broken wing" butterfly. In that position, the bear spread is wider than the bull spread. As much, the position takes on substantial risk above the uppermost protective strike; though the trader stands to do much better than either the closed wing or classic butterfly if shares manage to cooperate perfectly and land graciously at the short middle strike at expiration. 

  

Shown above is a 1x September 55 / 60 / 62.5 call "closed wing" butterfly. With shares near 55.25, the combination fetches about $1.50 per spread. Below 55, the trader at expiration would forfeit the entire debit. At the sweet spot of 60, the position is worth $3.50 as the bull call expands to $5.00, the sold 60 / 62.5 bear spread goes out worthless and it cost the trader $1.50 to enter.

  

And above 62.50, which would put LULU within a couple percentage points of its all-time-highs, this modified keeps a profit of $1.00 or $100 per spread despite shares moving more aggressively than expected. This allowance is made possible as the closed wing makes $5.00 on the bull, loses -$2.50 on the bear and factors in the less-steamed up price of admission of $1.50.

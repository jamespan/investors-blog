The S&P 500 is in correction mode with the recommended [stock market exposure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-dow-jones-nasdaq-sp500-small-caps-tariffs/) sitting at 0%-20%. One way to reduce your exposure is to selectively add some bearish option trades to your portfolio. And a possible stock for that might be **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)), which has been in a downtrend trend since late January and shows declining relative strength.


The stock is currently below its 21-day exponential, 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Both the 21-day and 50-day are trending downward. If PayPal continues to move lower, a bear put spread would be the best way to trade it.




A bear put spread is a debit spread, meaning investors need to pay the premium in order to open the trade. On PayPal, traders can set up a bear put spread using the 65 strike as the long put and the 60 strike as the short put for the May 16 expiration.


This trade would cost around $165 per contract with a maximum potential gain of $335. To achieve the maximum profit, this trade would need PayPal stock to drop about a further 11% between now and expiration on May 16.


Breakeven Point At 63.35
------------------------


The breakeven point for the bear put spread stands at 63.35, calculated as 65 less the $1.65 option premium per contract. If PayPal stock drops early in the trade it may be possible to make a profit at slightly higher prices.


At expiration, if PayPal stock is trading above 65, the entire spread would end up being worthless. Thus, the trade loses 100% or $165. A stop loss could be set at 50% of the premium paid, for a deficit of around $82.


This bearish position means traders who see PayPal stock moving higher should not enter this trade. 


Also, the trade starts with a delta of -12. That means the exposure is roughly equivalent to being short 12 shares of PayPal stock. This [long straddle trade](https://www.investors.com/research/options/amd-stock-options-trading-straddle/) worked well on **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) and can be closed for a healthy profit.


**PayPal Stock Rankings**
-------------------------


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), PayPal stock ranks No. 17 in its group. Further, it has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 63, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 78 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 40.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Stock traders who follow CAN SLIM sometimes experience the aggravation of being stopped out of a position just before the stock rebounds and moves higher. Buying call options can sometimes change the dynamics of these frustrating situations. If planned properly, buying call options can limit risk to the 8% loss-cutting rule and, at the same time, keep you in a position after a stock trader would be stopped out. There are, of course, tradeoffs.

  

This article first discusses how buying calls can be tailored to CAN SLIM risk limits and the advantages and disadvantages of doing so. Second, a real stock recently highlighted in the Big Picture column is discussed.

  

**CALL OPTIONS EXPLAINED**

  

Call options are contracts that give owners the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price of the call until the expiration date. For example, with XYZ stock trading at $48, consider an XYZ May 50 Call option that is trading at $4 per share. For a cost of $4 per share plus commissions, this call gives its owner the right to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 per share at any time until the expiration date in May. Monthly options typically expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the month.

  

Should an investor buy this call option instead of buying the stock? Not necessarily; there are advantages and disadvantages to both.

  

**BUYING A STOCK VS. BUYING A CALL**

  

The buyer of XYZ stock must invest $50 per share. If CAN SLIM guidelines are followed, the risk is being stopped out at any time at $46 for a loss of $4 per share, or 8% of the cost of $50. There is also the additional risk that a downside gap opening below $46 could increase the loss above the 8% targeted limit.

  

In contrast to buying the stock, the buyer of the XYZ May 50 Call pays $4 per share when purchasing the call, and that is the maximum risk. No matter how quickly or how far XYZ stock might fall, the risk of buying a call is limited to the price paid plus commissions. An additional benefit is that, should XYZ stock fall to $46 prior to the May expiration date, the call option, and the right it contains, will still be in place should the stock price resume its advance.

  

The disadvantage of buying the call is the higher breakeven stock price at expiration. A 50 Call option purchased for $4 per share breaks even at $54 at expiration. Thus, if the stock price rises to $60 at option expiration, the purchaser of stock at $50 would make $10, while the purchaser of the 50 Call at $4 would make $6.

  

**Current Example: LNKD**

  

LinkedIn gained attention in [The Big Picture column by Paul Whitfield on Jan. 11](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/011013-640166-stocks-shake-free-of-recent-sideways-trade.htm). The social networking platform for professionals gapped up and gained 4.38 to 118.04 on Jan. 10 in volume 57% above average. LinkedIn "cleared a 116.97 buy point in a cup with handle. The base, which formed adjacent to an earlier base, is still first stage," the column said. 

  

If you believe that LNKD's upside breakout is a buying opportunity, the stock's price action over the last eight months might motivate you to consider buying call options instead of buying the stock.

  

Since April, LNKD has had a number of price declines that exceeded 8%. From May 4 to June 4, LNKD declined 22% from 117.30 to 91.51 before rallying back to 123 on Sept 14. During the summer, the stock also suffered a decline from 108 to 94. And after hitting 125 in September, LNKD declined to 94 again before building its recent basing pattern.

  

Had an investor purchased an August 2012 95 Call for 7.00 back in February of 2012 when LNKD rose above 90 for the first time, the call would have limited risk to approximately 8%, and it would have made it possible for the investor to stay in the position through the tumultuous summer and realize a profit on the call at expiration in August.

  

With LNKD trading at 118.40 at noon on Jan. 11, the LNKD August 130 Call was offered at 9.10 per share, which is approximately 8% of 118.50. This call has a breakeven stock price of $139.10 (strike price of 130 + cost of the call of 9.10 = 139.10), so the stock price must rise to this point just to break even. Above the break-even price at expiration, however, the call option participates dollar for dollar in any stock price rise. Given that risk is limited to the cost of the call, an investor willing to risk this amount might prefer the staying power of a call position in this volatile stock over buying the stock.

  

**Summary**

  

By focusing on the amount an investor is willing to risk, call options can be chosen so that two goals can be met. First, risk can be absolutely limited to the maximum amount desired, and, second, the risk of being prematurely stopped out can be avoided. The negatives are (1) buying a call has a higher breakeven point than buying stock and (2) dollar profits from a call are less than from stock if the stock price advances in a short period of time.

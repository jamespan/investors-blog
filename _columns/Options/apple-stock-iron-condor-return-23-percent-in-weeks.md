Iron condors can produce a return on stocks that stay within a specified range over the trade period.




This can be a welcome change for buy-and-hold investors who are reliant on markets always going up.


Today, we're going to look at an example with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock.


AAPL is currently showing elevated implied volatility, with an I.V. reading of 36%. That is higher than 91% of all other readings in the last 12 months.


An iron condor can be set up via a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction.


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the June 17 expiry, we could sell the 125 put and buy the 120 put. That spread could be sold Wednesday for around $0.50.


Then, the bear call spread could be placed by selling the 155 call and buying the 160 call. This spread could be sold Wednesday for around $0.45.


Trade Offers A $95 Premium
--------------------------


In total the iron condor will generate around $0.95 per stock in premium, or $95 for a 100-share block.


The profit zone ranges between 124.05 and 155.95. This can calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


Because both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5-0.95 x 100 = $405.


Therefore, if we take the premium ($95) divided by the maximum risk ($405), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 23%.


If price action stabilizes, then iron condors will work well. However, if Apple stock continues to bounce around, the trade will suffer losses.


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $95 so we could set a stop loss at 1.5 times the premium, or around $143.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Apple stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 77, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 90 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 65.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

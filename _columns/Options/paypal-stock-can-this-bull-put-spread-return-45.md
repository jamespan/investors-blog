**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) has shown solid action in the last few days since the stock crossed back above its 50-day moving average. The action may be partially fueled by PayPal's move into Bitcoin transactions. The technical action sets PayPal stock up for a potential bull put spread.




Bullish PayPal Stock Option Trade
---------------------------------


PayPal is a highly rated stock with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 98, an EPS Rating of 99 and an RS Rating of 89. The [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/) for PYPL stock has improved in the last week, and the stock is also showing a positive MACD cross. It's also a half position on [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


With a solid technical and fundamental outlook, it could be worth looking at an option strategy known as a bull put spread on PayPal stock.


A bull put spread is a defined-risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Aggressive traders could look to place the bull put spread just below the current stock price.


Traders who think PYPL stock will not drop below a price of 200 could look to sell a Dec. 18 200 put and buy a 195 put with the same expiration.


As of yesterday, this spread was trading for around $1.55, which means a trader selling this spread would receive $155 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $345.


That represents a potential 44.9% return on risk in 22 days as long as PayPal stock remains above 200.


Managing Risk For The Trade
---------------------------


If PYPL stock closes below 195 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $345 per contract. You get that number by taking the difference in the strike prices and subtracting the option premium collected.


In terms of risk management, I would close the trade if PayPal stock broke through the short put strike at 200.


Another good rule of thumb is to take profits if 50% of the return potential has been achieved in less than 50% of the time.


In other words, if the trade is showing a profit of around $75 before Dec. 6, we could take profits early.


PayPal does not report earnings until Dec. 1, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.

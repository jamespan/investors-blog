It is never too soon to think about year-end tax issues. Imagine that you have a loss on a stock position and that you would like to recognize the loss this year. However, you would also like to hold the stock because you believe it has excellent long-term prospects.  
   
Tax rules concerning what you can and cannot do before a tax loss is allowable are detailed in the pamphlet "Taxes and Investing for the Individual Investor" by the accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP. This publication is available online at no charge at [www.cboe.com](http://www.cboe.com). (Search for Taxes and Investing) You should also consult a tax professional to discuss your specific situation.   
   
If you want to recognize a stock loss for tax purposes, the essential rule is that you cannot buy that stock or an equivalent position within 30 days of the sale for tax purposes. Furthermore, "30 days" includes both 30 days before the stock is sold and 30 days after the stock is sold.   
   
There are three ways to comply with the 30-day rule:  
   
1. Sell shares on December 28. Wait 31 days. Repurchase the shares.  
The problem with this approach is that you have no position for 31 days. If the price falls, that is good; but if the price rises, that is bad.  
   
2. Buy shares to double your current position on November 27, wait 31 days until December 28, and then sell your current position. The problem with this approach is that risk is doubled. If the stock price rises, that is good; but if it falls, that is bad.   
   
3. Instead of buying shares — as in #2 above — buy a 90-day call. On November 27 (Thanksgiving), buy one call for each 100 shares you own. 31 days later, on December 28 (Christmas), sell your shares and recognize the tax loss this year. 31 days later, on January 28 (Super Bowl), buy shares to replace your original position and sell the call.   
   
Buying a call is "an equivalent position" in the eyes of the IRS and, therefore, must comply with the 30-days-before and 30-days-after rules. A call, however, requires substantially less investment and involves substantially less risk than buying an equal number of shares.

A late follow-through day in hand, a fearful VIX still suggesting bumps ahead and few growth stocks up to speed, all point to suspect conditions. Yet, if you're going to give what amounts to as a higher low double bottom in the S&P 500 off key support by way of the 1100 level, this strategist can't blame one for trying. 

  

Looking at the board in the **S&P 500 ETF**  ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) for ways to position, September puts have been very active with a handful of out-of-the money strikes trading 40,000 â€” 50,000 contracts apiece. With substantially large open interest accompanying the always fast-paced action in the market's most actively traded option product, your guess is as good as and maybe better than mine. 

  

Topping the heavy trading, the September 110 put has seen volume of more than 55,000 compared to open interest of 400,000. The put is trading for $2.20 per contract on well bid, but respectively bid implieds of about 42% which reflect the action of the last few weeks. 

  

With 1100 in the S&P 500 being the recent low and Tuesday a confirmation of higher prices, a naked seller of the put is making the expiration bet the technical level will hold while giving themselves a bit of wiggle room with a breakeven of 107.80. If the trader is willing to accept an assignment, the sale is referred to as a targeted purchase.

  

The problem with targeted purchases is when it occurs during a downdraft, particularly volatile ones like those, which we've seen in the last couple weeks. What seems like a good idea at the time becomes prone to a less optimistic revision but one, which could result in nasty losses before action to clean up the position is available.

  

That all said and like I've expressed in recent days, the vertical position is an alternative strategy to consider. The limited-risk strategy which in this instance would purchase a further out-of-the money put for protection allows the trader the peace of mind of knowing that if push comes to shove and 107.8 doesn't look as attractive down the road, he or she will at least have a firm, undeniable grip on their risk. Depending on just how much risk one is willing to assume i.e. purchased strike, will determine a new breakeven...or what we see as still being a targeted purchase but one built with a bit more Street smarts.

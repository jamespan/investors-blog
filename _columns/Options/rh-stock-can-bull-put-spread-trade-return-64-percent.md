Luxury home furnishings retailer **RH** ([RH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RH)) was Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/), so let's take a look at a potential option trade.




RH stock has a Composite Rating of 94, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 90 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96, so all looks good there.


Looking at the chart, the stock is holding nicely above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) around 366. So, it might make sense to place a bull put spread around that area with a tight stop loss given the market is a bit volatile at the moment.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an [out-of-the-money put](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish RH Stock Option Trade**
---------------------------------


Traders who think RH stock will not drop below 365 could look to sell a Dec. 18-expiration 360 monthly put and buy a December 350 put.


On Tuesday, this spread was trading for around $3.90. This means a trader selling this spread would receive $390 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $610.


That represents a 64% return on risk between now and Dec. 18 as long as RH stock remains above 360.


If RH stock closes below 350 on the expiration date, then the trade loses the full $610.


Manage Risk
-----------



The break-even point for the bull put spread is 356.10, which is calculated as 360 less the 3.90 option premium per contract.


If RH's stock price drops below 360, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Keeping position size small for a while longer might also be a good idea given the [current state of the market](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

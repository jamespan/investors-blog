IBD 50 constituent **World Fuel Service**  ([INT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INT)) was atop the unusual contract list for component stocks on Thursday. Call and put volume of nearly 3,300 spiked above the energy outfit's lowly and typical 150 contracts. Driving the action, earnings this evening found one large trader establishing a slightly out-of-the-money March 45 put position for $0.60 on 1,000 contracts. 

  

What we can't tell definitively is whether the put was the result of customer order flow looking to buy protection against an existing position such as long stock, someone seeking a bearish reaction in shares or possibly a trader interested in a targeted purchase a.k.a. a short put sale.

  

Obscuring the interpretation, while implied volatility picked up on the session, the move may have been due to a fairly equal number of close-to-the-money March 50 calls, which also traded. That activity was the easy-to-see result of persistent retail order flow over the course of the session. Relative to open interest of just 300 contracts and knowing with a fair degree of confidence this type of selling would be very much out of the ordinary, we can assume opening buyers ruled the day.

  

What tomorrow holds for those bulls we can't be certain. But as it stands, following the company's mixed results and shares trading mostly flat relative to the close, we can predict with more accurate authority a trader purchasing the March 50 call for about $1.35 is likely to see a loss of about $0.60 per contract based on a volatility crush and all else being equal. How can we be so sure? As experienced option traders realize, some charts and patterns just work more predictably than others.

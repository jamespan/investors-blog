It's common knowledge amongst growth traders the bulk of those high-flying stocks, once they stumble, go on to lose in the vicinity of 70% of their market capitalizations. Though most also never go on to reach those prior levels of optimism, most do stick around for a while. Some even remain in the public eye and continue to be strong trading vehicles for option traders. **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) looks to be of that caliber of stock. 

  

Shares of NFLX recently confirmed the historical average of what happens when growth stumbles or falters altogether. Amidst a backlash of angry customers cancelling memberships on a price hike by the company and an earnings-related fallout, the stock shed some 75% at its recent lows in a span of just more than three months.

  

Secondly, despite competitive risks, the outfit is still the world's largest provider of streaming entertainment. And though like many others before me, I plan on cutting out my monthly combo deal of online and mail based viewing to just the former; I do like Netflix as a product and will continue being a customer. 

  

As for trading opportunities, Netflix still looks like a winner for option traders. With shares hovering in the low 80s, volatility in the mid double digits and option liquidity, quite simply excellent, there are plenty of spread opportunities that can be executed with relative ease and little slippage. 

  

  

One such spread that caught our eye, though I'm not sure if it rightfully accounts for late-to-cut subscribers like myself, is the December 75 / 85 bull spread using puts. Priced for about $4.35 with shares at 83.35, our illustrated two lot maintains an expiration breakeven of 80.65, keeps the risk contained to $5.65 no matter any potential flaws in our analysis and obviously doesn't need any upside surprises in order to take advantage of a potential new paradigm.

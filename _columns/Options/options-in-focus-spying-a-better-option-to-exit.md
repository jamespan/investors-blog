Seventeen days into the market's rally attempt and what constitutes a very, very late follow-through day or FTD signaled in the broader averages Tuesday. Of course, maybe November 30th represented an early Day 3 FTD with today merely acting as a confirmation of sorts? Or maybe it's simply a more gracious bear donning some bullish threads today as part of a classic bear market rally? 

  

As we admitted too yesterday, it's our humble opinion the market has become increasingly difficult to predict directionally by rules that worked in days gone by. What still works the same within the investment game is managing one's risk, whether on the right side of the action or otherwise. And as discussed Monday, to stay ahead in this game of investing while allowing for a bit of margin of error to creep into our price charts, limited risk option spreads are a means to that end.

  

  

Unfortunately our vehicle of choice to illustrate by example looks a little bit out of touch with Tuesday's closing market enthusiasm. Looking at Monday's outlined risk graph of a "risk vertical" or a coined "capped bearish risk reversal" and the position is down $200 on paper versus a max loss of $525. 

  

What will tomorrow bring? I have less of a clue these days, but for the time being by tethering losses to a managed stop loss exit of 125.37, which lines up with where the max pain would begin to exist at expiration but only result in about half that amount in the immediate future, that sounds about right in a mad and sometimes very ho-ho-hopeful market.

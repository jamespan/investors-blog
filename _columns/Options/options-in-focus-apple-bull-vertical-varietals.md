The vertical spread is about as simple of a two-legged spread as you're going to find. Using the same contract month, a trader purchases one strike and sells another. If you're a bull, the lower strike is bought and the higher strike is sold. For bears and the other side of the bull position, it's the reverse, plain and simple and it's the same using all calls or all puts. 

  

The vertical is also an incredibly versatile spread by design. Most often thought of as a directional spread which flattens out a trader's vega or implied volatility risk; the position can actually look quite a bit different depending on how the strikes are positioned in relation to stock and how close to expiration the vertical is. The numerous variations of strike manipulation and time can allow a trader to open up, cut down drastically or even come close to eliminating various Greek risks such as vega, theta and delta. 

  

  

To illustrate, let's compare a four-lot bull put spread to a nine-lot bull call spread in IBD 50 constituent and market heavyweight **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) using the July contracts. The two bull verticals share a couple common traits, they're both out-of-the-money and the dollar risk in each is roughly $3,000. But it's the variation in positioning relative to shares and the contract sizing, which make these two bullish spreads quite different with regards to when and how much in profits are possible. 

  

Were shares to do nothing between now and expiration, the bull put spread trader would be perfectly happy as they'll take in their maximum profit. In fact, they shouldn't mind if AAPL shares actually dropped a handful of percentage points. As long as the 550 strike remains out-of-the-money, at expiration they'd still take in their full profit potential of $1,000 for the four-lot spread. 

  

On the other hand, the out-of-the-money bull call spread has the same dollar risk at stake but its debit of roughly $2,900 or $3.22 per spread needs shares of AAPL to lift above 600 or risk losing the entire enchilada or umm, apple. Needing a stock to rise a handful of percentage points to make money is very different set of bullish circumstances than only requiring that shares don't drop below a certain level. The upside of course or what should be obvious in comparing the two verticals is if Apple sees a good size bullish move, the latter call strategy will be the much meatier or umm, juicer option…pardon the pun.

With the stock market [losing key levels on Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-stock-market-loses-key-level-ahead-of-fed-meeting-jerome-powell-this-hot-group-struggles/), it could be a good time to look for bearish option opportunities. **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) has really struggled in recent months with the stock failing to get back above [key moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). So, this column highlights a bear put spread strategy in TGT stock.




TGT stock has collapsed as much as 27% in the last six months. The [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/) has sunk from 58 six months ago to 19 (with 99 being best), according to MarketSmith.


In a bear put spread, this debit spread means that we need to pay the premium in order to open the trade.


On TGT stock, a trader could set up a bear put spread using the 110 strike price as the long put and the 105 strike as the short put for the Jan. 19 expiration.


This trade would cost around $100 per contract, based on recent trading. The maximum potential gain stands at $400.


**TGT Stock: Profit From Another Slide**
----------------------------------------


To achieve the maximum profit, this trade would need TGT stock to drop 12% between now and expiration on Jan. 19, 2024.


The break-even point for the bear put spread: 109, which is calculated as 110 less the $1 option premium per contract. 


If TGT stock drops early in the trade, it may be possible to make a profit at slightly higher prices.



At expiration, if TGT stock is trading above 110, the entire spread would expire worthless. So, the trade would lose 100% or $100.


For a trade like this, I wouldn't bother with a stop loss. Either the trade works or it doesn't, so I would trade an appropriate position size in case I suffered the full 100% loss. Alternatively, you could set a stop loss at 50% of the premium paid.


As this is a bearish position, traders who think TGT stock could move higher from here should not enter this trade.

**Weakening Ratings**
---------------------

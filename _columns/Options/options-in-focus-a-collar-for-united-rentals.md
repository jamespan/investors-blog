Tuesday's higher and well-above average volume gain in **United Rentals Inc** ([URI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=URI)), all but confirmed Monday's breakout in shares to fresh ten-plus year highs out of a five-week flat base pattern. And then came Wednesday. 

  

Along with general unrest and a third go at breaking 1400 level support in the S&P 500, shares of URI fell 3.3% on the session to finish at 43.39. Relative to the pattern breakout of 44.22, shares are still less than 2% below the textbook buy point and as they say at IBD, within buying range. But quick and undesirable turnarounds or price assaults through what should be support are also said to warrant a bit more caution. 

  

Given the broader market's lengthy six month run and somewhat shaky position around 1400, caution can be given a stronger basis if bulls choose to establish a limited risk position such as a married put or collar. The former uses a 1:1 ratio of stock and long put to define a traders downside risk to: Stock Price + Put Premium — Strike Price.

  

  

The collar strategy and currently the one we see as the smarter spread, reduces the cost of the married put by selling a call. In effect, this also caps a trader's upside potential. However, barring strong price gaps, traders can also look to roll their spread up and continue to profit from a rally in shares, albeit at a reduced return versus an investor simply long the stock. 

  

With one-point strike prices and "okay" liquidity provision, traders using a collar can expect to pay up slightly rather than think fair value / mid-market pricing is going to do the trick. That said and looking above at an illustrated 5x April 41 / 45 collar—that's still a nifty trick to consider versus the one all too reliant on mental stops and sometimes damaging mob psychology which make those targeted exits a bit more slippery than wanted.

With two hours left in Wednesday's session, a widely anticipated "yes" vote from Greece's parliament confirmed and investors apparently at ease with the upcoming passing of QE2, what could possibly go wrong? The answer appears to be, "not a whole lot" as evidenced by S&P 500's third day of percentage gains and a comfortably confident CBOE Volatility index bordering on complacency. 

  

The market's most notorious sentiment gauge has quickly worked its way from brief and overly fearful three-month highs stretched well above its 10-day simple moving average less than two weeks back, to once again trading in its lateral trading range of a couple months. 

  

At a level of 17.5% off about 8.5% on the day, the VIX's price for protection has grown quickly much cheaper. In fact, with the relationship of the VIX versus its short-term moving average kinda stretchy at 12.5% compared to our typical 15% guideline, prices as mentioned are comfortably confident. But as a contrary indicator tool, isn't necessarily a good thing.

  

Sure, some of this optimism might have to do with the discounting phenomenon of investors trying to get ahead of other investors wise to premium collection in front of the upcoming long holiday weekend, which unofficially extends from Friday morning until next Tuesday. In this day and age of aggressive trade practices, Wednesday is probably the new late Thursday to many traders looking for an edge to sell some additional time decay or theta, whether the end result actually amounts to consistent profits or not.

  

That all said and personally being more of the pragmatic and simple market pulse-taking kind of market observer, while I like to hope for the best from the market, the decision to remain an option hedge hog rather than an overt bull makes sense and likely cents at this stage in the game.

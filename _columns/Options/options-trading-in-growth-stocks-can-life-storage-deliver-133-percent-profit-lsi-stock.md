**Life Storage** ([LSI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LSI)) jumped past a new [flat base and its entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/) of 140.05, part of a [base-on-base formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/five-ways-to-spot-the-bullish-base-on-base-stock-pattern/). This powerful chart pattern has spawned big winners in the past. In options trading, growth investors can benefit from breakouts, too.




LSI stock also deserves attention as the [IBD 50 Stocks To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-50-growth-stocks-to-watch/) pick for Monday.


Let's assume an investor spies a price target for LSI stock of 155. One way to take advantage of that price? Use options and trade a bull call spread. A bull call spread is a defined risk trade, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


To set up the bull call spread in options trading, simply buy a call and then sell a further out-of-the-money call.


Options Trading: Why Consider The Bull Call Spread?
---------------------------------------------------



Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade. But that move also limits the upside.


Going out to March expiration, a 150-strike call option was trading around $4 Tuesday. The 155 call hovered near $2.50.


Buying the 150 call and selling the 155 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $150 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100), and the maximum potential profit would be $350 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy in options trading. So, if LSI stock closes below 150 on March 18, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $150 premium paid.


Your potential gains also get capped above 155. So no matter how high LSI stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $350.


Managing The Trade
------------------



If the spread dropped from $150 to $75, or if the stock dropped below 130, I would consider closing early for a loss.


Life Storage likely will report quarterly earnings in early February. So earnings risk exists with this trade unless a trader closes it before then.


More aggressive players in options trading may prefer just to buy the 150-strike call. A long call trade has unlimited upside potential.


LSI is ranked number three in its group and it has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 91 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 95.


LSI stock is sitting above rising 21-, 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

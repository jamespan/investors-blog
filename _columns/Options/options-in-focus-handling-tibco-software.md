On a Monday which found the broader market under pressure for nearly the entire session, **Tibco Software** ([TIBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIBX)) was spied making a constructive statement about handling its price chart in good form. On above average volume and no news to speak of, shares of TIBX broke out of a handle consolidation within a well-shaped but deep first stage cup base. 

  

For option traders looking to position, Tibco sports just "okay and slightly meager liquidity" with rather consistent $0.10 to $0.15 wide near-the-money quotes in both its calls and puts. The slightly better news is strike distances are tight at one point and decent open interest through January does suggest that bulls, bears and even hedgehogs can look to those markets for some help with positioning. Still, being realistic about what can and won't be filled is a definite consideration in this kind of product. 

  

One popular contract today was the at-the-money December 30 call. Volume of nearly 800 contracts almost double the existing count of 434 and suggests some opening of positions. For traders sympathetic towards today's handle breakout, with shares closing at 29.74 and just narrowly above the proper buy point of 29.66, a naked long call priced at $1.75 would require a max move of around 12% by expiration in order to double in value. Prior to that day and the sooner the better as far as this strategist is concerned; quicker similar profits due to the option still possibly maintaining a bit of extrinsic or time value, could be realized. 

  

Implieds were bid up today but remain just off range lows of the past couple months and appear mostly fair to cheap relative to statistical volatility. Both ways of looking at the value of an option hint at favoring a long call strategy like with the December 30s. However, the reality of making a directional decision on those factors doesn't hold water for very long either. In the end or one's holding period; both delta or directional risk and theta or time decay are going to matter a whole lot more to whether this type bull is soon handling nice profits or otherwise.

The term "value" can be highly subjective when it comes to investing. In the world of options trading some of that determination can be increased in its authority, if we see a situation that sports relative value when comparing one contract to surrounding contracts. Typically, traders using calculated values from a trading platform of their choice will simply notice the implied volatility of the contract, either a call or put, in question, is priced well below the other nearby options. 

  

An alternative means to recognizing this kind of value can be accomplished by lining up synthetic markets. For instance, a trader can combine a call with stock to form a synthetic put. This synthetic put can then be compared to the market of the natural or real listed put contract. When the call market is looked at from this angle and is priced cheap compared to the real put, there's a good but not guaranteed case for having uncovered relative value. Why would or how could this disparity occur? Typically, it's one of two factors or possibly both.

  

For one, traders might be seeing some temporary order flow in a less liquid name which doesn't have much in the way of customer paper and / or demand market makers attention normally. As much, the anomaly might be good for a couple contracts with which a trader can hedge using other fair priced options. However, while market makers are obliged to honor their other quoted calls and puts with some minimum amount of liquidity provision before they change the quotes in order to not get picked off further, don't expect any favors or second helpings.

  

Secondarily and when it comes to a call looking cheap in relation to its synthetic equivalent of the same strike and other surrounding calls; a trader could be looking at a hard-to-borrow situation. When shares are "HTB" or impossible to short, calls can quite often trade at a theoretical discount to puts as the natural hedge to reduce delta or directional risk is with short stock. 

  

When shares to short can't be located by one's broker, traders wishing to get long or short deltas without this meddlesome restriction will trade long puts in conjunction with long stock. Depending on their directional outlook or fresh positioning, the trader can adjust the ratio of long stock by selling inventory or accumulating more without the same problems encountered by the long call trader subsequently needing to hedge. That said, what looks cheap may prove more costly than one might think down the road if not carefully scrutinized in the present and before any positioning might occur.

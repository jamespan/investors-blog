Snap stock, a member of the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com), is sitting above its rising 21-, 50- and 200-day moving averages.




Implied volatility for **Snap** ([SNAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNAP)) is 46% which is the lowest level we have seen in the last 12 months. That means options are cheap compared to the previous 12 months.


When that occurs, it is better to be a net buyer of options rather than a seller.


One way to trade Snap stock from the long side with defined risk is with an option strategy known as a bull call spread.


Create a bull call spread by buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Snap Stock: Bull Call Spread
----------------------------


Going out to August expiration, a 60-strike call option traded around $7.60 Monday. The 70 call price was around $3.30.



Buying the 60 call and selling the 70 call creates a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $430 for a block of SNAP shares (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). The maximum profit potential would be $570 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy. If Snap stock closes below 60 on August 20, the most the trade could lose is roughly the $430 premium paid.


Additionally, potential gains are also capped above 70. That means no matter how high Snap stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $670.


Gain Bullish Exposure
---------------------


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain bullish exposure to Snap stock using options.


If the spread dropped from $4.30 to $2.15, or if the stock dropped below 59, I would consider closing early for a loss. Otherwise, I would hold to expiry.

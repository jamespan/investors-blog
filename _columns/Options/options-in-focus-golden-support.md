Shares of mining outfit **Royal Gold**  ([RGLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RGLD)) was spied flirting with its 200-day simple moving average for a second session Thursday. But, is it golden support for bulls, pardon the pun? 

  

Looking to the option market for possible clues, total call and put activity today surged and with less than 45 minutes remaining stands at 6,200 contracts compared to its 50-day simple moving average daily rate of about 1,000. Of that, roughly 4,200 contracts were concentrated in the in-the-money January 70 put. 

  

Small prints around $5.00 per contract fulfilled about half of the volume while two larger block prints for $5.10 and spaced roughly 12 minutes apart account for the balance of the trading. So are the bears suggesting an actual move through the key long-term moving average and into the enemy turf of bulls? If they're opening buyers that could be the case, as there doesn't look to be any stock tied to the option. 

  

On the other hand, the existing open interest in the put is only slightly larger than today's trading with a figure of 5,300 contracts. Thus, a good portion of the activity could represent already positioned bears heading for the exits by selling "to close" the contract with potentially nice profits in hand given shares have tumbled in excess of 15% during the month of December. 

  

In the end, while we believe closing sellers have been driving the order flow, without knowing the particulars of when traders may have purchased the contract, if that's what they did in the first place, means we're doing our own sort of speculative mining for clues. And in this type situation, while every story has two sides to tell their version of things, with options and nary a definitive confirm in hand, simple endings are quite often harder to appreciate without a grain of salt or umm, a brick of gold.

Since discussing a bullish near-the-money vertical in IBD 100 component Priceline.com (PCLN) back on December 20 shares continued to work on making a multi-week flat base a bit more durable until today's breakout attempt. An illustrated January 420 / 440 call spread priced for $5.35 per spread is up about $3.50 mid market and nearing $9.00 with a couple hours still on the clock. 

  

With shares of PCLN around $427, the intrinsic value of the vertical is about $7.00 and its maximum profit of $14.65 [strike difference â€” premium] still far removed from today's gain. But and as previously written, with shares of PCLN at a critical price decision, this strategist wants to see what kind of adjustment might be available to afford a stronger position while its available. 

  

Due to the fact shares haven't made a dramatic percentage move yet and the amount of time taken to reach this key price area on the chart; after checking the option board for ideas, turning the vertical into a long call condor looks more attractive than the initially discussed but more finely-tuned precision play of a long butterfly or even its modified cousin.

  

  

The two all-call long condors which make the most sense and "cents" in terms of capturing a guaranteed credit and current technical picture are the 420/430-440/450 and 430/440-450/460. Depending on whether a trader wants to fade Wednesday's move to a certain degree or play a bit more optimistically but not be called a raging bull, would invariably be key factors in which spread to chose. Of course, traders could book profits, opt to sit on paper gains or some other strategy after careful deliberation. What do you think?

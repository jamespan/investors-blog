Microsoft stock is one of the strongest stocks in the market with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96 and an Earnings Per Rating of 95. As of Wednesday's close, **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) ranked No. 26 in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks.




Investors wanting leveraged exposure to Microsoft stock can do so via an option strategy called a long call.


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (strike price), up until a certain date (expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage. This can be both a good and a bad thing.


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of Microsoft stock, they would have to invest around $20,900 at the current price.

Instead, the investor could gain the same exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option. One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.


Microsoft Stock Call Option
---------------------------


If an investor were to buy one Microsoft 170 call option expiring in January 2021, they would only need to invest around $4,500 rather than $20,900. If Microsoft stock goes to $0, the investor loses only $4,500 while still maintaining a similar exposure to the gains.


The Microsoft 170 call option gives the investor the right to buy 100 Microsoft shares at 170 up until the expiration date.


The call option costs around $45.00 so the investor would need Microsoft stock to rise above 215 (strike price plus premium paid) in order to be profitable on the investment.



There is always a risk with trading on leverage like this. If Microsoft drops below $170 at expiry, the investor would lose 100% of the investment, which is the $4,500. An investor holding 100 shares on the other hand would lose around $3,900.


Buying a call option is just one of numerous possible option strategies, but it is a very easy one for investors to start with.


If MSFT stock dropped below the 50-day moving average, currently around 203, I would rethink the trade or close it early to avoid further losses.

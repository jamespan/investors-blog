Not all trades work out the way you would like. A few days ago, we looked at a **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) [option trade called a short straddle](https://www.investors.com/research/options/short-straddle-lulu-stock-generates-option-premium/). At the time, LULU stock was trading around 290. But then Lulu stock gapped up on news that it was [purchasing fitness company Mirror](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-stock-jumps-mirror-acquisition/). So what now?




Short Straddle On Lulu Stock Revisited
--------------------------------------


Remember, a short straddle involves selling an at-the-money put and an at-the-money call. Maximum profit occurs if the stock stays at the level of your strikes, in this example 290. When selling a short straddle, the last thing you want is a big move up or down right after your trade entry.


It's no surprise that the trade is down because of the jump in LULU stock, to the tune of $315. Traders selling the straddle received $2,250 in option premium. As of Wednesday, they would have to pay more than that to close the trade.

The upper break-even point was 312.40, the 22.50 premium plus the 290 strike. With LULU stock closing Wednesday at 308.62, the trade is still within the profit zone, but only just. And that's assuming it stays there until the July 17 expiration.


Where Do You Go From Here?
--------------------------


At this point, traders have a few choices:


1. Bail on the trade and take the loss. This would be the safest choice as the loss on the trade will get bigger if LULU stock continues to rally. Remember, this trade doesn't have a limit to the losses possible.


2. Stick with the trade and bail out if the loss reaches $450 or if the break-even price of 312.40 is reached. It surpassed that level intraday but hasn't closed above it yet.


3. Reposition the straddle at the current price of 310. This will reduce the profit potential in the trade by around $400 but will center the straddle again at the current price. That is assuming you think that LULU stock will stay at this level.


4. One final strategy is to use delta hedging. That is quite an advanced topic and not something we've covered here yet. With the trade currently showing a delta of -57, traders would buy a certain number of shares to reduce the delta to make the trade more neutral again. A gain in LULU stock would offset the loss on the option trade should it occur.


Not all trades work, unfortunately. The key with options, as with many trading strategies, is to cut losses quickly and avoid them turning into even bigger losses.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

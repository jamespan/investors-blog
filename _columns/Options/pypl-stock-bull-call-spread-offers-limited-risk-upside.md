**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) stock is a highly rated stock that recently bounced off the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) which also placed the stock in a [new buy area](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/stocks-near-a-buy-zone/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-paypal-stock-rebounds-support-servicenow-buy-point/).




Yesterday, call buyers outpaced put buyers by a ratio of 2-1 which could be seen as a bullish sign.


PYPL stock is rated number one in its group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 98 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 82. The stock is also sitting at number nine on the IBD Leaderboard.


PYPL stock reports earnings on Wednesday and traders wanting to take a bullish position could look at a bull call spread. A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside profit.


Going out to March expiration, a 270 strike call option was trading yesterday around $6.80 and the 280 call was around $4.80.


Buying the 270 call and selling the 280 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $200 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100) and the maximum profit potential would be $800 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if PYPL stock closes below 270 on March 19, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $200 premium paid.



Potential gains are also capped above 280, so no matter how PYPL stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $800.


PYPL Stock Bull Call Spread Offers Limited Risk Upside Exposure
---------------------------------------------------------------


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to PYPL stock using options.


In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $2.00 to $0.80 I would consider closing early for a loss. Otherwise I would hold it until expiration.


Another thing to watch for is the drop in implied volatility which invariably comes after earnings. This could negatively impact the price of the spread, even if the stock rises.


It is important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

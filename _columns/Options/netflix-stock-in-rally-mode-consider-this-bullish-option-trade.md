Pullbacks in Netflix stock have been great buying opportunities over the past few years, and a bullish option trade looks to take advantage of a rebound in the tech giant.




**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is green across the board at IBD with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 89.


Crossing above a 21-day moving average is generally a bullish sign. Netflix stock did just that on Tuesday.


One of my favorite bullish trades is a bull put spread.


Bull put spreads are defined risk trades that profit if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Netflix Stock: Bullish Option Trade
-----------------------------------


With Netflix stock closing at 509.64 yesterday, it makes sense to place the bull put spread around 460.


Selling a September 18 460 put and buying the 450 put would generate around $230 in premium based on yesterday's closing prices.



This trade offers a 30% return potential in one and a half months, provided Netflix stock closes above 460 at expiration.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $230 per contract with a maximum risk of $770.


The spread would achieve the maximum profit if Netflix stock closes above 460 on September 18. In this case, the entire spread would expire worthless allowing the premium seller to keep the $230 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if Netflix stock closes below 450 on September 18, which would see the premium seller lose $770 on the trade.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 457.70 which can be calculated as 460 less the $2.30 option premium per contract.


Setting A Stop Loss
-------------------


Looking at the chart, I would rethink or close the trade if Netflix stock closed back below the 21-day moving average.


Sticking to this stop loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.

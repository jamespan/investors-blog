**FedEx** ([FDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FDX)) is showing a series of higher highs and higher lows and looks poised for a breakout.




FedEx stock is also holding above its rising [21-day exponential](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) average and [50-day moving average.](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) However, it is showing so-so ratings, with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 86, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 86 and a [Relative Strength Rating](http://How The Relative Strength Rating Helps You Pick Growth Stocks https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 76.


FedEx stock is currently 8% below the 52-week high and 9% above the 50-day moving average. More importantly, the stock is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) with a 283.03 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


The stock also holds the No. 1 ranking in IBD's airfreight industry group.


Let's take a look at a bullish option trade on FDX stock known as a bull put spread.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Bullish FDX Stock Option Trade
------------------------------


Traders who think FedEx stock will not drop below 275 could look to sell an April 16-expiring put with a 275 strike price and buy an April 16 270-strike put.


On Friday, this spread was trading for around $1.60, which means a trader selling this spread would receive $160 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $340.


That represents a 47% return on risk between now and April 16 as long as FDX stock remains above 275.


If FedEx stock closes below 270 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $340.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 273.40, which is calculated as 275 less the $1.60 option premium per contract.


If the spread value rose from $1.60 to $3.20, I would look to close the trade early for a loss.


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 10, which means it is a similar exposure to owning 10 shares of FDX stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

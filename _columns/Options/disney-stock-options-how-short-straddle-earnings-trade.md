Last week, we looked at an options trade known as a short straddle. Specifically, we looked at this trade idea on **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)), which reported earnings Tuesday after the closing bell.




Whenever a company announces earnings, implied volatility drops through the floor. This is known as a volatility crush. This makes sense if you think about it, because a huge amount of uncertainty surrounding the announcement is now gone.


A trader that sells a [short straddle](https://www.investors.com/research/options/disney-stock-how-to-trade-options-in-disney-why-a-straddle-looks-enticing-during-earnings/) over earnings is hoping to profit from this volatility crush. The trade-off is that if the stock makes a big move, the trade might suffer losses because it is also a neutral option trade.


As a reminder, a short straddle involves selling a naked put and a naked call, usually right around where the stock is trading at the time.


Last week, Disney stock was trading around 107 and we looked at selling the 107 May 8 call for $4.26 and the 107 put for $3. This would generate a total of $726 per contract in option premium and give the trade break-even points of 99.74 and 114.26.


At the time, implied volatility for these options was around 57%, representing the large amount of nervousness surrounding the earnings release.


How Trade Worked With Disney Stock
----------------------------------


Now that Disney has announced earnings, let's take a look at how this trade worked out.


Disney stock traded Wednesday in a range between 98.86 and 105.27 and ended the day at $100.88. The May 8 107 call ended the day at around 12 cents and the 107 put ended at $6.19. Together that gives the straddle a value of $6.31.



As the initial straddle was sold for $7.26, the trade ended with a small profit of 95 cents, or $95 per contract.


However, at one point during the day when Disney stock was around 105, the straddle traded as low as $3.75. So, it was a win for the short-straddle sellers over the buyers in this instance.


We looked at this trade a few days out from earnings. If instead we had looked to sell the straddle the day before earnings and buy it back the day after, the trade would have been even more profitable.


Disney stock was trading around 101 right before the earnings announcement. The 101 straddle could have been sold for between $7 and $7.50 and closed the following day around $2.80.


Test Drive This Strategy
------------------------


It doesn't always work out this way of course, and sometimes a stock will make a huge move after earnings and that can result in big losses for straddle sellers.


Hopefully you learned something from this example and can also start working through your own earnings straddle examples. Try paper trading first, of course.


Some big name companies reporting earnings over the next week or so include **Bristol Myers Squibb** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)), **Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)), **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)).


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consider a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

With all the talk of few and far between proper bases and dizzying volatility that makes for some hard-to-handle deltas in most tickers these days; bulls may want to look at the **Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF**  ([GDX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GDX)) as one way to dig in.

  

On the technical side, GDX have been carving out an undercut high-level double bottom base on the weekly chart for the past nine-plus months. With the formation about 25% in depth and centered around its prior all-time highs set back in early 2008, there's even more to like regarding the prospects of a potential breakout into higher ground in the weeks and months ahead.

  

The buy point based on a mid pivot set back in April is 64.24. This week shares got as high as 64.05 on Monday before backing off and regrouping to close the week at 62.48 and a period of consolidation worthy of being called a handle.

  

Looking to GDX's options, penny increments, plenty of actual liquidity provision and single point strike distances allow traders to contemplate, as well as execute most any strategy one might come up, except maybe the exotic and rare "Triple Lindy."

  

For traders looking to dig or umm "dive" in with options, given the size of the pattern but also maybe not wishing to get too caught up in classic eye candy, which might prove a trap given the run Comex Gold has enjoyed; October looks like a spot to start. And as regular readers can likely guess, the vertical, which we personally see as a "gold standard" of sorts in this current wild volatility environment; sounds like a nice way to complete the package without getting too hooked on something which could be technical fool's gold.

**Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) is a defensive stock that has been holding up well during the recent market volatility. On the chart, PG stock shows clear upside resistance at 164 and on the downside, the 50-day moving average currently has risen back to 155.




Using an option strategy called a short strangle, we can sell call options at resistance and sell put options at support. By doing so, we can generate two separate lots of option income and achieve a profit on range bound stocks.


This is a risky trade because it involves the sale of naked options, so it is not recommended for beginners. 


The losses are potentially unlimited so always keep that in mind.


**PG Stock: Setting Up A Strangle In Options**
----------------------------------------------


Let's take a look at an example using PG stock.


Specifically, we'll look at a short strangle with a May 20 expiration date.



To set up a short strangle, traders could sell the 165 call and the 152.50 put. 


At the close of trading on Tuesday, the 165 call was trading around $1.55 and the 152.50 put was also trading for $1.55.


**Reward Vs. Risk**
-------------------



Selling these two options would generate $310 in premium with break-even points at 149.40 and 168.10.


PG is not due to report earnings for another three months, so there would be no earnings risk with this trade.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), PG stock ranks 2nd in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 88, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 72 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 88. Procter & Gamble recently cleared a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) and its 161.31 entry. Shares are trading just beneath that [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).


Selling strangles on range bound stocks is a popular trade for option traders, however it's important to be aware of the risks when trading naked options.


Always remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) stock had a monster day on Friday with the stock rallying 13% in nearly five times its average volume over the past 50 sessions. Shares also surpassed a 283.44 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [eight-week double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-double-bottom-base-biotech-stocks/). Monday afternoon's decline of 2% looks reasonable so far.




Despite Monday's pullback, the large-cap stock is trading nearly 14% above its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). And while the stock is breaking out, it is still in the IBD buy zone after Friday's [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).


In this situation, a strategy known as a broken wing butterfly could make sense. This strategy looks to profit from stable to slightly higher prices over the short-term.


TWLO stock is currently only ranked 16th in the enterprise software group, but [according to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-twilio-inc-cl-a-twlo.aspx), it does have an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 and an RS Rating of 97.


Counting against the stock is an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 74.


With a regular butterfly option trade, the wings are placed an equal distance from the short strike, but with a broken wing butterfly we leave a larger gap on a particular side.


This results in less risk on one side and more risk on the opposite side.


Twilio Stock Today: Constructing A Broken Wing Butterfly In Options
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on TWLO, based on recent trading action ahead of the stock's move lower on Monday.


* Buy 1 Nov. 20-expiring 290 call @ 27.10
* Sell 2 Nov. 20 call at 310 @ 19.00
* Buy 1 Nov. 20 call at 350 @ 9.70


Notice that the lower strike call is 20 points away from the middle call and the upper call is 40 points away.



This broken wing butterfly trade will generate $120 in premium for the entire trade. There is no loss potential on the downside. So the worst that can happen is all the calls expire worthless and the trader gets to keep the $120 premium.


On the upside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the width between the first two strikes (20) multiplied by 100 and subtracting the premium received (120). That gives us 20 x 100 — 120 = $1,880.


Calculate the maximum gain this way: 20 x 100 + 120 = $2,120.


Reward Vs. Risk
---------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/wOPTIONS01005-300x170.jpg)The ideal scenario for the trade is that TWLO stock stays flat initially and then slowly rises to close around 310 at expiration.


The risk on the trade is that TWLO shoots significantly higher, particularly early in the trade. For that reason, bullish traders would prefer to look at a [vertical spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/nvidia-stock-will-this-bullish-option-trade-in-nvidia-stock-produce-profit/) or a straight [long call](https://www.investors.com/research/options/adobe-stock-using-long-call-option-strategy-to-gain-leveraged-exposure/).


For those with a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, a broken wing butterfly could be a nice way to trade Twilio stock.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 20% of the capital at risk (0.20 x 1,880 = $376).


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

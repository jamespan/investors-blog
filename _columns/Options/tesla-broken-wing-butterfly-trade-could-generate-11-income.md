**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) witnessed a remarkable surge Monday. [A Morgan Stanley upgrade](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-given-upgrade-on-supercomputer-adding-half-a-trillion-dollars-in-value/) sent Tesla stock 10% higher. It joined [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) early in the day and already had a nice profit due to the sharp rise.




Today's strategy will use puts to create a broken-wing butterfly that can provide a little income on the upside or a healthy profit zone on the downside.


TSLA stock has reclaimed its position above the 50-day moving average, and it appears poised to stay above this key level.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Tesla stock is ranked No. 2 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 93 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92.


Setting Up A Broken-Wing Butterfly On Tesla Stock
-------------------------------------------------


With a butterfly option strategy you sell two options at the same strike and then buy an option on strikes at either side for protection. These strikes are equal distance from the short strike.


You also have two break-evens with the regular butterfly. One where the stock trades higher than your expected range and one where it trades lower.


But for this Tesla stock option trade, we'll use a broken-wing butterfly. The difference is that you leave a larger gap on a particular side. It's often also known as a skip-strike butterfly because you skip the strike on one side and go to the next one.


This results in less risk on one side and more risk on the opposite side.


Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on TSLA stock. We'll use puts for this trade because the strikes will all be below the stock price. This helps to reduce assignment risk.


* Buy to open 1 TSLA stock Oct. 20-expiration put with a 240 strike price @ 6.50
* Sell to open 2 TSLA Oct. 20 puts with a 255 strike price @ 11.20 each
* Buy to open 1 TSLA Oct. 20 put with a 265 strike price @ 15.40 each


Notice that the upper strike put is 10 points away from the middle put. The lower put "skipped" the 245 strike and went to the 240 strike that is 15 points away.



Managing The Trade
------------------


This broken wing butterfly trade will result in a net credit of $50, which means there is no risk if the stock remains above 265.


The downside risk is if Tesla stock falls below 245. The maximum loss is calculated as the difference in the widths (15 — 10 = 5) multiplied by 100 minus the credit received. That works out to a maximum loss of $450. A highly likely scenario is that Tesla stock stays here or goes higher and you get an 11% return on risk ($50 profit/$450 maximum loss).

But if Tesla stock drifts lower to the short strikes at 255, your profit actually goes higher. If Tesla stock closes right at 255 at expiration, both the short strikes would expire worthless as well as the long put at 240. You would have 10 points of premium on the 265 put plus the credit received for a maximum potential profit of $1,050.


The ideal scenario for the trade is that TSLA stock stays flat initially and then slowly drifts lower to close around 255 at expiration. There is a large profit zone between 245 and 265.


As the trade starts with delta of 2, it has a slight bullish bias to start, but that will flip to negative delta closer to expiry if the stock is still above 265.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 20% of the capital at risk, or if TSLA broke below 245.

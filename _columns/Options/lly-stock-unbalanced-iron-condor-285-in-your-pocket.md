**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) [rallied to record highs](https://www.investors.com/news/sp-500-giants-stocks-near-buy-points/) in May thanks to a positive trial for its Crohn's disease treatment. So, today we are looking at an unbalanced iron condor, with a slightly bullish bias, in LLY stock.




You can achieve this type of iron condor by trading more put spreads than call spreads.


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


LLY Stock: The Setup
--------------------


First, we take the bull put spreads. Using the July 19 expiry, we could sell two put spreads with the 760-750 strike prices. That spread could be sold for around $0.95 a share, based on recent trading. Selling two contracts would generate $190.


Then set up the bear call spread. Place it in LLY stock by selling the 910 call and buying the 920 call. This spread could also be sold for around $0.95. Trading two put spreads for every one call spread gives the trade a slight bullish bias, but also more risk on the downside.


In total, the iron condor will generate around $2.85 a share or $285 of premium per set of contracts in LLY stock.


**Profit And Loss Zones**
-------------------------



The profit zone ranges between 757.15 and 912.85. Calculate it by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


The maximum risk winds up as $1,715 on the put side and $715 on the call side. If we take the premium ($285) divided by the maximum risk ($1,715), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 16.62%.


A stop loss in this case might be calculated based on 25% of capital at risk, so a loss of around $430.

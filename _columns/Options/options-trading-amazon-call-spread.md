How can I trade 100 shares of a $1,700 stock like **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) for only $600? Using an options trading strategy, that's how.




Yesterday I got a buzz on my phone, and like most people I assumed it was a call or text message. Typically all of my notifications are turned off except for calls, text messages and, of course, trade ideas.


So needless to say yesterday when I got notification of a good trade being added to Swing Trader at Investors.com, I was instantly interested. The swing trade opportunity was for Amazon and looked to be an attractive opportunity for a short-term swing trade to the buy side.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/TEST3.jpg)When I went to research the stock, I followed the same process I always do. The first thing I did was to identify if the stock fit my entry criteria. After that, I looked at the options chain to leverage a good stock trade. Typically, when presented with a good opportunity to go long on a top performing stock in a top sector, I would first start with simply buying a call.


Options Trading Explained
-------------------------


An important note is that one of my very simple rules about options trading is this: Every good options trade first must start out as a good stock trade. There is no simpler way to state that rule. Ideas from the Swing Trader list is a good place to start.


The problem for many traders was that Amazon was trading at roughly 1,740 per share at the time, which put it out of many traders' price range. In most instances, I wouldn't view this as problematic, because we could just trade the call option in lieu of trading the stock for a much lower cost.


Options Trading In Amazon
-------------------------


However, after doing some more research I found that the September 1,730 call option which had 73 days until expiration were trading for roughly $97 a share. If I felt like the trade might take a bit longer to reach target, then the October options would be the right choice.


The October option, which had 101 days until expiration of the same 1,730 strike would cost about $111 per share. This means that in order to do 100 shares (one contract of a standard option) I would have to put up either $9,700 for the September option or $11,100 for the October option.


In the eyes of many investors, Amazon has risen too much to be a good stock trade or an options trade. Remember that every good options trade first starts as a good stock trade. A good investor doesn't want to miss out on a great opportunity. The goal is to participate in the movement of a good stock trade but lower our cost basis by doing a different type of options trade.


Amazon Spread Trade
-------------------


The answer in this case, and in many other cases, is to do a spread trade. A spread trade consists of buying one option while at the same time selling another option to finance the trade. By doing this, an investor greatly reduces the out-of-pocket cash necessary as well as the total exposure. The downside is that profits are also capped, which is the trade-off that an investor must endure.


In this case, let's look at a "bull call spread," where we'll buy a call and sell another call to help pay for it. So let's go back and look at the September call option. In this example, for the sake of simplicity, the cost has been rounded to a whole number between the bid and the ask to make the point easily understandable.


* Buy a call option expiring in September with a 1,730 strike price (cost $97):


This is the example of simply buying the call which would result in a debit of $9,700 plus commissions for just one contract. For investors looking for a speculative trade, this might be more than they are willing to invest. The alternative is to fund the purchase of the call with the sale of another call.


* Sell a call option expiring in September with a 1,740 strike price (cost $91):


Notice that we are buying the 1,730 Call and selling the 1,740 Call, which is a $10 spread. The spread of $10 creates a banded profit area as well as a banded loss area, limited to the amount of the spread. In this example, we have a $97 debit which is then funded by a $91 credit. The result is a $6 debit.


Protected From Big Loss
-----------------------


If Amazon were to have a catastrophic loss with this position, the most we could lose is $6 per share. Our total investment for 100 shares (one contract) is now only $600. In this case we would still have a stop loss in place so that we would not lose the entire $600, but in any case (such as an extreme gap) we have limited our exposure.


In exchange for limiting our exposure we are now limiting our gain to only $4 per share, or $400 per contract. This sounds like a small amount, but when compared to limiting our out of pocket to only $600 this becomes an excellent opportunity for a high percentage return trade with limited downside risk.


As an investor we don't want to miss good opportunities in great stocks when they present themselves. Spread trading is a strategy that investors may want to take the time to further investigate as a way to enhance overall investing performance.

With **Trade** **Desk** ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) breaking out to new highs, we can use options to take some exposure in a limited risk way. Let's look at a bull call spread trade in Trade Desk stock.




Investors interested in gaining bullish exposure can do so with much lower risk through a bull call spread. Create this setup by first buying a call option, then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade, but it also limits the upside.


**Trade Desk Stock Today**
--------------------------


Going out to the December expiration for Trade Desk stock, a 115-strike call option was trading around $6.30 per contract and the 120 call around $4.75, according to recent trading.


Buying the 115 call and selling the 120 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $155 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100), based on recent trading. This sets the maximum potential profit at $345 per set of contracts. Calculate this by taking the difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if TTD stock closes below 115 on Dec. 20, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $155 premium paid.



Potential gains get capped above 120. So, no matter how high Trade Desk stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $345. The break-even price for the trade is equal to the long call strike plus the premium, which in this case would equal 116.55.


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 98, I would consider closing early for a loss.

According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Trade Desk stock ranks No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 97 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90.


Trade Desk is due to report earnings in early November, so this trade would have earnings risk if held through then.

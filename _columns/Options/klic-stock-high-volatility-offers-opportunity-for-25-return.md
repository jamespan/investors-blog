**Kulicke & Soffa** ([KLIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KLIC)) is showing elevated implied volatility with an IV Percentile reading of 99%. 




That means that the current level of implied volatility in the chip-equipment company is higher than almost all other readings in the past 12 months. 


Iron condors are a strategy that's best placed when implied volatility is high. When volatility is high, the iron condor can be placed further out-of-the-money, giving the trade a higher chance at success. 


Let's look at an example using KLIC stock. 


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction. 


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Nov. 19 expiry, we could sell the 50 put and buy the 45 put. That spread could be sold on Friday for around $0.55. 


Then the bear call spread could be placed by selling the 65 call and buying the 70 call. This spread could be sold on Friday for around $0.45. 


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1 per contract, or $100 of premium. 


The profit zone ranges between 49 and 66. This can be calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received. 


Because both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 — 1 x 100 = $400. Therefore, if we take the premium ($100) divided by the maximum risk ($400), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 25%. 



If price action stabilizes, then iron condors will work well. However, if KLIC stock continues to bounce around, the trade will suffer losses. 


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $100, so we could set a stop loss at 1.5 times the premium, or a loss of around $150. 


Earnings for Kulicke & Soffa are expected to be announced on Nov. 17, so this trade would have earnings risk if held to expiration. 


The stock last month regained its [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/) after taking a steep drop.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

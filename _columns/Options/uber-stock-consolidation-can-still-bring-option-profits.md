Periods of consolidations can be frustrating for investors sitting through them. But it doesn't mean those periods have to be unprofitable. Here's a way to generate income on Uber stock using a long-term option strategy.




Cash-secured Put Strategy On Uber Stock
---------------------------------------


**Uber** ([UBER](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBER)) has consolidated between 50 and 60 for the last few months. Rather than looking at such periods as "dead money," you could use options to generate a return during sideways action.



Let's say you have $6,000 and want to invest in Uber stock. You could simply buy some shares and hope the stock rises.


But here's a more conservative play that generates income. Sell a Jan 21, 2022 put with a strike price of 55 and set aside the $5,500 in case you are assigned on the short put. Remember when you are selling a put, you are under the obligation to buy the shares at the strike price if the buyer so chooses.


That sold put at the 55 strike generates around $6.80 in option premium in just over nine months.


So, the $5,500 set aside (that's the cash-secured part) for Uber is generating a potential annualized return of 18.3%.


Profit And Loss On The Trade
----------------------------


What's the catch? Well, much like owning Uber stock outright, if the price keeps dropping, the sold put will lose money in the short-term.


Also, if Uber stock is below 55 next January, then as the put seller you are obligated to buy 100 shares at 55. Even in that case, you are better off than if you had bought Uber stock initially and held for the same period. The premium received would give you a lower cost basis for the stock.


However, if Uber stock stays above 55 then the put expires worthless and the trade achieves the 18.3% per annum return.


Cash-secured puts are a bullish strategy but are considered slightly less bullish than owning Uber stock. The potential gains are limited to the premium received. So you would miss out on a big gain if Uber stock takes off.

The 55 strike put currently has a delta of 35, so selling this put gives an exposure roughly equivalent to owning 35 shares of Uber stock. It's important to note though that it will change as the stock moves up and down.


An Alternative Option Trade
---------------------------


One method that can help cut the risk even more is to turn it into a spread. If you buy a 50 strike put with the same expiration, the trade turns into a bull put spread.


This is one of my favorite strategies for generating income on stocks. Especially if it's a stock I'm willing to own at a lower price.


UBER stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 63, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 36 and an RS Rating of 80.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

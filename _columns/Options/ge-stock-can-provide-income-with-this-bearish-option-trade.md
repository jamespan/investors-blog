It was a big move in the Nasdaq composite Wednesday and it lifted many stocks even further from their lows. **General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) is up over 20% from its lows earlier this month. But if you think the upside is limited on GE stock from here, a bear call spread can bring you some income.




Bear Call Spread On GE Stock
----------------------------


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways or even slightly higher. GE stock just has to stay below the short call at expiry.


Yesterday, a bear call spread on GE stock using the Aug. 19 expiration and 75-80 strike prices was trading at around $0.70. That requires selling the 75 call and simultaneously buying the 80 call. This bear call spread jumped to roughly $1.50 today.


If executed at that price, the maximum profit on the trade would be $150 per contract with a maximum risk of $350. That's a 43% return on risk in just a matter of weeks.


How The Trade Works
-------------------


The spread on GE stock achieves the maximum profit if GE stock closes below 75 at the Aug. 19 expiration. In that case, the entire spread expires worthless and the trader gets to keep the $150 option premium.


The maximum loss occurs if GE stock closes above 80 on Aug. 19. Buying the 80 call gives you protection on your short call and makes it a risk-defined trade. While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, with the bear call spread you always know the worst-case scenario in advance. The maximum loss is capped at $350 for this trade.



But remember, you don't need to take the maximum loss. You might use a stop loss if GE stock starts trading much above 75. Or, if the value of the spread doubles from your $1.50 premium to $3, you could cover the position early and take a smaller loss.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), GE stock ranks No. 15 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 44, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 72 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 26. The weakness in the ratings is part of the basis for the bearish posture.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

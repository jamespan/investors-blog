When looking to trade directionally our typical go-to strategy of choice is the vertical due to its relative simplicity and flexible design. From out-of-the money bearish put spreads initiated for a limited risk debit to the other side of the spectrum, an out-of-the money credit call spread with equally secure risk. What could be better? Well, how about combining these positions into what we'll call some vertical integration? 

  

The variations on vertical integration are literally infinite. When looking at different width verticals, contract ratios and distance from the underlying stock price in liquid products such as the **DJ-30 ETF**  ([DIA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIA)) or **S&P500**  ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) offer up possibilities like the one shown below

  

  

This particular integration of verticals has been constructed using a 4 x October 116 / 118 bear call and 1 x October 111 / 105 bear put spread in the DJ-30. With shares near 111, the two combined to produce a mid market credit of $0.32 which would be kept at expiration if shares of DIA were nestled between 111 and 116. Above that, there's approximately 4% portfolio risk above 118 based on a model $20K portfolio. And on the upside for this bear's integrated efforts, it's obviously all the more about the downside for the time being.

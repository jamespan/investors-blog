Government and retail surplus seller and No. 1 ranked IBD 50 constituent **Liquidity Services**  ([LQDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LQDT)) is seeing a 1,200% lift above its typical option auctioning efforts as more than 2,300 contracts have changed hands Wednesday. The stock usually trades only about 150 contracts.

  

With shares off about 9% and an hour to go, a few sessions of consolidation work around 50-day moving average support has been decisively rejected and the lows of what appears to be a late-stage base have been undercut.

  

Fresh news drivers aren't on the radar, but recent concerns of competition from **eBay** ([EBAY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBAY)) within its niche online markets and an SEC filing from Friday revealing the company's chairman selling roughly 40% of his stake to diversify, while remaining its largest shareholder, could be assisting in Wednesday's bearish action. 

  

For their part, option traders are bidding up premiums by about 20% today into the high 50s to mid-60s in August and later dated expiration months. Compared to underlying volatility, prices are somewhat rich at an eye-balled premium in the neighborhood of 20% versus statistical values in the high 40s prior to the last couple days' worth of technical fallout. 

  

As far as actual trading however, with fairly illiquid markets making slippage a very real, real world concern, roughly 70% of Wednesday's actual trading is in the July contract. Front-month options are priced slightly tighter and showing implieds slightly below the likes of August. The modest discrepancy is likely tied to Liquidity Services next earnings release which looks to be unveiled on August 2 and outside the July contract, which despite the stock's current outsized volatility, is now facing increased time decay exposure. 

  

Most active on the board, bulls, bears and maybe a hedgehog or two are opening positions in the surrounding money July 55 call and 50 put. Given what's been expressed, the initiation of long calls and puts followed by married puts and buy-writes, possibly some strangles and then maybe some interest by traders initiating collars is how we'd estimate today's trading as unfolding. That said, with interest of just 550 or so in the calls and about 400 in the puts, the term "wasted assets" rather than merely "wasting assets" comes to mind given the more than 3.5 million shares traded.

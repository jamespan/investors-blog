On Monday analysts at Goldman Sachs announced a handful of downgrades and upgrades on names in the fertilizer / agricultural chemicals arena. Under the influence of the muscular broker, fresh "Sell" ratings on **Agrium** ([AGU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AGU)) and **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)) resulted in lower share prices on the day despite the market's optimistic jump higher into key resistance on an abundance of supportive sounding headline drivers. 

  

At the same time, upgrades to "Buy" for **Potash** ([POT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=POT)) and "Neutral" for **Intrepid** ([IPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IPI)) showed some investor support. However, the gains on the day did little to truly help out what look like technically damaged charts prone to further pressure. 

  

In Tuesday's session and as the broader market tries to establish it's profit-taking as the constructive type within a market still under correction, the "Aggies" as a whole are seeing a bit of relative laggardship that looks ripe for bearish harvesting. One spot that appears to be attracting the attention of one or more bears in the option market is the **Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF**  ([MOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOO)). 

  

In otherwise quiet trade MOO has seen nearly 700 of its slightly in-the-money April 55 puts trade. Compared to open interest of just over 200, the initiating party or parties (as I didn't check for prints) are likely opening positions.

  

Shares of MOO are off about -0.75% and setting up a two-day reversal pattern, which follows a gap fill on a fast countertrend i.e. bear market, rally. As much, we'll make the assumption today's order flow was buying puts in anticipation of imminent downside in the coming days. 

  

  

Of course, without checking prints for stronger clues of what really transpired, it's always possible an opening buyer could be establishing a synthetic long call or even a straddle. It's also a possibility a purchase could be against existing long stock inventory from sometime prior and making our guesswork even more open-ended. 

  

In truth, with premiums in the low 20s within recent range values and priced relatively fair compared to historic, realized, statistical or underlying volatility in the shares; I can't blame anyone for using protection in those capacities.

  

But and as illustrated above, Tuesday's put action looks more like a fertile short opportunity to this strategist for bears suiting up and willing to use additional measures of protection.

IBD 50 constituent **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is inching its way closer towards Tuesday night's earnings release in what will undoubtedly be the main course for many investors in a smorgasbord of corporate releases this week. In front of the event, implieds have been on the rise in the Weeklys July. Profiting on that movement however, has been another matter.

  

The Weeklys July contract began trading last Thursday and expires this Friday. While the contract's life is short, the calls and puts are important as they're the closest vehicle traders have to an earnings pure play. With Apple known for having its share of decent reactions, the last two events producing upside gaps of 8.9% and 6.2%, a bid into the event marked by rising implieds, might seem understandable. But is being on the right side of an increase from the high 40s into the mid-60s actually profitable? 

  

Thus far, the simple answer and one which doesn't attempt to account for delta neutral hedging is the position has been largely a push. Specifically, last Thursday's bid for the ATM Weeklys July 615 straddle amounted to a mid-market price tag of $34.40 on implieds of 47% with shares at 614.32. Fast forward two trading sessions and AAPL stock at 602.63, the straddle is trading for $34.15 or showing an unrealized loss of $0.25 per spread despite a healthy move away from the strike and implieds increasing to about 64%. 

  

The culprits responsible for preventing easy connect-the-dot profitability as implieds rose from 47% to 64% despite owning a long volatility position, is decidedly less "oomph" per point in vega for each one unit increase in implied volatility and an equally menacing increase in theta or time decay over the same period. Checking our Greeks from last Thursday night to intraday Monday reveals vega has dropped from about $72 per point, per spread to roughly $50 and will continue to shrink into expiration as options become either stock equivalents or worthless. 

  

At the same time, theta, which is also known as the cost of gamma, tears increasingly away at any time value on options so that come expiration, all those stock equivalent in-the-money contracts are priced on par with stock, while still out-of-the-money calls and puts are priced as worthless. In the case of the straddle in AAPL, the spread has moved from holding decay of just more than $200 daily to a figure of about $385. 

  

A quick and dirty comparison of a 17 point benefit in implieds worth $50 a point amounts to an increase in the straddle value of $850. But if we cheat and take an average of about $290 time decay, which isn't linear, three days of theta chops away a similar $870 in value. While it's not perfect, making sure to give those other Greeks, away from the day's headlines, is some food for thought for option traders looking to better measure straddles for their potential risks and rewards.

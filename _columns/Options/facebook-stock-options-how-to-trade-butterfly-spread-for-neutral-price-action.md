Facebook stock has been incredibly strong recently, rising from 140 to 213 and today I want to look at an options trade that would benefit from neutral price action over the next month.




After such a strong run, **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is possibly due for a pause, and given that it is such a strong stock, I can't see it pulling back too much. I'm expecting sideways action. As such, I would look at entering a butterfly trade for the June expiration period.


A butterfly is a neutral, income-oriented strategy. It is a limited-risk and limited-profit trade. But on a typical butterfly trade, the profit potential is higher than the potential loss.


Butterfly spreads involve three different option strike prices, all with the same expiration date, and can be created using either calls or puts.


A typical butterfly would be constructed as follows:


* Buy one in-the-money call
* Sell two at-the-money calls
* Buy one out-of-the-money call


Let's take a look at how that might look on Facebook stock.


* Buy one June 19 195 call at 21.30.
* Sell two June 19 215 calls at 7.50.
* Buy one June 19 235 call @ 1.25.


The total cost of this trade is $755 and that is the maximum loss potential on the trade.


Maximum Gain And Risk
---------------------


The maximum gain is $1,245, which is calculated by taking the difference in strike prices less the premium paid ($2,000 less $755).


The breakeven prices are 202.55 and 227.45 (215 plus and minus 12.45)


A butterfly options trade has a tent-like shape with the potential for very large profits around the short strike. It's important to keep in mind that it's unlikely you would ever achieve the maximum profit.


A good aim for a butterfly trade is to make a 20% return on capital at risk. In this case that would be around $150.


Butterfly spreads can be a bit confusing for beginners, so it's best to paper trade this way and see how it performs.


Facebook is ranked No. 1 in its industry group and has a [Relative Strength Rating of 87](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/relative-price-strength--op-rs-cp--rating-or-relative-strength), on a 1-99 scale with 99 tops. It also has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 and an [EPS Rating](https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-terms/EPS-Rating) of 96.


Facebook is currently trading above its 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages and those moving averages are sloping upward. That's generally a bullish sign.


However, there is [overhead resistance](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-reading-overhead-supply/) from the January high around 225 and it's hard to see too much further upside from here in the short-term.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

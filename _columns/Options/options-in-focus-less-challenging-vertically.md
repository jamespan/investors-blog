IBD 50 constituent **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) is in the ignominious position of its shares dropping by a rather heavy -6.0% after gapping below its 50-day simple moving average during late trade Tuesday. Aside from the broader market's own weakness on the session, news accounting for the pressure is absent and despite a trio of brokers, Piper, Deutsche Bank and Wedge Partners defending the name intraday. 

  

Given today's disappointing price action, particularly in lieu of a friendly analyst community; for traders that don't mind positioning during a correction or what could be a full-fledged bear market, the bear vertical spread is one to consider. 

  

Using either all calls for a credit or all puts for a debit, this vertical entails purchasing the higher strike and selling the lower strike. Using the same strikes, they are one in the same as far as the risk / reward graph and in the eyes of your broker. 

  

With decent liquidity in both option types in BIDU, the only difference worth thinking about is the small possibility of surprise assignment risk with a deeper call bear spread. If that were to occur, the trader would be left holding a synthetic long put. However, that's generally not something to fear in a security such as BIDU with its high capitalization and low short interest.

  

If the synthetic position can be held in an account with sufficient capital and barring an attached large move to the upside in shares, the trader could be in the position of now holding a paper profit. That's one advantage of an assignment in this situation. 

  

Another potential bonus from an assignment is the dollar risk of the long synthetic put will still be the same as the risk accepted from the vertical. Now however, there's a much larger potential return on investment if shares were to actually drop hard and fast in price during the life of this new and possibly, improved position.

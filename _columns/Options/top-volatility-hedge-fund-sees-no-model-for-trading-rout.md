Rune Madsen is having a pretty good week.


His Runestone Capital Fund has managed to avoid losses even as global markets slipped into spasm after U.K. voters opted out of the European Union. The $10 million volatility hedge fund wagered on U.S. equity swings via instruments such a futures, S&P 500 Index options and exchange-traded products.


Long volatility has been roughly the only place to hide in a market downdraft that threatens to lop $2 trillion from global equity value in the space of a few hours. The strategy involves owning anything that gets more valuable as share prices widen, a good bet on a day when the MSCI All-Country World Index is down 3%.


"In these kinds of markets, as a long-short volatility trader, you can have your best day or your worst," Madsen said from London on a day that started for him at 1:30 a.m.. "We've caught some of the up and down moves this week so we're net positive."


Gauges of share volatility rose the most since the selloff of Aug. 24, with the CBOE Volatility Index climbing 43% to the highest in four months. In Tokyo, the Nikkei Volatility Index jumped as much as 26% earlier, while convulsions in Europe's equity market pushed a measure of 30-day swings in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index close to the highest in five years.


"I won't take my eyes off my screen," said Madsen, whose hedge fund is up 30% this year and has outperformed 98% of its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "There's no model that can predict a day like this, where volatility can move up or down 10% in 15 minutes. There's a coffee machine near my desk and that's about how far I'll go."


As financial markets awakened to the prospect of Britain quitting the EU, risk assets slumped from Asia to Europe and the U.S. As of 12:40 p.m. in London, the MSCI All-Country World Index was down 3% -- set for the biggest plunge since August.


Trading of options and derivatives has risen in instruments that gain with market turbulence, among them VIX futures. Daily volume in those exceeded 122,000 contracts this week, 40% above the 2016 average prior to that. A spread monitored by options traders to track demand for protective hedges -- implied versus realized volatility on the S&P 500 -- widened to a record in recent days even as shares powered higher.


"There was some blind optimism in the market although polls were always very tight," said Chetun Patel, the London-based head of strategy at Mariana Capital Markets LLP, a brokerage that specializes in equity derivatives. "I don't think the market was positioned for it."


The U.K. will have two years to negotiate its EU exit, the first ever from the 28-nation union. Britain's decision comes at a time of extreme skepticism about the effectiveness of central-bank stimulus. Possible consequences of the U.K. leaving may include a spike in inflation for the nation, a rise in unemployment and even a recession. Governor Mark Carney said the Bank of England is ready to pump billions of pounds into the financial system, while the European Central Bank said it's ready to provide liquidity in euros or other currencies.


"The moves we're getting in volatility around the world are not one-day events," Madsen said. "It's not just a bad economic release. It's essentially a change of path."

When the dust settled or should I say when the fertilizer settled on Tuesday's earnings reaction for agricultural chemicals producer **CF Industries**  ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)), shares managed to gain about 1.3% despite mixed results. Technically, CF remains situated within a six-week high handle or flat base pattern formed around its prior all-time highs set back in early May. 

  

On spot not so fortunate to rally around the results were CF Industries Weeklys options. Bulls and bears buying premium in front of the event unsurprisingly take a dip from last night's close as uncertainty surrounding the event was removed. The bad news for bearish buyers of puts, the triple whammy of being wrong on their delta bias, time decay and implieds getting mowed down by about 40% took their toll on those contracts life. 

  

Case in point, last night's slightly out-of-the-money AugWk2 200 put fetched $3.65 on 61% IV with shares near 203.50. By Tuesday's close and CF near 206, the contract is priced for about $0.95 with implieds off about 20 points at 42%. The 205 put with its larger delta fared even worse with a mid-market price of $2.50 which compares to yesterday's close of $6.00. 

  

At the same time, call buyers also ended up on the short end of the stick. The in-the-money 195 call which maintained about two points of extrinsic value and net market price of $10.40 on Tuesday was the first deeper strike to show any profitability, but only a puny $0.40 per contract to finish at $10.80 despite the gain in shares and its mid-70s delta. From there and looking at the near, at and out-of-money calls, bulls took a systematic hit with strikes from 200 and higher all showing losses. Ultimately, Tuesday's relatively small move wasn't enough to prevent time decay and lower implieds from eating away at the price of those contracts. 

  

It becomes quite obvious the big winner(s) are those traders which took the other side of being long puts, calls, straddles, strangles and the likes. In fact, even a miscued stock hedge or two during the day in order to keep the delta count flat, while reducing profitability should have been more a nuisance than menace. Of course, some verticals also made money depending on their positioning relative to shares. In-the-money spreads had the opportunity to expand towards max profitability and an at-the-money such as the 200 / 205 bull call spread benefited from its delta, time decay and vega allowance. 

  

  

Less obvious maybe and maybe to sow a fresh idea for option traders down the road, is the long time or calendar spread. Last night's decent volatility skew between contract months and fairly low implieds statistically allowed buyers of time spreads to capture profits as well. For instance, the Sept / AugWk2 205 call spread went from about $5.40 and an implied skew of nearly 25 points with the front sold contract near 60% IV and the long back month call around 35% IV, to $6.50 and virtually no skew with implieds in the low 30s for both. Now there's some food for thought that's worth fertilizing.

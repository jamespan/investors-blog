**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is one of [five tech giants near buy points to watch this week](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-facebook-microsoft-lam-research-taiwan-semi/).




Implied volatility on the parent of Google is just under 30%, which is toward the lower end of the 12-month range. That means options on Google stock are cheap compared to recent history.


When that occurs, it's better to be a net buyer of options rather than a [seller](https://www.investors.com/research/options/fedex-stock-offers-bullish-option-trade/).


Technically, the official entry is just above the mid-February all-time high, but aggressive investors may prefer to get in early. One way to do that in a risk-defined way is to use an option strategy such as a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.



Going out to May expiration, a 2,190 strike price call option was trading around $60.90 and the 2,200-strike call was around $57.20.


Buying the 2,190 call and selling the 2,200 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $370 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100) and the maximum profit potential would be $595 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


Risk Defined Strategy On Google Stock
-------------------------------------


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy. So if Google stock closes below 2,190 on May 21, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $370 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 2,200. So no matter how high GOOGL stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $630.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to GOOGL stock using options.


One thing to watch out for is the bid-ask spread, as this can be quite wide on Alphabet stock options.


In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $3.70 to $1.85, or if the stock dropped below 2,005, I would consider closing early for a loss. Otherwise, I would hold to expiry.


Good EPS, Composite Ratings
---------------------------


Google stock is showing a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 93 and an [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 69. The RS Rating has improved in recent weeks. Alphabet is also on [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/).


On Monday, Alphabet shares broke out of a flat base, rising past a 2,145.24 buy point.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

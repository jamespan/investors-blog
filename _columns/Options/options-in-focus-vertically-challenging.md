Spreads such as the bull-call vertical can be a great way to reduce the cost of a directional position compared to an outright purchase. That said, what if you use that trademark advantage coupled with the extra time allowance from using a longer-dated contract which might cost maybe a nickel or dime more or even less money than a much nearer to expiration vertical? If you do, we'd suggest being careful as you really do pay for that extra time in more than one way.

  

The bottom line is that the longer out in time one goes in positioning with a vertical, the more difficult it is to realize the possibility for an option's extrinsic or time value to drop off completely. For a bull call spread this means its ability to expand towards its maximum worth prior to expiration is very difficult barring a significant move well beyond the higher short strike.

  

Bearing that in mind, traders need to be aware of this potential negative characteristic before positioning with longer-term verticals. If a trader is overly fixated on how much more time he or she might have to remain in the position for just a tiny bit more capital or perhaps even a slight discount depending on the relationship of strikes to stock and implied volatility, the surprise of feeling cheated if the stock cooperates a bit faster than planned could be the unintended result.

  

  

To illustrate let's look at situation in the **iShares Silver**  ([SLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLV)) product comparing 10x September 31 / 32.5 bull call spreads versus 10x November 31 / 32.5 verticals with shares near $31.25. The former and near-term spread is currently priced at $0.59, while the latter November vertical with its extra 56 days on the calendar cost just $0.06 more at $0.65 per spread. That sounds quite reasonable, right? So what gives?

  

If a picture can speak a thousand words, we hope when you look above at the comparison of the two verticals you can appreciate "what gives" and why a measly $0.06 more for a good deal more time could nonetheless be a costly decision or at least a bit aggravating at times. For instance, if shares jumped sharply and quickly by 9% to $34, the difference in profits of about $350 versus $675 or about 50%. In the end or at least those calendar days between spreads, if the vertical trader doesn't appreciate the negative aspect of time remaining until expiration, the difference in the here and now can prove disappointing should the bull move faster and more aggressively than expected.

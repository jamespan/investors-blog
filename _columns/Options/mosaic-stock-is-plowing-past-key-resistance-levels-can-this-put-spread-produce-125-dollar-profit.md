**Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) dropped from 79.28 to 42.50 before the stock rallied back to as high as 54.84 this week. The stock is reclaiming both the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and the [longer-term 200-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-a-winning-stock-spot-a-breach-of-200-day-line/), a pair of significant technical levels.




So, when a quality company has a big drop like this, I like to use a strategy called a diagonal put spread.


This option strategy is an advanced strategy because it utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.


Let's look at an example with Tampa-based Mosaic and its stock using both monthly and weekly options.


Mosaic Stock: Setting Up A Diagonal Put Spread
----------------------------------------------


The trade I'm looking at is selling an Aug. 19-expiring put in the agricultural chemicals producer with a strike price of 50 and buying a Sept. 2-expiration weekly put with a strike price of 48. As of Tuesday's close, the Aug. 19 put sold for around 1.40. And a trader could have bought the Sept. 2 put for 1.46 — costing $146 to get the right to sell 100 shares at the strike price of 48.



The net cost on the trade totals $6. That highlights the most the trade could lose on the upside.


This trade in Mosaic stock harbors a potential maximum loss of $206. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread (2) multiplied by 100 and adding in the cost of the trade (6).


The maximum potential gain centers on $125, which will occur if MOS closes right at 50 on Aug. 19.


**The Profit Zone**
-------------------


The trade has a nice profit zone from 47.80 to 57. Aiming for a return of around 10% to 15% makes sense. Plus, I would set a similar stop loss.


The worst-case scenario: You experience a sharp drop in MOS stock early in the trade. For this reason, if the stock drops below 48 in the next few days, I would also consider closing the trade early to minimize losses.


The initial trade setup has a delta of 5, meaning the position is roughly equivalent to owning 5 share of MOS stock. Note that this delta number can change significantly as the stock starts to move.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Mosaic's stock ranks fourth in its agricultural chemicals group overall. It sports a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 81 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

The August market decline and possibly some fear of September and October have caused a number of good quality stocks to fall dramatically in price. A dead cat bounce is a minimal recovery in price for a stock that has been badly beaten up. If a stock that was recently $50 and is now $18 recovers to $27, that is a 50% jump. But, if that stock only rises to say $21, then that's a dead cat bounce!

  

Buying calls is frequently thought to be inadequate for trading small stock price rises, because the time premium portion of a call's price can sometimes be considerable. For example, if XYZ stock is trading at $18, and if the 60-day 17.50 Call is trading for 2.25, then the break-even point at expiration is 19.75 (17.50 + 2.25). If a stock price rise to $21.00 is expected, one might reasonably ask, "Why should I risk 2.25 to make 1.25?" With a stock price of $21.00 at option expiration, a 17.50 call will be worth 3.50 (21.00 — 17.50). Purchasing this call at 2.25 and selling it at 3.50 results in a profit of 1.25, not including commissions.

  

Given this forecast, a stock price rise from $18 to $21 in 60 days, is there a strategy with a better risk-reward ratio? The answer is yes!

  

**Bull Call Spread Defined**

  

The purchase of one call and simultaneous sale of a second call with the same underlying and same expiration but with a higher strike price is known as a bull call spread. Bull call spreads must be done in a margin account, with prior approval from a brokerage firm is required.

  

Graph 1 illustrates a Bull Call Spread in which one XYZ 17.50 Call is purchased for 2.25, and one XYZ 22.50 Call is sold for 0.75. The net price for this spread, therefore, is 1.50.

  

The name Bull call spread describes three aspects of the position. First, this is a bull call spread, because the position has a tendency to profit as the underlying stock price rises. Second, this is a bull call spread, because only call options are involved. Third, this is a spread, because two different options are involved. The term spread is used loosely to describe a wide range of multiple-option positions, but, in this example, it refers to the 5-point difference, or spread, between the strike prices of the 17.50 and 22.50 Calls.

  

The break-even point of this bull call spread is 19.00, which is calculated by adding the net premium paid, 1.50, to the strike price of the long call, 17.50.

  

**Common Terminology**

  

It is common practice to describe a bull call spread using the lower strike first. Hence the name for the position in Graph 1 is a 17.50 — 22.50 Bull Call Spread.

  

Bull call spreads are sometimes referred to as "long call spreads" or "debit call spreads," because they are established for a net payment, or net debit. The spread in Graph 1, for example, is established by buying the 17.50 Call for 2.25, and simultaneously selling the 22.50 Call at 0.75. The result is a net payment, or net debit, of 1.50, not including commissions.

  

**Profit/Loss at Expiration**

  

At expiration, there are three possible outcomes. The underlying stock can be at or below the lower strike, above the lower strike but not above the higher strike, and above the higher strike. The straight line in Graph 1 illustrates these possibilities.

  

Outcome 1: If the stock price is at or below the lower strike at expiration, then both calls expire worthless, and the full amount paid, 1.50 plus transaction costs in this example, is lost.

  

Outcome 2: If the stock price is above the lower strike but not above the higher strike, then the long call (lower strike) will likely be exercised, and the short call (higher strike) expires worthless. Exercise of a long call means that the underlying stock is purchased. Consequently, this outcome results in a long stock position at an effective price of 19.00 per share. This price is calculated by adding the net premium paid (1.50) to the strike price of the exercised call (17.50).

  

Outcome 3: Finally, if the stock price is above the higher strike at expiration, then the long call is exercised (stock is purchased at $17.50 in this example), and the short call is assigned (stock is sold at $22.50). The result is a net receipt equal to the difference between the strikes, which is 5.00 in this example. The initial amount paid, 1.50 in this example, is subtracted from the 5.00 received, and the result is the net profit of 3.50, not including commissions. This amount, the difference between the strikes less the net debit originally paid, is the maximum profit that can be earned with a bull call spread.

  

**Tradeoffs**

  

For "small price rises" in the underlying stock, bull call spreads have better risk-reward ratios than outright purchased calls. In the example above, if the stock price is $22.50 at expiration, then the profit from the bull call spread will be 3.50 not including commissions. Given a maximum risk of 1.50, the risk-reward ratio at a stock price of $22.50 is 1.50-to-3.50. This is better than the risk-reward of purchasing the 17.50 call outright, which is 2.25-to-2.75. The cost (and risk) of the 17.50 Call is 2.25, and the profit, with the stock price at $21 1/2 at expiration, is 2.75.

  

The negative aspect is that, in return for this improved risk-reward ratio for "small price rises," a bull call spread has limited profit potential. If the underlying stock rises beyond the strike price of the short call, then a bull call spread will not participate in the continued price rise.

  

**Summary**

  

A bull call spread has less risk and a lower break-even point than simply purchasing a call outright. For "small price rises," a bull call spread also has a better risk-reward ratio than a comparable long call.

  

If the stock price at expiration is above the higher strike price of a bull call spread, then the maximum profit potential is realized. If the stock price is between the strikes at expiration, then a long stock position will likely be established. The maximum loss is realized if the stock price, at expiration, is below the lower strike.

  

For traders who think that oversold stocks are likely to experience a dead cat bounce, a bull call spread is an alternative to consider.

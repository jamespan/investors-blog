**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is set to report earnings on [Thursday after the close](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), with an expected move of around 6.3%. 




Adobe stock is an  IBD [Long-Term Leader](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now-long-term-stocks-ibd-long-term-leaders-list/) and a [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank) stock. It has one of the most consistent track records of growth around, and annual estimates are solid for a company with a market capitalization of just over $300 billion. 


Let's analyze how we can structure an option trade that fits the view that (1) we think Adobe stock will stay within the expected range, and (2) the response to the earnings report is likely to be positive. 


Taking the at-the-money put and call for the Dec. 17 expiration, we see that the expected range is 6.3%. 


Now that we know the expected range let's find a bull put spread with a short strike roughly 6.3% below the stock price. 


Selling the Dec. 17, 615-strike put and buying the 610 put would create a bull put spread. 


This spread was trading for around $0.95 on Friday. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $95 in option premium with a maximum risk of $405. 


That represents a 23.5% return on risk between now and Dec. 17 if Adobe stock remains above 615. 


If ADBE closes below 610 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $405. 


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 614.05, which is calculated as 615 less the 0.95 option premium per contract. 


There is little room for adjustment with short-term trades such as this held over earnings. 


Risk Of 100% Loss
-----------------


A 23.5% return in a few days would be nice, but the possibility of losing 100% is also very real. 



As such, this style of trade is only for traders with high risk tolerance and should use appropriate position sizing. 


Depending on how Adobe stock trades today, traders may prefer to wait for a price higher than $0.95 for the spread. 


Adobe stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) Rating of 96, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 94 and a [Relative Strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) Rating of 89. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

IBD 50 constituent and online travel agent behemoth **Priceline.com**  ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) is currently under pressure in after-hours trading on the heels of its mixed corporate results. The retreat followed a brief and somewhat puzzling stab at higher prices.

  

With items like a $0.30 profit beat, in-line revenue growth of 28.1% and modestly bearish-bracketing Q2 EPS guidance, some bulls were nonetheless trying to make the case of the price being right for buying shares shortly after the report's release. One spot where the price was decidedly not right for buying though was Priceline's very pricey May Weeklys contracts. 

  

Priceline shares have a bit of notoriety for large post earnings reactions with recent moves of about 7%, 8.6%, -7.4% and -2.8% secured in its four most recent reports on a close-to-close basis. While the most recent three are fair-sized moves and certainly dizzying ones in dollar terms for the triple digit ticker; they're a far cry from today's 22% expectation. 

  

An expected move of 22% in shares is based on the ATM Weeklys implied priced late in the day near 140%. This means traders anticipate a one standard deviation or 68% chance PCLN stock will remain within 22% of tonight's closing price over the next two sessions.

  

Sometimes of course, consensus expectations are well off the mark as we recently discussed in **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)). In that situation, bulls' long premium or long curve with a strategy such as a purchased ATM straddle cashed in due to the wide miss in forecasting versus reality. However, tonight's lesson and a more common one at that, is strongly warning traders against being overly aggressive and paying a price William Shatner would surely frown upon.

With less than an hour to go, the broader market is still failing to put together a follow-through day on a fourth straight day of rallying on mixed volume and various index barometers caught toiling with their 50-day simple moving averages. 

  

Toss in sentiment that's gone from outright fearful to one strongly suggestive of investors fearful of missing out on further upside as evidenced by a complacent VIX differential in excess of 15% [spot vs. 10-SMA] and nominally cheap levels of 16.5%, and you have a recipe for a pullback. 

  

If Traders might also appreciate price action in the likes of the **S&P500** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) setting up a pivot high for a right shoulder within a bearish head and shoulders pattern roughly five months in the making. If you do agree, Thus the option to buy a put might be considered.

  

Given there's but 15 days until July expiration and come Tuesday, just nine trading days left, traders may wish to look at August or September puts as a way to play the still developing pattern without the "headache" of excessive negative theta.

  

Of course, should the bearish formation fail to improve directionally with some actual profit-taking and then more enduring bearish price action, traders will lose money on this type market bet. Bottom line, the delta risk will invariably prove detrimental even if implied volatility does move favorably higher in the coming days.

  

In the end, which is until expiration, the risk is limited by the number of contracts purchased, multiplied by some very cheap premium made more affordable by optimistic, theta-discounting bulls. Prior to that day, that amount can likely be reduced if a trader decides to throw in the towel for whatever reason. Personally though, seeing how bulls are seemingly in denial of what might possibly go wrong while they're on vacation and the rest of the world continues to do business as usual; a long put position seems like an option to consider further.

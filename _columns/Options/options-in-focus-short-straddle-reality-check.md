With less than half an hour to go in Monday's session, Jinkosolar Holdings Co. ([JKS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JKS)) is poised to finish in the top spot for above-average option volume within the IBD 50. Volume is running about 900% above average on 10,000 contracts with calls outpacing puts by nearly 5.0-to-1.0. 

  

Vying for traders' attention today, it's more or less a three-way tie between JKS' surrounding money front month calls. The in-the-money 25, slightly in-the-money 27 and out-of-the money 30 calls have traded roughly 1,500, 1,800 and 2,000 respectively. 

  

Shares of JKS have seen an ultra-volatile session marked by strong profit-taking into negative territory following an earnings-related upside gap in excess of 10% tied to its all-around better-than-expected earnings report. As much, the "who is doing what to whom", as one might imagine, becomes a bit more of a puzzle than usual. 

  

Implieds have pulled in and is typical following a fairly well-bid "volatility rush" situation. The at-the-money March contract has dropped about -15% from a level of 95% IV two sessions ago to today's 80% - 81% IV reading. 

  

As much and with JKS' share price nearly even with where it was Thursday evening; we can definitively say a March 28 straddle seller did quite well if they merely stood pat and have yet to make an adjustment or close the position. In fact, we can definitively say that a trader selling 10 spreads would be up $1,200 using mid market prices as the price has gone from $5.20 per straddle to $4.00.

  

  

No doubt, $1,200 is nice bit of volatility and theta to collect for just two full trading sessions. However, the risk in this type position shouldn't be overlooked. Remember this trader is taking on the equivalent of +1000 deltas (shares) on a downside move. The short straddle also means the trader is basically -1000 shares during a strong upside move in JKS. 

  

Today, strong percentage moves in opposite directions ended up cancelling one another out. But, that doesn't cancel out the reality of maintaining one's risk during the session and in the heat of the moment. Looking above and in appreciation of that, we're looking at what a $1,200 profit would look like if a trader had merely hedged about half their open net short delta risk when JKS was at 32. 

  

The position is still profitable but looking a lot less enviable with a gain of around $220. There is of course, time yet to still make about $4,000 compared to the initial idealized $5,200. But and as we've shown, there's also time yet to do the right thing and adjust. In the end, adherence to containing risk should serve us well over the long-run, but not necessarily on a daily basis.

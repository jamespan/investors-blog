  Pound Options Trades Show Optimism That Brexit Deal Will Succeed

Currency strategists see a wild 10% swing in the British pound as the Brexit saga approaches endgame. But options traders aren't betting on undue volatility.




The bulk of investors see a moderate gain or loss in the currency once the terms of the U.K.'s divorce with the European Union is finalized.


Sentiment in the options market is the most bearish on sterling since 2016. Yet the majority of recent trades have a strike price between $1.25 and $1.35, a move of just 2% to 5% from current levels.


That may show traders aren't expecting a no-deal Brexit, where the pound could crash, even though Prime Minister Theresa May's draft deal faces potential rejection by Parliament.


Options Traders See A Pound Rebound After Brexit
------------------------------------------------


And two out of three bets are for call options, showing investors are either looking to hedge short spot exposure in the pound. Or they may be taking advantage of cheaper pricing for a rebound.


If a Brexit deal is finalized and there's a smooth exit in March, leading to a two-year transition and trade talks, pound bulls such as Eurizon SLJ Capital, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Nomura International Plc expect the currency could rally to $1.40-$1.55.


Moderate Gains
--------------


The options market paints a different picture. Out of total notional bets of around 58 billion pounds since Nov. 7, there were nearly 37 billion pounds in calls. But more than half of those have a strike price between $1.30 and $1.35. Only 2% of the total were on bets for sterling rising above $1.40.


That may suggest current market pricing has factored in a few headwinds for the U.K. economy after the divorce. Most strategists see a second wind for the currency only if the Bank of England hikes interest rates in 2019.


Brexit Outlook: Not So Bleak
----------------------------


A failure to reach a divorce agreement by year-end could see the pound plunge to $1.20, say Credit Agricole and MUFG. Woodman Asset Management AG has an even more negative view. The firm sees it sliding to $1.10 if a second referendum is called.


Yet less than 1% of the total options since Nov. 7, when the pound starting falling on worries about the deal, is on structures that get profitable below $1.15, data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation show.

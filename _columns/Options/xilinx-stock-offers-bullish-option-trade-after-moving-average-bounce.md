Xilinx stock recently pulled back from a high around 112 and perfectly respected the rising 50-day moving average. That means **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) is in a good setup for a bullish options play.




The great thing about options is that you can take directional exposure without risking too much capital.


One way to do that is via a bullish option trade known as a bull call spread.


Xilinx Stock: Option Trade
--------------------------


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy. It's created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to October expiration, a 105 strike call option was trading yesterday around $4 and a 110 call was around $2.05.

Buying the 105 call and selling the 110 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $195 and the maximum profit potential would be $305 (difference in strike prices less the premium paid).


If Xilinx closes below 105 on October 16, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $195 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 110, so no matter how high Xilinx stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $305.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to Xilinx stock using options.

Setting A Stop Loss
-------------------


For a trade like this, I would give the stock a couple of dollars tolerance below the 50-day moving average, which currently sits around 100. So a stop loss around 97-98 makes sense.

It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

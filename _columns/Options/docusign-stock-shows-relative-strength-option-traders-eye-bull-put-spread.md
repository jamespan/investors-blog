DocuSign stock is the top-rated stock in IBD's enterprise software group because of strong fundamentals and technicals.




**DocuSign**'s ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) are the highest possible at 99, giving it a spot in the IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks. The e-signature leader is also a [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com) stock. The stock was added to Leaderboard in early June when it gapped above its 200-day moving average after reporting strong earnings.


DocuSign Stock Option Trade
---------------------------


DocuSign stock on Tuesday broke out above resistance to a new high. Traders that expect this strength to continue could look at a bull put spread option trade.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.



Selling the August 290 put and buying the 285 put would create a bull put spread.


This spread was trading for around $1.65 yesterday. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $165 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $335.


That represents a 49.25% return on risk between now and Aug. 20 if DocuSign stock remains above 290.


If DocuSign stock closes below 285 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $335.


Break-Even Point
----------------


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 288.35 which is calculated as 290 less the $1.65 option premium per contract.


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 5 which means it is a similar exposure to owning 5 shares of DocuSign stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1.65 to $3.30, I would consider closing early for a loss.


With earnings set for early September, this trade should have no earnings risk.


Remember options are risky. Investors can lose 100% of their investment.

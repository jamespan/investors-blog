Tesla stock is nearly back at new high territory after a steady rise the last two months. With earnings due after the close Wednesday, investors may be turned off at the idea of entering a position here. Who knows which way it will go? With an iron condor option strategy, the direction doesn't matter.




Iron Condor For Tesla Stock
---------------------------


Iron Condors are a popular strategy among option traders and are simply a combination of a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/with-goldman-sachs-trading-well-this-options-strategy-offers-a-quick-19-percent-return/) and a [bear call spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/options-strategy-offers-16-profit-on-oil-etf-as-sector-rally-could-be-cooling/). So, is it bullish or bearish? Neither. The trade aims to make a profit from stable stock prices and/or a drop in implied volatility the direction usually doesn't matter.


Typically before earnings, implied volatility rises due to the uncertainty around the earnings announcement. Take **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA))**.** Options expiring on Oct. 22 have an implied volatility of around 54%. That's much higher than normal due to the earnings call scheduled after the close on Wednesday.


Following the last six earnings releases, TSLA stock has moved lower fives times, but stayed within the [expected range](https://www.investors.com/research/options/use-options-to-gauge-how-much-bank-stocks-will-move-on-earnings/) each time.


Setting Up The Trade
--------------------


Remember, the iron condor is simply a bull put spread and bear call spread.


Let's first take the bull put spread. Using the Oct. 22 expiry on TSLA stock, we could sell the 820 put and buy the 810 put. That spread sold for around $1.35 at Tuesday's close.


Next, the bear call spread could be placed by selling the 910 call and buying the 920 call on Tesla stock. This spread sold for around $1.15.


In total, the iron condor at these prices generates around $2.50 in premium.


When trading an iron condor over earnings, traders are expecting the stock to stay within a range between the short put and the short call. For this example on Tesla stock that's between 820 and 910.



Profit And Loss Areas
---------------------


The profit zone sits falls between 817.50 and 912.50 for Tesla stock at expiration. You calculate this by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the total premium received.


As both spreads are $10 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 10 — 2.50 x 100 = $750.


Therefore, if we take the premium divided by the maximum risk, this iron condor trade has the potential to return 33.3%.


That's a very enticing return. It would be great if things were as easy as that. However, anything can happen over earnings with Tesla stock and your chances at cutting a loss may vanish quickly. I view trades like this as binary events — either they work, or they don't.


For that reason, traders should realize that losing the full $750 is a distinct possibility. There is also a risk of early assignment if TSLA stock breaks through either 820 or 910.


Newer option traders may want to try this trade out on paper before risking live capital.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

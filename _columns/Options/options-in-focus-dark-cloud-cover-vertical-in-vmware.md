Virtualization software / cloud play outfit **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) is lifting higher Wednesday in late afternoon trade and displaying a bit of oversized relative strength with gains of about 3%. Investor reaction appears to be tied to its multi-day VMworld tradeshow that's currently underway. 

  

For those more grizzly types more impressed with a maybe less-than-perfect looking (which we prefer) weekly head and shoulder pattern, a bear vertical is one option or umm, spread to consider.

  

Ideally, a pivot high for a still developing right shoulder could crest near prior key highs of 98 and its 62% retracement level. But, with today's highs piercing the 50% mark and 50-day simple moving average and then falling back below those levels, a high for the anticipated lower right shoulder could be in place.

  

  

One vertical that makes sense based on attention to the technicals and stop losses paid to a breaking of the potential pattern would be the September 97.5 / 100 bear call spread. Priced for just more than $0.80 per spread, the risk graph shown above illustrates sizing of 5 contracts. This amounts to maximum dollar exposure of $840 or just more than 4% using a $20K model portfolio. 

  

Tying in a managed pre-expiration stop loss on price action above the 98 to 99 area would cut down the loss to roughly 1% as is annotated on the chart. In having to take such action, while this bear wouldn't exactly be on Cloud 9, he or she would certainly be keeping their head out of the clouds and where getting really burned looks mostly preventable.

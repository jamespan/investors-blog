Oil investors traded a record number of bullish options contracts for benchmark U.S. crude, a signal that the market is positioning for a potential OPEC deal to limit production and boost prices.


The total volume of calls giving investors the right purchase West Texas intermediate crude rose to the equivalent of 303 million barrels on Tuesday, according to preliminary CME Group data compiled by Bloomberg. That far exceeded a prior record of 221 million, set five and a half years ago. The heaviest trade was concentrated in the first half of next year, with several individual contracts setting all-time highs.


"There is definitely somebody that thinks that there is a risk of having higher prices in the first half of 2017," Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland, said by phone. "It's saying that somebody in the market is either hedging for potential higher prices in 2017, or somebody is taking a bet that prices will be higher next year."


Oil prices on Tuesday had the biggest one-day surge since April as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries embarked on a final diplomatic effort to secure an oil-cuts deal. Its top official is heading on a tour of member states while Russia scheduled informal talks in Doha this week with nations including Saudi Arabia. The producer club, meeting formally on Nov. 30 in Vienna, is under pressure to formalize a deal it set out in September that's supposed to limit supply.


The surge in calls trading also helped lift the total number of lots traded to an all time high. A total of 434,879 were transacted, the preliminary data show. The prior all-time high was 430,867 contracts, set in May 2011. Each one represents 1,000 barrels. Of the 10 most active contracts on Tuesday, nine were calls.


West Texas intermediate for December jumped 5.7% to $45.81 on the Nymex on Tuesday. The advance was the largest since April 8. The grade was down 39 cents at $45.42 at 10:06 a.m. in London.

Facebook stock has traded in a narrow range between 260 and 295 for the best part of two months.




The Bollinger Bands (a statistical chart that characterizes prices and volatility), meanwhile, are near the narrowest level we have seen in around six months.


A lot of times when a stock goes through a period of price compression like the one now seen in **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)), it then experiences a breakout.


That could be a [bullish breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) or a bearish breakout. We don't know. But as options traders we can set up a trade that will profit no matter which way the stock breaks out — as long as it breaks out.


The strategy I'm talking about is called a long straddle. You can construct it through buying an [at-the-money call](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) and an-at-the-money put.


Buying at-the-money options can be expensive. They will also suffer from time decay. This means they will lose a little bit of value with each day that passes if the stock doesn't make a big move.


Facebook Stock And The Long Straddle Trade
------------------------------------------


With a long straddle in Facebook stock, the further out in time the trade is placed, the slower the time decay, but the options are more expensive and require more capital. For long straddles I usually go out about three to four months and then look to close the trade halfway through if the profit target or stop loss have not been hit. This helps to minimize the time decay which gets more severe the closer the trade gets to expiration.


You could consider placing a long straddle in Facebook stock by buying a March-expiring monthly call and put with a 280 strike price. The March 19-expiring call was trading on Friday around $22.40 and the put around $22. When we add the two together, the total cost of the trade would be around $44.40 per contract or $4,400.


This is the total amount of risk in the trade and the maximum that could be lost.


The break-even prices are calculated by taking the strike price plus and minus the cost of the straddle.


Where The Trade Breaks Even
---------------------------



That gives us break-even prices of 235.60 and 324.40, but profits can be made with a smaller move if the move comes earlier in the trade.


For example, the estimated break-even prices at the end of December are 250 and 302.


Changes to implied volatility will have a big impact on this trade and the interim break-even prices, so it's important to have a solid understanding of volatility before placing a trade like this.


Volatility And Risk
-------------------


Facebook stock currently has an implied volatility of 34%, toward the lower end of the 12-month range.


The worst-case scenario with this FB long straddle would be a stable stock price. The call and put slowly lose value each day. For a long straddle, I usually set a stop loss at around 20% of capital at risk, or around $880 in this case.


One thing to keep in mind with this trade is the [earnings date for Facebook stock](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), normally occurring in the last few days of January. Once the earnings numbers have been released, these options could drop in value because the uncertainty surrounding the earnings release is removed.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Spreads such as the bull call vertical can be a great way to reduce the cost of directional position versus an outright purchase. So, how about if you use that advantage with the seemingly good characteristic of extra time for positioning? Well, before you decide to rush out and buy into a longer-term vertical for what quite often looks like some seemingly innocuous amount of extra coin compared to a vertical closer to expiring. Just do remember you really do pay for that time in more than one way.

  

Bottom line, the longer out in time one goes, the more difficult it is to see an option's extrinsic or time value drop off completely. And for a spread like a vertical this means its ability to expand towards its maximum worth prior to expiration is very difficult barring a significant move well beyond the higher short strike.

  

As much, traders need to be aware of this potential negative characteristic with longer-term verticals. If a trader has been overly fixated on how much more time he or she might have to remain in the position for just a tiny bit more capital, there could be some unintended feelings of having been cheated when the stock cooperates a bit more than planned.

  

To illustrate let's look at situation in the **iShares Silver** ([SLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLV)) product comparing the August 38 / 41 bull call spread versus the October 38 / 41 bull call from back in mid July as the stock traded near 38 a share. The former and near-term spread was priced at $1.05, while the latter October vertical with its extra 63 days on the calendar cost just ten additional cents or $1.15 per spread. That sounds quite reasonable, right? So what gives?

  

  

Well if a picture can speak a thousand words, when we look above at the comparison of the two verticals using four contracts, we have a bit more understanding of why a dime for your time could be a costly one or at least a bit aggravating at times. 

  

In the end or at least the interim sometimes, if the vertical trader doesn't appreciate the negative aspect of time on these types of spreads, the difference in the here and now can prove disappointing and less of a good but still profitable deal should that bull move faster and more aggressively than expected.

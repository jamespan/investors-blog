Our purpose isn't to serve daily notice of how options when used properly and compared to stock can keep catastrophe from occurring in one's portfolio. Not that we mind tackling that job on occasion when duty calls. In Thursday's session that obligation looks very apparent with **F5 Networks**' ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) earnings fallout, which brutalized shares more than 20% after hours. 

  

The soon-to-be axed No. 4 IBD 50 component, as well as a "FADSCAN" constituent at Mad Money brutalized growth bulls Thursday with its below-to-bracketing guidance for its upcoming second quarter. 

  

In the end using a 7% to 8% stop loss and or 50-day simple moving average or any host of other well-intentioned attempts at money management failed miserably. The only hard stop in shares of a stock is ultimately $0.00, however unlikely that might be. 

  

On the other hand, a simple long put or long call, as well as a host of other spread opportunities available to option traders, offer definitive protection. The end result may not be pretty but if bulls or bears for that matter like the idea of real security; then that or those options are worth checking out. 

  

To be certain, while bulls trading yesterday's most fancied and richly priced calls, the January 150s for $1.85 per contract or the very well-traded April 160s for around $5.05 aren't exactly happy campers today; at least today's fallout didn't become a more unexpected rude awakening due to a sometimes and often enough mad money market. 

  

  

Shown above and to illustrate a bullish limited risk strategy siding with a handful of optimistic upgrades and reiterations from the likes of Credit Suisse, Gleacher and Wedbush while also appreciating FFIV's likely overhead resistance; is a February 105 / 115 bull call on two contracts. 

  

Given the magnitude of today's fallout which looks to put shares in an oversold position the idea would be to adjust the position into a long call condor or some kind of long butterfly if bargain hunters stepped in and pushed FFIV back up by maybe 3% to 5%. And if they don't, well it's nice to know that bottom-line, the real bottom-line is $4.00 per position.

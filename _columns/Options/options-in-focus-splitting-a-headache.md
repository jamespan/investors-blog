  Options In Focus: Splitting a Headache

Have you ever found yourself wanting to adjust and ratchet down the risk in an open stock position which has provided nice size profits with options? But upon looking at the available calls and puts you're unable to formulate a way to satisfy your money management and trend-riding disciplines at the same time? One solution to consider is splitting strike prices to get rid of that potential headache, albeit a nice one to have all things considered. 

  

To illustrate, we're going to look at **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) while shares were toying with fresh all-time-highs in December following a nice price run of about 33% from the market's September follow-through day signal. 

  

Let's suppose Trader Bud Fox was a bit late on the inside skinny of the market's FTD. Mr. Fox opted to wait for additional confirmation of strength and purchased 400 shares of AAPL at $275 as it tested prior highs and appeared headed towards the magical century mark of $300. 

  

Fast forward to the days immediately in front of Christmas and young Bud finds himself up about 50 points or a bit less than 20%. That's not exactly a gainer like **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) back in the day or maybe Gordon Gekko's score in Anacott Steel, for that matter. Nonetheless, feeling uneasy about giving profits back, but also unwilling to give up on Apple's trend just yet; Bud decides collaring his position might be the answer. 

  

Looking at the option prices offered that day with shares at $325, that queasy feeling returns. Strikes on AAPL stock are at ten point intervals and premiums for ATM protection look inflated due to the stock's triple digit price tag and fairly stiff relationship between implieds and much lower statistical movement. 

  

His solution? Bud decides to use a split strike variation of the collar strategy. Giving himself a little bit of percentage wiggle room to keep his position in tune with underlying volatility, Bud uses the January 300 and 310 puts and January 340 and 350 calls for essentially even money. 

  

In essence this splitting of strikes gives Bud a reasonable collar proxy with protection at the non-existent 305 strike. It's not exactly perfect as the risk graph suggests with its slight anomaly in the expiration profit line.

  

The adjustment amounts to Bud making, at a minimum, the difference between his purchase price of $275 and roughly $305 on 400 shares. And if brokers Kaufmann, Piper and the likely legions of other bullish calls out there around that time proved presciently correct; there's still nice profit before the call caps Bud's upside. Of course too, Bud's a savvy enough guy to consider the option, pardon the pun, of re-hedging, should that day come to bear fruit.

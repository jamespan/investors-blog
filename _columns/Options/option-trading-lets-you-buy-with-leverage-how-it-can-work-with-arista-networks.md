**Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) stock continues to look strong and was added to the [IBD 50](https://www.investors.com/research/aal-stock-anet-flyw-tkr-and-ttd-are-new-tickers-on-the-ibd-50-hot-list/) last week.




According to the IBD Stock Checkup, ANET stock is ranked number 2 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 98 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 89.


Investors who think ANET stock will continue to rally and don't want to risk significant capital can use long call options rather than buy the stock outright. This can be a good way to protect precious capital in these volatile markets.


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (the strike price) up until a certain date (the expiration date).


Option Trading With Leverage
----------------------------


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage. (This can be both a good and a bad thing.)


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of ANET stock, he or she would have to invest around $16,200 at the current price.



Instead, the investor could gain a similar exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option. One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.


If an investor were to buy one ANET 160-strike call option expiring on Dec. 15, the amount needed to invest would be around $1,870, rather than $16,200.


The break-even price for this call option is equal to the strike price plus the premium paid. That would make the break-even price 178.70.


The most the trade can lose is the premium paid of $1,870, which would occur if ANET finished below 160 on Dec. 15.


Option Trading: Call Has Unlimited Upside
-----------------------------------------


However, if Arista stock shoots higher, the upside is unlimited.


Using options in this way can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock without risking as much capital as would be required to buy the stock outright.


Savvy traders can further reduce the risk by selling an out-of-the-money call, turning the trade into a bull call spread.


For example, selling the Dec. 15, 180 call would reduce the trade cost by around $980, but would also limit the upside above 180.


A stop loss could be set if Arista drops 8% from the entry point.

A number of interesting, albeit contrarian trades have emerged in a once-hot asset class. That asset? Gold.




At one point this year, gold prices were up a staggering 40%. Now, they've given up half that gain.


Despite being up only 20% in the past year, the yellow metal has still done better than the S&P 500 index, which is only up 16% over the past year.


Over a two-year period, the S&P 500 is up 33%. Gold, however, has still beaten that basket of stocks with a 47% rise.


In short, gold is in a long-term uptrend. Its recent weakness is due to several factors.


First, major geopolitical uncertainty is off the table now that the U.S. presidential elections are over. Gold tends to attract interest as a "safe haven" trade, including in times of geopolitical uncertainty. The election outcome, which suggests political gridlock, is an outcome least likely to foster any major changes that may spook markets.


Secondly, gold's rise occurred in part due to massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. The fiscal measures started phasing out at the end of September, with more programs set to also end at the end of 2020. Not surprisingly, gold prices peaked in August, right around the time when plans for further stimulus started to stall out.


While gold has been falling, the past month has seen speculators exit their trades. From mining stocks to the metal itself, there's been a rush for the exits.


An Options Trade As Good As Gold
--------------------------------


That's created oversold conditions. The SPDR Gold ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) itself is looking oversold based on its relative strength index, something more associated with a tech stock that missed earnings than a fund that holds physical bullion.


With the prospect of further stimulus rising, plus the unknowns of how quickly a Covid-19 vaccine can be rolled out and how effective it will prove to be, traders may want to look at gold. Yes, it continues in a long-term uptrend despite being oversold now.


Traders looking for a contrarian play should bet on a rebound in prices in the coming weeks. There are two attractive opportunities to do so.


The most bullish bet: Traders looking for a quick bounce can simply buy call options on the SPDR Gold ETF itself. The February 170-strike price calls trade at-the-money, offering traders a lower-risk of losing capital relative to buying an out-of-the-money call.


They traded Tuesday at about $5.85. Should gold prices rise quickly, traders would benefit from both a quick bounce in the ETF from here as well as rising implied volatility for gold-related options in general.


These options have shed about two-thirds of their value since gold started to decline in earnest in November. On a partial rebound in the ETF off oversold levels, traders should look for mid-double-digit gains from these options. For this trade, consider a price target of about $8.80, for a profit just over 50%.


Remember, gold prices can be fickle, and a surge back to gold's all-time high from August is unlikely in the next few weeks. That's why a [bull call spread](https://www.investors.com/videos/options-trading-strategies-bull-call-spread/) may be the more attractive play here.


Buy A Call And Sell A Call
--------------------------


Another strategy is a hedged bullish bet: Traders could still buy the February 170 calls for about $5.85 per share. But they would also sell the February 180 calls. Those calls traded Tuesday for about $2.67.


By using this strategy, traders would reduce their out-of-pocket cost from $5.85, or $585 per contract, to just $318, by receiving $267 in income for each contract of the $180 calls that were sold. Traders would profit on a rise in GLD between 170 and 180. If GLD prices dropped further, traders would have a loss, but a lower one than if they simply bought the 170 calls.


With a bull call spread, profits would be capped at the 180 price on GLD. In terms of risk, there's one potential land mine to avoid. If GLD trades over the strike price of 170, a trader will be assigned shares, which entails an extensive amount of capital. Look to close the trade out before expiration to avoid that scenario.

A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.




Usually this is done with monthly options, but it can also be done with weekly options. Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they would use puts.


In today's example, we'll look at a calendar spread trade on **McDonald's** ([MCD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MCD)) stock.


With McDonald's stock trading around 194, setting up a calendar spread at 195 gives the trade a neutral outlook.


Selling the Aug. 21-expiring call option with a 195 strike price will generate around $380 in premium, and buying the Sept. 18 call will cost around $590.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $210 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is $250, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


Sold Option Decays Faster Than Bought Option
--------------------------------------------


The idea with the trade is that if McDonald's stock remains around 195 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay in value at a faster rate than the bought option, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.



The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 189 and 201, but these can also change slightly depending on the impact of changes in implied volatility.


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


For a trade like this, I would set a profit target of 25% and I would set a stop loss if McDonald's stock breaks through either 189 or 201. And I would risk not more than 2% or 3% of my capital.


Calendar spreads are a neutral option trading strategy. Bullish traders might consider something simpler like [a bull call spread, similar to a trade in Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tesla-options-bulls-can-double-down-with-this-option-play/) or a [cash secured put on Delta stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/delta-stock-how-to-trade-cash-secured-put-option/).


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

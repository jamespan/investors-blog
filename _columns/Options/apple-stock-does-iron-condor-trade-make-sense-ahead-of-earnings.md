Iron Condors are a popular strategy among option traders and are simply a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. And one could make sense for Apple stock ahead of Thursday's earnings report.




The trade aims to make a profit from stable stock prices and / or a drop in implied volatility.


In the lead up to earnings, implied volatility rises due to the uncertainty around the earnings announcement.


Taking **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) as an example, options expiring on July 31 have an implied volatility of around 53%. That's much higher than normal due to the earnings call scheduled for July 30.


When trading an iron condor over earnings, traders are expecting the stock to stay within a range between the short put and the short call.


Apple Stock: Iron Condor
------------------------


Let's look at an example for Apple stock just ahead of earnings.


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the July 31 expiry, we could sell the 360 put and buy the 355 put. That spread could be sold for around $1.05 using yesterday's closing prices.


Then the bear call spread for Apple stock could be placed by selling the 390 call and buying the 395 call. This spread could be sold for around $0.70.


In total, the iron condor for Apple stock would have generated around $1.75 in premium.


The profit zone for Apple stock sits between 358.25 and 391.75. This can be calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the total premium received.


As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 — 1.75 x 100 = $325


Solid Return
------------


Therefore, if we take the premium divided by the maximum risk, this iron condor trade for Apple stock has the potential to return 53.84%.


That's a very nice return and it would be great if things were as easy as that. However, anything can happen over earnings and I view trades like this as binary events — either they work, or they don't.


For that reason, traders should realize that losing the full $325 is a distinct possibility. Just make sure to paper trade this type of trade before risking live capital.

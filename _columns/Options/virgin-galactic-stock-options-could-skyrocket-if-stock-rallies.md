After the historic [SpaceX launch over the weekend](https://www.investors.com/news/spacex-launch-commercial-crew-dragon-astronauts-international-space-station/), there has been a huge focus on **Virgin Galactic Holdings** ([SPCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPCE)), with traders wondering if this company can also reach for the stars.




Today I've got a fun options trade for you that is a high-risk/high-reward trade. I view these ideas as lottery trades — risk a little to potentially win a lot but knowing full well the chances of winning are slim.


Virgin Galactic stock was as high as 42.50 earlier in the year but is currently languishing at 16.


Let's dare to dream that Virgin Galactic stock can get back to those lofty heights sometime this year. The best way to play that opinion is with long calls.


Looking out to January 2021, the 30 strike-price calls are trading around $2.80.


Those calls will skyrocket in value if Virgin Galactic can make a big rally in the next few months. If Virgin Galactic stock were to get back to 40 by the end of September, those calls would be worth around $15.



That's a huge gain, but you have to ask: How likely is that to happen?


Probably fairly unlikely, so I view this trade as a fun trade and would not risk more than 1% of my account value on it, knowing full well that the trade will likely lose 100%.


With all the negative news in the world at the moment, it's nice to take a gamble on humanity progressing and achieving something amazing.

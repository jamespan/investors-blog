With IBD's market outlook moving to [uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-falls-to-key-levels-these-sectors-remain-interesting/), investors need to be more picky buying stocks. **Foot Locker** ([FL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FL)) is one stock breaking out above resistance and trading above the [21-](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), [50-](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and 200-day moving averages.




A cash-secured put is a slightly less bullish trade than buying the stock. It is considered a neutral to slightly bullish trade.


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start out with options. They are very similar to a covered call and are quite easy to understand once you know the basics.


It's important that anyone selling puts understands that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


Let's take a look at an example using Foot Locker stock.


With the stock trading at 61.31, investors could sell a June 18-expiring put with a strike price of 60 for around $3.50.


An investor selling this put would receive $350 into their account, which would be theirs to keep. If FL stock falls below 60 by June 18, investors would be forced to buy 100 shares at 60. The effective net cost of the position would be $56.50 thanks to the option premium received.

That's 7.85% below Tuesday's closing price.


If the stock stays above 60 at expiry, the put expires worthless, leaving the trader with a healthy 6.19% return on capital at risk.



The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. That is, if the stock falls precipitously, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the loss will be partially offset by the premium received for selling the put.


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if Foot Locker stock fell to zero, which would see the trade lose $5,650, but most traders would cut losses long before then.


Cash-secured puts are a wonderful way to generate a healthy return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership.


If the put does get assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base and can potentially begin selling covered calls to generate further income from the position.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

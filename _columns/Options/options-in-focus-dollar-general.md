IBD 50 constituent and discount variety store operator **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) staged a base-on-base breakout today. Shares finished up less than 1% to 48.91. The deep-discount retailer looked to have benefited from a stronger-than-forecast same-store-sales report, which featured frugal shopping as tops with cost-minded consumers. 

  

Option traders appear to have taken notice of Thursday's potential breakout. Daily average volume of about 450 contracts surged to more than 2,200. Of notice and obviously dollar fragile in their own right, traders concentrated their efforts on the front month, slightly out-of-the-money June 50 call. 

  

Volume of 1,100 in the call compares to existing open interest of 1,200. As much and with pricing under modest pressure, it's difficult to say with absolute authority that traders were net opening buyers of the call contract. However, given a buy point entry less than half percent away and upside of just 5% required of shares to turn it into a double of $1.80; the logic behind this type of entry makes sense enough. 

  

There are risks of course. The two threatening this type purchase are the contract is still fully out of the money and it has the increasing threat of time decay with just 14 days or two trading weeks left in its life. Nonetheless, as the bulk of today's activity got in paying slightly cheaper between $0.80 to $0.85 and the vast majority smaller lot sizes with five contracts a popular choice; we're slightly more appreciative of today's efforts which also looks to have an eye on risk management. And given earnings are slated for this coming Monday after the close of trade, this kind of limited risk speculation makes added sense and cents at the same time.

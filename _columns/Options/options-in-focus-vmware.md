Shares IBD 50 constituent **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) bucked the broader averages today, much to the chagrin of existing shareholders and price action which option traders took notice of. Topping off our unusual volume cheat sheet, VMW saw more than 20,000 contracts change hands compared to its 150-day simple moving average of 3,400. 

  

Technically, shares of VMW broke decisively below its 10-day simple moving average for the first time since its December corrective lows, but managed to find support from its longer-term 50-day simple moving average which had gone untested since late January. 

  

Reaction today and one which finished with shares off 2.59% in a wide range decision candle known as a doji, was tied to the company's preannounced in-line to slightly above views guidance call following the unexpected departure of its CFO. VMware will officially release its Q1 results next Wednesday evening. 

  

A look at VMware's option activity shows fairly even trading in both its calls and puts with roughly 70% of the overall volume concentrated in the April contract. Implied volatility took a small dip lower on the session given both the removal of some stock-specific uncertainty, as well as the broader market's own small sigh of relief in the CBOE Volatility Index. 

  

  

As earnings fall two days in front of expiration, still well-bid premium is likely to remain intact and probably even move to fresh relative highs. Yet, given the passage of time so close to contract's final days; an earnings or volatility rush play using the likes of an at-the-money long strangle needs to account for the negative impact of time decay for the period held before a more secure decision regarding risk versus reward can be determined. 

  

Shown above and to illustrate those two contrasting factors on option premiums, is a 10x April 105 / 110 strangle for $4.85 using a 20% increase over current implieds and reflecting a clock having ticked down to the last couple days in front of the report. Assuming our volatility estimate is in the ballpark, with risk of about $2,850 compared to max expiration risk of $4,850; I'd personally be giving the benefit of the doubt and the "smiley" nod to the trader on the other side this long curve position.

**Kulicke & Soffa** (KLIC) is one of the [fastest growing companies](https://www.investors.com/research/fastest-growing-stocks-to-watch-2021/), with estimated earnings growth of 339% for the fiscal year ending in September. 




KLIC stock recently pulled back to and successfully tested the 50-day exponential moving average, which is a good sign. It is also forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The chip-equipment company boasts impressive ratings, with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 82 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93. 


One way to take ownership of a stock for less than the share price is via an option strategy called a cash secured put. This is a slightly less bullish trade than buying the stock. It is considered a neutral to slightly bullish trade. 


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price. 


Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start out with options. They are like a covered call and are quite easy to understand once you know the basics. 


Traders selling puts should understand that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price. 


How Cash Secured Put Works With KLIC stock
------------------------------------------


Let's look at an example using Kulicke & Soffa stock. 


With the stock trading at 55.37 Tuesday, investors could sell an Aug. 20-expiring put with a strike price of 55 for around $3.90. 



An investor selling this put would receive $390 into their account, which would be theirs to keep. If KLIC stock falls below 55 by Aug. 20, they would be required to buy 100 shares at 55 each. The effective net cost of the position would be 51.10 thanks to the option premium received. That is 7.7% below Tuesday's closing price. 


If the stock stays above 55 at expiry, the put expires worthless, leaving the trader with a healthy 7.6% return on capital at risk. 


Risk Similar To Owning The Stock
--------------------------------


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. That is, if the stock falls quickly, the trade will suffer a loss; however, the loss will be partially offset by the premium received for selling the put. 


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if Kulicke & Soffa shares fell to zero, which would see the trade lose $5,110, but most traders would cut losses long before then.


Cash secured puts are a great way to generate a healthy return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership. 


If the put does get assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base and can potentially begin selling covered calls to generate further income from the position.

Shares of niche athletics apparel outfit **Lululemon**  ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) 'stretched' their way higher Wednesday. Intraday, the stock was up about 9% as more than a few investors bought into the company's upwardly raised guidance and its intentions to open an additional 20 to 25 stores over the next year.

  

The official call from the pages of Investors.com is LULU shares are "too extended beyond any legitimate buy point" to consider for purchase. That point appears to have been lost on today's crowd on swelling volume though. Maybe the other guy or gal was looking bullishly at a four-week long, "downward bull posing as a bear" pattern of 11% depth; and which may have signaled a bullish reversal within a still under construction base?

  

Time will tell of course but in the interim, one or two things other traders were checking out today were Lululemon's options. Contract volume soared in sympathy from a daily average of around 5,000 to more than 25,000 with calls favored by a 2-to-1 margin on slightly under pressure and overall reasonably priced implieds.

  

Most active with still about an hour left in Wednesday's bullish workout session, the slightly out-of-the money January 75 call has enjoyed healthy volume of about 5,200 and easily eclipsing open interest of 3,149.

  

  

Priced at $1.35 with LULU at 73.40, a long call strategy will require a max move of about 6% over the next seven sessions in order to double in price to $2.70. If other bulls take to a quick square box breakout pose or something along those lines, then slightly lesser upside would be required.

  

Failing that type of maneuver, if even a legitimate formation in the first place; bulls using proper money management and acceptant of a ticking clock and attached theta risks, shouldn't sweat matters too much. However, for the more limber and softer bulls, doing a long and mostly centered, butterfly position looks to be a bit more empowering. *What do you think?

**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) is sitting pretty at No. 1 in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/). So it was no surprise to see the former [Leaderboard play](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) and top growth stock rally more than 6% on Monday.




In the past three weeks, AMD stock has beautifully resisted challenges of support near the [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and looks primed for the next leg of the rally.


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-advanced-micro-devices-amd.aspx), AMD stock is ranked No. 1 in the fabless semiconductor group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 99 and an RS Rating of 97.


While there is no guarantee the rally will continue, a bull call spread is an easy, risk-defined strategy that will benefit from further upside in the stock.

AMD Stock: The Bull Call Spread Trade
-------------------------------------


How do you create a bull call spread?


Buy a call and then sell a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to the Oct. 16-expiration contract, a 95 strike call option traded Monday around $6.50; a 100 call hovered near $5.00.


Buying the 95 call and selling the 100 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $150 and the maximum profit potential would be $350 (difference in strike prices less the premium paid).


An Upside Limit On The Profit
-----------------------------



A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy. So if AMD stock closes below 95 on Oct. 16, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $150 premium paid. Potential gains get capped above 100. So no matter how AMD stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $350.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to AMD stock using options.


In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $1.50 to $0.75 I would consider closing early for a loss. Otherwise, I would hold to expiry or if the spread traded up near $3.00.


Always remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

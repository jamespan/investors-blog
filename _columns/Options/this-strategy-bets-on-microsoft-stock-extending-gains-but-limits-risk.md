**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is showing significant strength and closed just below the 52-week high Wednesday. 




Microsoft stock is No. 1 in the desktop software industry group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 93, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 85. 


One way to get long Microsoft stock while risking less capital is by using options. 


Today, we're going to look at a bullish calendar spread, [similar to one](https://www.investors.com/research/options/as-upstart-stock-hits-new-highs-options-strategy-offers-exposure-with-less-risk/) on cloud-based lending platform **Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) from last month. That trade worked very well, so hopefully this one will be the same. 


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price. 


Setting Up Calendar Spread On Microsoft Stock
=============================================


Traders with a price target of 350 could place the bullish calendar spread at that price. 


Selling the Dec. 17-expiration, 350-strike call option will generate around $280 in premium. And buying the Jan. 21, 350-strike call will cost around $580. 


That results in a net cost for the trade of $300 per spread, which is the most the trade can lose. 


The estimated maximum profit is around $2,250, but that can vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if Microsoft stock trades up to around 350, the calendar spread will increase, resulting in a net profit. 


Spread Offers Exposure With Reduced Risk
----------------------------------------


A bullish calendar spread is a good way to gain some upside exposure on a stock without risking too much if the move doesn't eventuate. 



The ideal scenario is a rise up to 350 around Dec. 17 with little change (or a rise) in implied volatility. 


The combined position has a net delta of 31, which means the trade is roughly equivalent to owning 31 shares of Microsoft stock, although this will change as the trade progresses. 


For a trade such as this, I would set a profit target of 30% and a stop loss of 20%. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

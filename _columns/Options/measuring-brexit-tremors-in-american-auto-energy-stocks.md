Apprehension that Britons will vote to secede from the European Union is exerting influence great and small in disparate corners of the U.S. equity market. Here's a map to where.


A YouGov poll for the Times newspaper published late Monday showed "Leave" at 44% and 42% for "Remain," while a survey by ORB for the Daily Telegraph had "Remain" at 53% and "Leave" at 46% once "don't knows" were stripped out. JPMorgan published a list last month of stocks with the highest sensitivity to the Brexit outcome, and that group has been trailing the market of late.


The 22 stocks on the list, which encompasses companies from **PPL Corp.** ([PPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PPL)) to **Invesco** ([IVZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IVZ)), have lagged behind the S&P 500 by an average of 2.2 percentage points in June, with **Penske Automotive Group** ([PAG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PAG)) and **PRA Health** ([PRAH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRAH)) trailing by as much as 9.1 percentage points.


To be sure, the potential impact on U.S. companies is diluted by distance, and it won't be the end of the world for these shares if Brexit goes through, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients last month.


"U.K. subsidiaries of U.S. companies are relatively insulated from potential disruptions" because they "tend to focus more on domestic end markets rather than trade or export out of the U.K." Lakos-Bujas wrote. "We therefore see the fallout from potential disruptions in trade agreements as less significant for their fundamentals."


Among companies with the highest revenue exposure in the U.K., there's still time to hedge risks ahead of Thursday's vote, according to Katherine Fogertey, a derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs. "The options market is not pricing in strong incremental downside to the stocks with the largest exposure to the region," she wrote in a note to clients last week. "It is still attractive to buy puts for many stocks with high U.K. sales exposure."


Among 18 stocks with liquid options and more than 15% of sales from the U.K., the top two candidates are Penske Automotive and PPL, Fogertey wrote. She recommends buying puts of Penske as insurance related to the company's scheduled earnings on July 28 and its U.K. exposure. Similarly, for PPL, a strategy known in the options market as a straddle can be used to hedge for its earnings scheduled for July 28 and the company's large foreign-exchange exposure.


Within U.S.-domiciled companies, there's a lack of consistency when reporting international sales, particularly by region. With the caveat that such reporting is "poor," Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, last week compiled a list of 20 companies in the S&P 500 Index with a high proportion of foreign sales in the U.K. Topping that list are **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)), **Phillips 66** ([PSX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSX)), **Ford Motor** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)), **Walgreens Boots Alliance** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) and **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


Beyond the U.S., Bloomberg has compiled an equally-weighted index of 10 stocks -- including Rolls-Royce Holdings, **Barclays** ([BCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BCS)) and Berkeley Group Holdings -- to track British exposure to the EU across multiple industries. The Bloomberg Brexit Equity Index is down 16% in the past 12 months and is on track for its worst year of performance since 2008.


Most visibly, bookmaker odds tracking prospects for the referendum's defeat have converged with the direction of the broader stock market in recent days.


Odds on the U.K. remaining in the EU have fluctuated from as low as almost 63% a week ago to 79% currently, according to Oddschecker calculations based on bookmakers' quotes. That's more or less aligned directionally with fluctuations in the S&P 500 this month.

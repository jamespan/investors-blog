**Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) is holding nicely above the rising [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and its own [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Plus, the top growth stock recently showed a bullish cross in its MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) price momentum indicator.




[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), APPS stock is ranked No. 1 in the enterprise software group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stocks-to-buy-and-watch-ibd-composite-rating-top-growth-stocks/) of 98, an EPS Rating of 74 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99.


Investors who think APPS stock is due to rally and don't want to risk significant amounts of capital can use long call options rather than buying the stock outright.


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (strike price), up until a certain date (expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage. If you wanted to buy 100 shares of APPS stock, you would have to invest around $8,800 at the current price.


Instead, you could gain a similar exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option.


One call option gives an investor exposure to 100 shares.


How To Trade Options: Think Forward To September
------------------------------------------------



If an investor were to buy 1 APPS call option with a 75 strike price expiring in September 2021, he or she would only need to invest around $2,750 rather than $8,800. If APPS stock goes to $0, the option trader loses only $2,750 while still maintaining a similar exposure to the gains.


The APPS stock 75 call option gives the investor the right to buy 100 APPS shares at 75 up until the expiration date.


The call option recently cost around $27.50 per contract. So the investor would need APPS stock to rise above 102.50 (strike price plus premium paid) to be profitable on the investment.


There is always a risk with trading on leverage like this, of course. If APPS drops below 75 at expiry, the investor will lose 100% of the investment, or $2,750. An investor holding 100 shares on the other hand would lose around $1,300.


Making It Even Less Expensive To Buy APPS Stock
-----------------------------------------------


Savvy traders might consider reducing the cost of the long call by selling also an out-of-the-money call. This reduces the cost but also reduces the gain potential.


For example, the September 110 strike call in APPS stock can be sold for around $11.40 per option contract. That would reduce the cost of the long call by $1,140 but would cap any gains above 110.


Long call options and bull call spreads can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock without risking as much capital as would be required to buy the stock outright.


Options are risky. Never forget that investors can lose 100% of their investment.

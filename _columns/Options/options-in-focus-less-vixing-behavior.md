Despite the S&P 500's very flat finish Monday, it wasn't exactly the kind of action associated with your typical dog days of summer. Following last week's continued corrective dip in excess of 4%, the broad market proxy was actually down about 0.85% to fresh relative lows before reversing in the second half of trade.

  

So, is now the time to hunt for bargains? While there are no guarantees, we do like what we're seeing in The VIX and the market's most notorious barometer of investor sentiment. Inversely correlated, Monday witnessed the VIX gaining about 4% intraday and striking fresh fearful highs of 27.73% only to reverse and trade down 3.34% at 25.77%. 

  

Overall, our view is the action in The VIX is enticing for faster money traders looking to bottom fish. "Enticing" is an opinion, but one grounded in more quantitative, mean-reverting tendencies of the euphemistically called fear gauge. This type action can be appreciated historically with the never-to-be-tested boundary of zero, which might only be approached during the most absolute, picture perfect times of investor bliss. The actual low is 8.6% from 2006. 

  

On the opposite side of the coin and during times of panic, a physical number attached to fear still falls well below infinity. The greatest investor goosing in our lifetimes offered a reading near 174% back during the stock market crash in 1987. 

  

More recently and during the height of the current credit crisis, The VIX challenged investors with a reading near 90%. However, most panics resolve themselves closer to the 30% level than not. Ultimately, those readings are attached at the hip to implieds, which are based on the underlying statistical movement in the S&P 500. 

  

Short-term mean reversion can be approached by monitoring the relationship between the VIX and its 10-day simple moving average. We often refer to this as "the stretch" or "differential." When readings in excess of 15% occur, the market is showing extreme relative behavior that's prone, but not guaranteed, to revert back towards the short-term average, so conditions might neutralize. 

  

In applying what's been said about the VIX, Monday's highs of 27.73% have come fairly close to the longer-term 30% level associated with panics of days gone by. Further, we've also seen a pair of attractive back-to-back short-term fearful stretches in excess of 15%, which for contrarian purposes, beats having just one day of relative fear. Finally and in the most recent couple of hours, some of that anxiety has clearly abated as evidenced by the VIX's bearish closing doji on its daily chart.

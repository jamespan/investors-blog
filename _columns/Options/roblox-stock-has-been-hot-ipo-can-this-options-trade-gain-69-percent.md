Roblox stock has only been trading on the stock market since mid-March. And in that time, it has been a very volatile stock. That's not uncommon for a [new IPO](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ipo-leaders/).




Volatility on **Roblox** ([RBLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBLX)) is sitting around 68%; that exceeds the implied volatility in stocks like **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) or **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).


One trade worth looking at is an iron condor. When volatility is high, the iron condor can be placed further out-of-the-money, giving the trade a decent chance at success.


Let's look at an example using RBLX stock.


Setting Up The Iron Condor In Roblox Stock

As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/nvidia-stock-and-options-trading-can-this-bull-put-spread-deliver/) and a bear call spread. The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction.


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the July 16 expiry, we could sell the 80 put and buy the 75 put. That spread could be sold Tuesday for around $1.35. Then you could place the bear call spread by selling the 110 call and buying the 115 call. This spread could be sold yesterday for around $0.70.


In total, the iron condor will generate around $2.05 in premium.



The profit zone ranges from 77.95 to 112.05. Calculate it by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 – 2.05 x 100 = $295. Therefore, if we take the premium ($205) divided by the maximum risk ($295), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 69.5%. If price action stabilizes, then iron condors will work well. However, if RBLX stock continues to bounce around, the trade will suffer losses.


Controlling Risk
----------------


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $205 so could set a stop loss at 1.5 times the premium, or around $307.


Always remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

There is nothing worse than making a new stock purchase and then watching the stock swiftly move to the downside.




Thankfully, we can use options to speed up the recovery process on a stock that has dropped. The strategy we will look at today is called a stock repair strategy.


The idea with the stock repair strategy is that the investor can reduce the break-even price without adding any more capital to the trade. There is no additional downside risk with the trade.


Let's look at an example using a stock that has been under pressure in recent months — **Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)).


Assuming a trader was unlucky enough to buy 100 shares of Disney stock at 130, they would be sitting on a considerable loss with the stock closing at 107.33 on Friday.


Traders would need the stock to recover to 130 to get back to break-even.


However, by using options we can lower the break-even price to 210, without adding any extra risk to the trade.


Here's how it can be done:


Buy one September 120 call at 4.45


Sell two September 125 calls at 3.15


Buying the 120 call costs $445 and selling two of the 125 calls receives a credit of $630. The net result for placing the trade is a $185 credit.


Because the trade is placed for a credit, there is no additional risk to the downside. If Disney stock stays below 120, the call options expire worthless, and the trader still owns the 100 shares of stock.


Break-Even Price For Disney Stock Reduced
-----------------------------------------


The break-even price has also been reduced to 124.


If the stock ends up between 120 and 125, the combined stock repair strategy will outperform the pure stock position. 



The trade-off is that any potential gains above 125 are lost. 


Today you have learned that the stock repair strategy is ideal for an investor who is holding a losing stock who simply wants to get back to break-even and get out.


It can help the investor reduce their break-even price for little or no cost.


The strategy does not protect the investor from further downside, but it may be a more attractive proposition than doubling down.


When placing the stock repair strategy, the investor is giving up any potential upside on the stock.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

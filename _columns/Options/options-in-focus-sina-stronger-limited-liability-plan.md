When those classic chart reads just aren't working, it's nice to know that no matter how bad or adverse conditions might become—that the option to limit that risk is there with spread strategies using calls and puts. On that pressing subject matter, we can, much to our chagrin, dutifully follow up on a potential top and attached three-way "controlled" risk reversal discussed last night on **Sina.com** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)). 

  

We won't bore readers to tears with the background from Wednesday's article as that can be read easily enough by going into the archives. However, the technical basis for establishing the bear call / long put combo was put into question today, if not fully quashed, depending on which technician one might ask. As for me, Thursday's bullish engulfing price action which pierced Wednesday's bearish shooting star despite the market's own broad-based sell-off is enough to say "SINAyara!!"

  

  

The good news and as shown above, with limited-risk strategies, exiting prior to expiration when the position proves to be an immediate paper loss, is that most often you can reduce one's maximum allowable loss by sticking to the original plan of where you'd exit, if proven incorrect. In truth, that's not necessarily all that different than if a trader had simply used stock and then bailed under similar trying conditions. However, this doesn't preclude the possibility for those other occasions when the mad money turns really mad, or in this case, super mad or glad—and leaving bears of all types with less of a leg to stand on, though we'd still take the bear using three legs instead of one.

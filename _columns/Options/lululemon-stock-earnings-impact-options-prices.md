**Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) tumbled 7.4% on Wednesday despite [beating expectations on its earnings release](https://www.investors.com/news/lululemon-stock-lululemon-earnings/). Here's what happened with the Lululemon stock options.




Lululemon Stock Expected Price Move
-----------------------------------


Leading into the earnings call for Lululemon, the options market was pricing in a 10.2% move in either direction. Even though LULU stock fell 7.4%, it was less than the expected move.


The expected move is calculated by taking the price of the at-the-money call and the at-the-money put for the expiration immediately after the earnings date.


Before the Lululemon earnings announcement, the at-the-money strike was 350. At the Sept. 11 expiration, the 350 call was trading at 17.95 and the 350 put was trading at 17.90.


If we add the two together, we get 35.85.


Then we divide 35.85 by the stock price of 350 and that gives 10.2%. This gives you the expected move of Lululemon stock in the lead-up to earnings based on options pricing.


Earnings And Implied Volatility
-------------------------------


The other interesting thing to note is that due to the huge drop in implied volatility following the announcement, some of the Sept. 11 puts actually dropped in value.


You might think that with Lululemon stock taking a dive, all puts would go through the roof. That's not always the case.


Here's what happened Wednesday for LULU stock puts:

Some of the puts increased in value, but others dropped, in some cases quite significantly.


Something to keep an eye on for next earnings season.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

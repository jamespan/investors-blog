It's another big week of earnings with companies like **Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), **Shopify** ([SHOP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHOP)), **Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)), **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) and **Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) all reporting earnings.




In the past few weeks we've looked at some bull put spread ideas like [this one](https://www.investors.com/research/options/dis-stock-earnings-bull-put-spread/) and [this one](https://www.investors.com/research/options/amzn-stock-bull-put-spread-looks-capture-volatility-premium/).


Today, I want to take a look at **ROKU** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) stock.


ROKU stock is currently above the 21-day, [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and 200-day moving averages and showing nice accumulation.


The downside with ROKU stock is the low [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 30, but it does have a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 93 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96.


ROKU earnings are set for Thursday after the close with the consensus for a loss of 8 cents per share on revenue of $615.84 million.


The options market is pricing in a 13.1% move in the stock in either direction.



Implied volatility is elevated at 80.8%, which puts it in the 76th percentile of all readings in the last 12 months.


High volatility results in high option premiums which can be good for bull put spread traders.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish ROKU Stock Option Trade**
-----------------------------------


Traders who think ROKU stock will rally or at least not drop by too much could look to sell a Feb. 19 450 put and buy a Feb. 19 445 put.


As of Friday, this spread was trading for around $2.30 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $230 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $270.


That represents a potential 85.19% return on risk in four days as long as ROKU stock remains above 450.


If ROKU stock closes below 445 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $270.


With this being such a short-term trade, there is no chance to adjust the trade if it goes bad. Trading options over earnings can be risky so keeping position size small is a good idea.


I view these as fun trades that either work or they don't and you have to be prepared to take the full loss if the stock drops.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

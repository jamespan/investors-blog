**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) has been on fire lately, but could the market leader's epic rally need a little pause here? If so, traders may benefit from a diagonal call spread, an advanced options strategy, in Nvidia stock. 




With the stock looking a little extended, Nvidia might rally a little further, but possibly not too much further. So, in situations like this I like to use a diagonal call spread because it utilizes options over two different expiration periods.


The ideal scenario here? Nvidia stock rallies up to just below the short (sold) call right before expiry.


**Nvidia Stock Today: The Trade**
---------------------------------


It's fairly easy to set up this trade in Nvidia stock. First, sell the March 28-expiration call with a 970 strike price. Next, buy the April 12 1,000 call.


This diagonal spread trade would generate a cost of around $5, or $500 per set of contracts, based on recent trading.


As the trade is placed for a debit, a trader's maximum loss on the downside is equal to the premium paid, or around $500.


The maximum risk for this options trade in Nvidia stock lies on the upside. It equals the difference between the strikes plus the premium paid.


With the strikes being $30 apart, the risk on the upside totals $3,500.


There is a nice profit zone between around 825 and 1,050. One can estimate the maximum potential profit at around $3,600. But the catch is you don't want the Nvidia shares to get to that zone too quickly.

**Managing Risk**
-----------------



In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss if Nvidia stock rallied up above 1,000. As an example, if that were to happen today, the trade might be down around $250.


Investors will be taking a keen interest in the [Nvidia conference](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-chips-amd-stock-vs-nvidia-stock/) taking place in San Jose, Calif., this week. 


Diagonal spreads are an advanced strategy and not recommended for beginner option traders.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Nvidia stock ranks No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 98.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

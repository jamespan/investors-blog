Bottom line, owning a put contract on a one-to-one ratio with long stock guarantees the trader has a concrete stop in place during the time held as part of a married put strategy. While that much is without refute, there are a couple different ways to appreciate just how the combination ensures protection. 

  

The choice of which math one uses in formulating a breakeven for the married put position is more of an apple-to-apple varietal situation for the trader, rather than a gift that's going to actually change your bottom-line. 

  

One popular method of figuring out the math behind the married put and used by brokers is as follows: (Stock Price + Put Premium) — Strike = Risk Basis. This approach stresses the two debits packaged together in relation to the protective strike price where the trader has the right, but not obligation to sell shares. 

  

For instance and to illustrate with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), let's say a trader pays 577.50 for 100 shares while simultaneously buying 1 contract of the June 555 Put for $6.20. Imputing those three variables, we have the following: (577.50 + 6.20) — 555 = (583.70) — 555 = $28.70 of risk or $2,870. 

  

An alternative approach less adhered to, but not necessarily wrong as the trader reaches the same conclusion of what's at stake is: Stock Price — (Strike — Put Premium) = 577.50 — (555 — 6.20) = 577.50 — (548.80) = $28.70 or risk of $2,870. 

  

This process separates the stock purchase price from the trader's ultimate stop loss point or the price of where a naked long put buyer would breakeven. Either way you slice it, you come up with a situation that's less prone to going completely bad quickly.

The S&P 500 is off about -1.25% with less than an hour to go but off its worst levels of the session and what amount to fresh corrective lows for the market’s broadest proxy. With Wednesday's price action also establishing a loss of about 7% from recent intermediate highs, has the market's fallout become too over-heated? The answer could be "maybe" but we’ll caveat that with "maybe not."

  

Suffice it to say, our prognosis isn’t likely to be of much service to traders. On the other hand, with the CBOE Volatility Index engineering a historically, "overly fearful" test of 30% today and an extreme short-term stretch between its cash and 10-day simple moving average in excess of 40% at session highs, I'd say fast money bulls have some solid evidence to position for a bounce over the next couple of sessions. 

  

One idea, which continues to make sense given the elevated premiums and expectation for limited upside in terms of price and time is a long call condor. Did I repeat myself? Well, not on these pages but just yesterday at Optionetics, the position was discussed in detail and still holds true as a way to participate with less dollar risk on the table in a highly volatile and unstable environment. 

  

  

Shown above is the illustrated 6x March 128/129/130/131 long call condor from the fore-mentioned [Option Watch](http://www.optionetics.com/market/articles/2011/03/15/option-watch-a-less-vixed-bull) article. The sizing reflects reduced portfolio sizing of just less than 1% risk on a model portfolio of $20K due to the ultra-tight timing and increased chance for counter gaps despite oversold market conditions. 

  

As readers can also see, with Wednesday's slightly hotter fallout in the market, this particular long call condor is underwater and truthfully, looking quite suspect. However, given the market's current elevated volatility, the spread is better positioned for a strong magnitude rally. This could otherwise be a less likely event if we were in a more stable trading environment.

  Golden Volatility Adds To Allure Of High-Convex Defensive Hedges

Risk-off option structures on gold that have low premiums and high convexity exposure may be attractive to hedge a full-blown crisis from either geopolitical risks or White House turmoil.


Even amid heightened U.S. political risks, ongoing tension with North Korea and the collision of budget and debt-ceiling deadlines in the autumn, gold's implied volatility is trading at relatively low levels.


The decline in volatility for U.S. real rates is an important factor in this: Investors typically measure the relative attractiveness of holding the metal — a noninterest bearing asset — against those that generate yield. As interest rates increase, the opportunity cost of holding gold rises.


With monetary policy normalization a headwind for gold, the binary nature of North Korea and U.S. political risks may see low-cost, high-convex option structures gain interest. With at-the-money (ATM) options expensive to carry given depressed realized volatility, low-delta out-of-the-money (OTM) call options or one-touch structures may appeal because they incur little cost if implied volatilities move lower on any de-escalation of risk.


The GLD ETF one-month implied/realized volatility ratio at 1.2 highlights the expensive carry of holding ATM options.


Game theory suggests that the probability of a conflict is low, given that a positive diplomatic outcome is best for both sides. Though the risk of North Korea becoming able to launch a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile is making the matter increasingly more urgent for the U.S.


A regime shift in volatility will be best captured with long-convexity exposure combined with tactical shorts, rather than tail-risk strategies betting on mean-reverting volatility spikes.

Online travel giant **Priceline.com**  ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) shares were quiet in front of Tuesday night's earnings release, but its options activity was heavy. Priceline's calls and puts are seeing a strong increase in volume with more than 22,000 contracts changing hands compared to its 50 day average of about 5,000 in activity sufficient to hoist the name atop the unusual volume list for IBD 50 constituents.

  

Monday's trading has been equally split amongst Priceline's calls and puts as evidenced by a very flat put/call ratio of 0.97. The most concentrated activity however is in Priceline's out-of-the-money "AugWk2" 730 and 735 calls. Similar trading of about 800 and 950 contracts with both strikes trumping open interest by three to fourfold is evident of fresh positioning. 

  

Implieds have lifted about 20 points since Friday's close of 71% to about 90% for the at-the-money Weeklys, but a cursory scan of prints showing at least 100-lot spread for $0.60 and rather continuous smaller trades in both calls throughout the session suggests the vertical is a popular strategy. 

  

At about 9.5% out-of-the-money, would-be spread initiators could be either bulls or bears. Bullish optimists might like the bull call spread given peer **Expedia**'s ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) recent upside earnings reaction of about 20%. But do they have any historical support within PCLN itself? Recent performances of -7.40%, 8.61%, 6.97% and last quarter's -5.26% dip would suggest otherwise as they all fall well short of Expedia's post earnings move. 

  

  

On the other hand, traders are pricing in a larger-than-average expected move for PCLN shares, so maybe? Current implieds of 90% in the ATM AugWk2 contract are estimating a 68% or one standard deviation chance prices will remain within roughly 9.5% of 667. That amounts to a possible challenge of the 730 level, but one unlikely to be cleared based on trader expectations. And as this price lines up with the lower of the two strikes, some traders are definitely on edge statistically speaking.

Tech stocks bounced back strongly yesterday with the Nasdaq QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) jumping 0.9%.




As a market exposure play, ProShares Ultra QQQ ([QLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QLD)) joined [SwingTrader](https://get.investors.com/swingtrader/?intcode=start%7Cstart%7Cprdmcst%7C2021%7Cna%7Cst%7Cna%7C%7C397709&src=A011LPH) on the reversal near the [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


The Nasdaq QQQ Trust tracks the Nasdaq 100 and the Ultra QQQ uses leverage to double the effect. That is, whatever the Nasdaq 100 does in a single day, expect QLD to do twice the gain or loss.


Traders that are bullish on tech stocks over the next month could look at a bullish calendar spread on either QQQ, or the more aggressive version, QLD.



Bullish Calendar Spread Option Trade
------------------------------------


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Traders with a price target of 145 on QLD, could place the bullish calendar spread at that price. Placing the trade at 140 would result in a slightly less bullish setup.


Selling the 145 call option expiring May 21 will generate around $120 in premium. Buying the same strike call with an expiration further out to June 18 will cost around $310.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $190 per spread. This is also the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is around $410 but that can vary depending on changes in [implied volatility](https://research.investors.com/options-center/).

Profit Potential And Risk
-------------------------


The idea with the trade is that if QLD stock trades up to around 145, the calendar spread will increase, resulting in a net profit.


A bullish calendar spread is a good way to gain some upside exposure on a stock or ETF without risking too much if the move doesn't play out as expected.


The ideal scenario is a rise up to 145 around May 21 with very little change in implied volatility.


This calendar spread has a [net delta](https://www.investors.com/research/options/options-trading-how-to-start-using-options-how-to-manage-risk/) of 11 meaning the exposure is roughly equivalent to being long 11 shares of QLD.


The recommended stop loss is a close below entry day low (128.22) or first decisive close below 5-day moving average line.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) are two other strong stocks that may be considered for this type of bullish option strategy.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

The stock market sold off sharply Wednesday after Wall Street detected more hawkishness in the minutes from the mid-December Federal Reserve meeting. With the Nasdaq composite below its 50-day moving average, let's take a look at a bearish option trade using Apple stock as an example.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has had a great two months, but put in two bearish candles in a row, and Apple stock is showing negative divergence.


Today, we will look at how to trade a bear call spread for Apple stock.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower or sideways. The stock can even trade slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry.

For Apple stock, a February expiry bear call spread could be set up using the 180 strike as the short call. Use the 185 strike as the long call.


That spread on Wednesday was trading around $1.80 a share.


Apple Stock: Profit Potential
-----------------------------


If executed at that price, the maximum profit on the trade would be $180 per 100-share contract. The maximum risk is $320.


The spread will achieve the maximum profit if Apple stock closes below 180 on February 18. In this case, the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the trader to keep the $180 option premium.



The maximum loss will occur if Apple closes above 185 on February 18. The means the premium seller would lose $320 on the trade.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy. That means you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


Stop/Loss
---------


A stop loss could be set if Apple stock trades above 185, or if the spread value rises from $1.80 to $3.60.


As this is a bearish position, traders that think Apple stock could move higher from here should not enter this trade.

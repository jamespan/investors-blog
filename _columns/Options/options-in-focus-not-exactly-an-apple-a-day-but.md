Early Tuesday, while wearing my other writing cap at Optionetics, I discussed **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) as a possible bearish vertical candidate. The write up titled "Another Tasty Vertical for an Apple Turnover" was based on sufficiently rich option pricing to warrant a hedged position on a stock whose influential technical leadership the past couple years has given way to some less bullish tendencies. 

  

With the broader market still in correction mode following Tuesday's narrow miss in triggering a follow-through day, Apple shares once again turning lower after a test into our previously detailed key resistance zone from 325 to 330, the time could be right for just this sort of position. 

  

The advantage of using a vertical to position directionally is it can cut down the dollar risk ultimately at stake if you're technical prognosis turns out to be just plain wrong when compared to a similar size outright position using a long call or put. 

  

At the same time, even when you're off the mark somewhat, unlike with an outright long call or put, you can profit. The vertical trader can even find themselves realizing their maximum potential return. That is if the stock or index in question doesn't move inside the spread. Plus, while we recommend using stop losses, it's nice to know your worst-case scenario is only possible at expiration and if the entire spread is in the money.

  

As part of the fore-mentioned piece, we illustrated the July 325 / 330 bear call spread for a price of about $1.65 but anticipating a larger credit if some technical confirmation of resistance were to be confirmed in the days ahead. Less than two sessions later and shares about 8 points higher near 322.75 but once again leading the market lower and after failing a test of zone resistance; limited risk nibbling of some apple turnover for $2.15 looks all the more tempting.

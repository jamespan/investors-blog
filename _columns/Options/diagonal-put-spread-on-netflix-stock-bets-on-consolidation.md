**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) pulled back sharply following [last week's earnings announcement](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/netflix-stock-falls-on-disappointing-sales-growth/). But it's still holding above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). Traders that think Netflix stock will consolidate around this level could look at a diagonal put spread.




Diagonal Put Spread On Netflix Stock
------------------------------------


The diagonal put spread is an option strategy that uses different strike prices and different expiration dates on the option chain. These are found diagonal from each other on an option chain, hence the name. We'll sell a put at the near-term expiration with a higher strike on Netflix stock while simultaneously buying a put at an expiration date further out at a lower strike.


This is an advanced strategy because the different expirations will impact the option prices differently.


Here's how to flesh it out for Netflix stock:


Selling an Aug. 18 put with a strike of 400 brings in a credit of $4.15. Buying a Sept. 15 put with a 380 strike costs $4.60.


The net cost on this Netflix stock option spread works out to $45.


Profits And Losses
------------------


The $45 cost is also the max loss for the trade on the upside.


But the downside risk is larger. If Netflix stock falls, that's where you could be looking at the maximum loss of $2,045. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread of the strikes (20) multiplied by 100 and adding in the cost of the trade (45).


The maximum potential gain is around $600, which occurs if Netflix stock closes right at 400 on Aug. 18. In that case, you get to keep the entire short put credit of $430 plus your long put will still have value with another month until expiration.


The trade has a nice profit zone in between 390 and 450. So a consolidation of gains for Netflix stock at its current level works for the trade.


Please remember that options are risky. Investors can lose 100% of their investment.

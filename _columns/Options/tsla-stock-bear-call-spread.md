The market sits in a confirmed uptrend, but some leaders remain weak. Traders with a lot of bullish exposure may want to start hedging their bets by adding some bearish option trades, such as the following example with TSLA stock.




**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock is one that could be a good candidate given the stock has been unable to break back above the declining [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


A bearish trade can also serve as a nice hedge for [this long-term bullish idea](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tsla-stock-cash-secured-put-generates-income/).


TSLA stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 89, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 74 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96. I'm looking to add some short-term bearish exposure with a stop loss if TSLA stock closes back above the 21-day moving average.


An easy trade for beginners is a bear call spread.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiration.


TSLA Stock Bear Call Spread
---------------------------


On TSLA stock, an April bear call spread could be set up using the 750 strike as the short call and the 755 strike as the long call.



I would look to sell that spread for $1.80 or higher depending on where the market trades today. Trading is likely to be volatile today with the Fed meeting.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $180 per contract with a maximum risk of $320.


The spread would achieve the maximum 56.25% profit if TSLA stock closes below 750 on April 16. In that case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the trader to keep the $180 option premium.


The maximum loss of $320 would occur if TSLA stock closes above 755 on April 16.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy. You always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


TSLA earnings are scheduled for April 28, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.


Tesla stock is forming a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/). But it has a long ways to go before finishing a bullish pattern that could set up a [potential breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/) and a run to new highs.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Nvidia stock is showing up on my screen for having a low implied volatility percentage.




That means options are cheap relative to the last 12 months, and today I'm going to look at a reverse butterfly trade.


A reverse butterfly is a bit like a long straddle, but we can reduce the cost by selling the outer wings. This keeps the cost of the trade lower, but also puts a limit on the potential gains.


**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) has an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 85, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 97 and a Relative Strength Rating of 59.



Long straddles on NVDA stock are very expensive, because the option prices are so high.


Nvidia Stock: The Reverse Butterfly Trade Idea
----------------------------------------------


Another idea is to trade a reverse butterfly, which you could construct as follows:


* Sell 1 in-the-money call
* Buy 2 at-the-money calls
* Sell 1 out-of-the-money call


The trade will benefit from a big move in either direction from Nvidia stock.


Let's take a look at how that might look on NVDA stock.


* Sell 1 June 18-expiring 480 call at 61.25
* Buy 2 June 18 520 calls at 39.85
* Sell 1 June 18 560 call at 31.35


In total, the trade would generate around $1,290 in premium (that's also the maximum possible gain) with a maximum risk of $2,710.



What the trade is looking for is a quick price move in either direction. The trade loses value each day through time decay while NVDA stock remains between the break-even points of 492.90 and 547.10.


These are calculated by taking the lower strike (480) and adding the premium (12.90) and taking the upper strike (560) and subtracting the premium.


For a trade like this I would set a stop loss of 20% which is around $540.


A reverse butterfly is a nonstandard option trade and therefore not recommended for beginners.


Always remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

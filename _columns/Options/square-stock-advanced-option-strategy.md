**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) operates in the point-of-sale market and is highly rated at IBD with a Composite Rating of 97 of 99, and a Relative Strength Rating of 96. Square stock is also ranked No. 1 in its industry group.




On Wednesday, call volume outpaced put volume by 2-to-1, which could provide a bullish impetus in the lead-up to earnings on Aug. 5.


One trade I was looking at Wednesday was a diagonal call spread, which is an advanced option strategy that involves selling a near-dated call and buying a longer-dated call.


Selling the Aug. 7-expiring call with a 150 strike price and buying the Aug. 21 160-strike call would cost around 26 cents, or $26 per contract.


That is the maximum risk on the downside. The maximum risk on the upside is equal to the difference between the strikes plus the premium paid.


With the strikes being $10 apart that makes the risk on the upside $1,026.


Profit Zone For Diagonal Call Spread
------------------------------------


The profit zone occurs between around 130 and 157, but the catch is you don't want the stock to get to that level too quickly.

I would set a stop loss of around 25% of capital at risk, so around $250, or if Square stock rallied above the short call at 150.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

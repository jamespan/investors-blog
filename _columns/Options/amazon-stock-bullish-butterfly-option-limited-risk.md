The market still looks weak but potentially overdone temporarily. Magnificent 7 stocks tried to make a stand on Tuesday so traders looking to take some bullish exposure may want to think about doing so in a limited way. Here's a bullish butterfly spread on Amazon stock that could fit the bill.


Amazon Stock: Venturing To The Bullish Side
-------------------------------------------


**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) came down below its 200-day line but is trying to make a run back above it. An important level to keep an eye on is 200.


Traders can gain some upside exposure in a low-risk way via a bullish butterfly.


A butterfly option spread involves three different option strikes. Each option uses the same expiration date and the spread can use either calls or puts.


By trading a butterfly with a bullish bias, we can place the trade cheaply and have a large potential payoff if the stock hits our target.


Say we have a price target of 210 for Amazon within the next few weeks. Let's look at how we can set up a bullish butterfly based on that assumption


* Buy 1 April 17 Amazon 200 call @ 8.10
* Sell 2 April 17 Amazon 210 calls @ 4.15
* Buy 1 April 17 Amazon 220 call @ 1.85


This trade only costs around $165 per spread but has a payoff potential much higher than that.


How To Profit
-------------


The ideal scenario is for Amazon to be right around 210 at the April 17 expiration.


The maximum loss on the trade is equal to the premium paid of around $165 per contract. This occurs anywhere below 200 or above 220.


The maximum potential profit on the trade is $835. This is calculated by taking the width of the butterfly (10) times 100 less the premium paid (165).


Taking a low-risk trade like this can be one way to participate in any further rally without risking too much capital.


Earnings Risk And Ratings
-------------------------


Amazon is due to report earnings in late April, so this trade shouldn't have earnings risk if held to expiration.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Amazon is ranked No. 11 in its group. Further, it has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 80, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 79 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 65.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

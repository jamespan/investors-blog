Options trading strategies can be complex and multi-legged, but they can be simple enough for options trading beginners to enhance account performance.




The difference between the two options trading strategies is limited only to the imagination and education of the investor. In the simplest terms, options trading gives someone the ability to control a stock in lieu of ownership. This control gives someone the right to either buy or sell a set stock at a set price for a given period of time.


The two types of options are calls and puts. Calls allow an investor the right to buy a stock at a set price on or before a set date. Puts allow an investor the right to sell a set stock at a set price on or before a set date.


By understanding these simple definitions, traders can learn options trading strategies for both bullish and bearish markets.


In their simplest terms, call options are often used to replace stocks in a bull market, but why would you buy a put option? Some basic options strategies for investors exist with simply buying a put option, and are valid in either bull or bear markets. But the most fundamental is using a put to ensure a long stock position.


Options Trading: Put Options As Insurance
-----------------------------------------


One of the best options strategies for beginners is the use of put options as insurance.


Options started as insurance policies for either long or short stock. A put option gives the buyer the right to sell a set stock at a set price on or before a set date. This means that no matter how low a stock goes, the investor has the right to sell the stock for the agreed upon price.


Why would an investor purchase insurance on the stock instead of using the stop-loss? The answer to that question will be specific to each investor, but things like tax considerations when selling, dividend payments, or belief in the company through a rough patch are all very valid reasons that an investor might buy insurance on the stock. Look at the example below:


Caterpillar Stock
-----------------


There could be many reasons an investor would want to keep their **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) stock. Maybe the stock was purchased a few months ago and they want to see it go to long-term capital gains. Selling for a loss now would hurt that strategy.



Another reason may be that the stock was purchased many years ago. The holder might be willing to purchase insurance at a level to "lock in" profits for a small cost. In both cases, continual ownership of the stock would provide them with dividends of about $3.44 per share (at the time of this writing). This could offset the cost of purchasing insurance.


Take the following scenario as an example in CAT. The stock cleared a flat base in late April 2017 at around 100. It was an easy stock to hold, and the gain hit 30% in October. One way to lock in $30 of profit and sit through a pullback would've been to buy the Jan 2019 130 put option that recently came with a premium of around $5.25. This would give the investor the right to sell CAT at 130 a share. No matter how far the stock fell, the contract holder could sell the stock for a nice gain on their investment.

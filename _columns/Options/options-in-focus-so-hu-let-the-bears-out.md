Despite the broader market now back in "uptrend" mode per The Big Picture, shares of highly ranked **Sohu.com**  ([SOHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOHU)) are likely disappointing more than a few stock and likely option traders in Wednesday's second half. Whether a bull wishes to call Tuesday's breakout and today's early follow-through attempt a square box, a double-bottom base or maybe even a cup-shaped formation; doesn't really matter when the stock is a bit more than 3.5 points and nearly 4% below the buy point. 

  

There's still room of course to be patient if you're into giving a stock like SOHU the ordained 7% to 8%, in a healthy market environment, of course. On the other hand, If you're a bit more about other options, like me, and maybe helped along today's well out-of-the money June 110 call into the most active position on volume of more than 2,000 contracts and negligible open interest suggesting largely the opening of long call positions; well, limited risk is also feeling the heat as well. 

  

The June 110 call is currently priced around $1.40, at session lows and a full $0.60 to $0.75 removed from trading range highs of $2.00 to $2.15 scored during the more optimistic opening minutes as shares traded around the proper buy point and to fresh marginal highs on roughly 400 to 450 contracts and multiple smaller prints. 

  

Personally, I wasn't involved and truthfully the soft delta of about 17 to 18 is a bit too weak for an outright directional play. In my opinion I like to stick with 30 to 50 deltas for that type purchase. One characteristic I do agree with is the June contract maintains just less than 80 calendar days to expiration and implieds in the mid 40s are quite reasonable relative to longer-term statistical movements in SOHU shares. Both those conditions mean time decay and implied volatility aren't big risks at this time. 

  

The delta in this case is also benefitting those traders, believe it or not, more than if the call purchased had had a larger delta such as the 30 to 50 favored by me. Unfortunately, even the best laid plans which allow for a good deal of wiggle room and time to cooperate can and will sometimes go bad in a heartbeat. 

  

True, the clock is still ticking in more than one way for SOHU, but if I were in those bulls' shoes holding the long call, I'd rather pull the plug with a managed 50% stop loss than risk seeing a D.O.A. and a position casualty of 100% of the premium paid. "SO-HU" let the bears out anyways? Bottom-line, to survive in a mad money market it doesn't really matter.

**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) stock reports earnings this week on Tuesday after the close.




SQ is currently above the 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages and showing nice accumulation. With a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 88 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92, SQ stock is highly rated.


Traders that expect a positive earnings result could look at a bull put spread expiring later this week.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration. To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Traders who think SQ stock will rally or at least not drop by too much could look to sell a Feb. 26 260 put and buy a Feb. 26 255 put.


**Bullish SQ Stock Option Trade**
---------------------------------


As of Friday, this spread was trading for around $1.30. This means a trader selling this spread would receive $130 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $370.


That represents a potential 35.14% return on risk in five days as long as SQ stock remains above 260. If SQ stock closes below 255 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $370.



With this being such a short-term trade, there is no chance to adjust the trade if it goes bad. Trading options over earnings can be risky, so keeping position size small is a good idea.


The FactSet consensus calls for Square's earnings in the fourth quarter gaining 4% vs. a year earlier to 24 cents per share on revenue of $3.10 billion, up nearly 136%.


The options market is pricing in a 9.20% move in the stock in either direction. Implied volatility is elevated at 62.4%, which puts it in the 58th percentile of all readings in the last 12 months.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

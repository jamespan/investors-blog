**Nuance Communications** ([NUAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUAN)) was atop the unusual option volume database for IBD 50 constituents in Monday's session. While there have been no fresh catalysts of notice, shares were off an outsized 1.7% in late trade and appeared to be confirming a bear flag set against its 50-day simple moving average which has developed since reporting its mixed earnings back on Feb 9. 

  

Interestingly enough and on the option side, calls are outflanking put activity by a massive 7-to-1 margin on large overall volume of 15,000. Most active and accounting for roughly 40% of today's trading, more than 6,500 March 28 calls have crossed the tape on session long activity priced between $0.50 and $0.65 per contract.

  

With existing open interest of 4,550, it's easy to suspect some closing down of positions on today's weakness in shares. That is, except for the fact volume in the other surrounding money strikes is so much lighter by comparison despite maintaining equally large open interest statistics. As much, it would be hard to except the premise bulls in the March 28 call are the only interested long call traders as a lot, exiting in force today. Thus, we'd estimate there's a good deal of positions being opened today.

  

What's more interesting, with implieds jumping by about 20% from near 42% to 55% and premiums at their highest levels since earnings, we suspect buyers are actually behind the bulk of this highly concentrated activity despite the less sure-footed technical position and mixed report. 

  

In order for the highly theta sensitive contract to double in price from its current $0.55, shares of NUAN will need to rally by a rough and rather large 10% to about the $29 level. The gains of $0.55 would be mostly the byproduct of delta / gamma and result of intrinsic value rather than today's 100% extrinsic premium. That said and for better or likely worse, we strongly suspect the heat-seeking activity is tied to some sort of bullish, short-term newsletter call trying to make a limited risk play on this week's iPad3 unveiling by **Apple**  ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is due to [report earnings on Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) after the closing bell. The options market is pricing in a 5.2% move in either direction. Let's consider a bull put spread trade in Microsoft stock.




Microsoft stock has stayed above the lower expected range following all six of their last earnings announcements.


Let's analyze how we can structure an option trade that fits these views: 1) we think Microsoft stock will stay within the expected range; and 2) the response to the earnings report is likely to be positive.


Taking the at-the-money put and call for the Aug. 2 expiration, we can see that the expected range is 5.2%.


Now that we know the expected range, let's find a bull put spread that has the short strike roughly 5.2% below the stock price.


**Microsoft Stock Today: The Trade**
------------------------------------


Selling the Aug. 2-expiration 400-strike put option and buying the 395 put would create a bull put spread. This spread was recently trading for around $0.80 per set of put contracts. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $80 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $420.


That represents a 19% return on risk between now and Aug. 2 if MSFT remains above 400. If Microsoft stock closes below 395 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $420.



The break-even point for the bull put spread stands at 399.20. Calculate it by taking 400 less the 0.80 option premium per contract. There is little room for adjustment with short-term trades such as this held over earnings.


All said, a 19% return in a few days would be nice in Microsoft stock. But the possibility of losing 100% is also very real. As such, this style of trade is only for traders with a high-risk tolerance.

  Options In Focus: Better Than a Butterfly?

What do you get when you sell an at-the-money straddle and buy an out-of-the money strangle? The answer is you'll receive a credit for your effort. The other result, which also happens to be the more important outcome with regards to risk is you've put together a synthetic long butterfly also known as an iron butterfly. 

  

As a regular butterfly's maximum risk is defined by the premium paid, an iron butterfly using the same strikes in the same contract month but put together by purchasing an out-of-the money call and put and selling an equivalent amount of at-the-money straddles, maintains the same risk. However, because a credit is generated the risk is figured out by subtracting that credit from the distance between the strikes. 

  

Why is this so? Another way to view the iron butterfly is as two at-the-money verticals, a bear call spread and a bull put spread which share the middle sold strike. Only in a perfect world where the underlying finds itself exactly at the middle strike at expiration will both spreads be worthless and the trader left to enjoy the credit as a profit received in full. 

  

At all other price levels that a stock might get pulled to and from, only one of the two verticals, which the trader has sold, will have intrinsic value. Come expiration and if shares are above one of the purchased options (either call or put), the one spread will be intrinsically worth its maximum amount or the difference between the strikes. That's much to the detriment of the trader's iron butterfly as they'll be losing that amount and only able to offset the loss by the lesser initial premium taken in. 

  

  

Losses are never fun, but much like the regular fly, the amount at risk with the iron butterfly is typically a small dollar amount per spread. In conjunction with using some other kind of risk management like 2% to 4% of their portfolio, it's a bit hard to feel too badly for this trader. Well unless they thought they had on something extra special because it was for a credit. 

  

Shown above and to illustrate a very cheap, dollar wise, iron butterfly is a 20x RIMM September 29/30/31 priced for a credit of $0.90 with risk of $0.10. So close to expiration this butterfly is deceivingly attractive because the company reports Thursday after the close. As much, the likelihood of shares remaining inside the wings, let alone near $30, is a long shot due to the strong potential re-pricing of shares for better or worse.

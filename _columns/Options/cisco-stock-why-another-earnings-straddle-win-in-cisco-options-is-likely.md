Last week, we looked at a [short straddle on Walt Disney stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/disney-stock-how-to-trade-options-in-disney-why-a-straddle-looks-enticing-during-earnings/) traded over the earnings announcement.




With **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) [having reported earnings after the bell Wednesday](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-earnings-csco-stock-q12020/), I thought it would be a good chance to have a look at another example.


As a reminder, to set up a short straddle a trader would sell an at-the-money call and an at-the-money put.


This is a risky trade because it involves the sale of naked options, so it is not recommended for beginners.


The losses are potentially unlimited so always keep that in mind.


After an earnings announcement, implied volatility takes a massive drop, so the short straddle trader is hoping the stock will not make a big move. A profit generates from the erosion of the option premium that was sold.


Looking At Cisco Stock
----------------------



Toward the end of Wednesday's trade, the stock was trading around 42, so an earnings short straddle would involve selling the May 15-expiring call option and May 15-expiring put option at 42. Cisco closed the session at 41.95.


That straddle was selling for around $2.60 on Wednesday afternoon. If we take the straddle price divided by the stock price it gives us the expected move that market makers have estimated for the stock over the next few days. In this case the market was expecting a move of around 6.2% in either direction.


Any trader that sold that straddle would achieve a profit if Cisco stock stays between 39.40 and 44.60 for the next few days.


In the first 90 minutes of Thursday's trading, CSCO traded near 44, so there's a fairly good chance that the straddle sellers will win again on this one.


Implied volatility on those 42 calls and puts was sitting at a huge 96% Wednesday afternoon.


That's a massive level of volatility considering the stock itself had a general level of implied volatility around 42%.


Take a look at those 42 calls and puts after the open Thursday. You will see the implied volatility (and therefore the option prices) take a massive drop.


After A Short Straddle Trade In Cisco Stock
-------------------------------------------


Earnings season is starting to slow down now with only a few big-name companies left to report.



So far **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) straddle sellers have done well and it looks as if that might be the case with CSCO as well.


**Walmart** ([WMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WMT)) and **Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) report on May 19. **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) will release fiscal Q1 numbers on May 20. After that we have **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) on May 21 and **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) on May 22.

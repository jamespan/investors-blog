After **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) got back above its [200-day moving average,](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) it's traded tightly just above that line. By using a broken-wing butterfly option strategy, we'll get the most profit if GOOGL stock stays in a trading range. But we have no risk on an upside move and a move to the downside has limited risk.




Broken-Wing Butterfly Option Trade
----------------------------------


With a regular butterfly option trade, the wings are placed an equal distance from the short strike. With this broken-wing butterfly on GOOGL stock, we leave a larger gap on a particular side.


This results in less risk on one side and more risk on the opposite side.


To set up the trade using GOOGL stock, we can do the following:


* Buy 1 June 16 put with a 100 strike price @ 2.47 per share
* Sell 2 June 16 puts with a 105 strike @ 4.36
* Buy 1 June 16 put at 108 strike @ 6.00


Notice that the put option with the upper strike price is three points away from the middle puts while the lower strike price is five points away from the middle puts. That uneven difference is what makes it a broken-wing butterfly. The risk will be minimal on the upside but larger on the downside.

Risk Vs. Reward In GOOGL Stock
------------------------------


This broken-wing butterfly trade on GOOGL stock brings in a slight credit, which means there is no risk on the upside.


If GOOGL stock finished above 108 at expiration,  all the puts expire worthless and the credit is yours to keep.


The maximum gain is $325 if the stock finishes at the short strike of 105 at expiration. It's multiplying 100 by the difference in the short strike and the higher strike plus the premium received for the entire trade (3 +0.25 = 3.25). If this were a debit, you would subtract the premium from the difference in strikes.


On the downside, the maximum loss is limited to $175 if GOOGL stock finishes below 100 at expiration. This is a risk-defined trade and you always know the worst-case scenario ahead of time. You calculate the maximum loss in this case by taking the difference between the short strike and the lowest strike and subtracting the maximum profit (5 — 3.25 = 1.75).


The ideal scenario for the trade is that GOOGL stock stays between 102 and 108 for the next month or so.


The trade starts with delta of 4, so has a slight bullish bias to start, but that will flip to negative delta closer to expiry if the stock is above 105.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss if GOOGL stock broke below 102 and a set a profit target of 10%-15%.


Trade Update
------------


As a trade update, this **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) [put ratio spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/boeing-stock-today-why-the-put-ratio-spread-can-gain-as-much-as-1100-by-may/) is up nearly $200 per contract and can be closed.

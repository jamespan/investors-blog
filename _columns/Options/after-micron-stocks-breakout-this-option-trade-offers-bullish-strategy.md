**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) broke out to a new high this week and was Tuesday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/mu-stock-pops-as-pc-industry-pricing-worries-fade/). 




Micron stock jumped 10% on Tuesday, clearing an 89.15 [entry point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) out of a long [cup-with-handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/) pattern. The company is ranked No. 4 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 90 and a Relative [Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 87. 


With the market uptrend under pressure, investors may prefer to use options rather than outright stock purchases. 


One mildly bullish option strategy to consider is a bull put spread. To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. 


Selling the February-expiring, 85 strike price put and buying the 80 put would create a bull put spread. This spread was trading Wednesday for around $1.40. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $140 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $360. 


Micron Stock Trade Risk, Potential Profit
-----------------------------------------


That represents a 39% return on risk between now and Feb. 18 if Micron stock remains above 85. If Micron stock closes below 80 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $360. 



The break-even point for the bull put spread is 83.60, which is calculated as 85 less the 1.40 option premium per contract. 


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 12, which means it is a similar exposure to owning 12 shares of MU stock. This exposure, though, will change over time as the stock price moves. 


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1.40 to $2.80, I would consider closing early for a loss. With earnings not due until late March, this trade should have no earnings risk. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

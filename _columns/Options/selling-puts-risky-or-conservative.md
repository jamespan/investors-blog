"Selling puts" is a strategy that is the subject of much controversy. It strikes fear in the hearts of some investors and draws yawns from others.  Why is there such a range of reactions? This article discusses the potential uses and risks of selling put options and then concludes with an example using a current stock on [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx).

  

**Strategy Mechanics**

  

The seller of a put option is described as having a "short put position," and the seller of an equity put assumes the obligation of purchasing 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. In return for assuming this obligation, the put seller receives the premium that is paid by the purchaser. 

  

An example of a short put is: "sell 1 XYZ July 50 Put at 6.50." The initiator of this transaction assumes the obligation of purchasing 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 per share if an assignment notice is received. In return, the premium of $6.50 per share, or $650 in this example, not including commissions, is received.

  

**Risk and Profit Potential**

  

If the price of XYZ stock closes at or above $50 on the third Friday in July, then the 50 Put will expire worthless and the premium received will be kept as income. If XYZ closes below $50 at expiration, then the put will have value. As a result, the put owner will likely exercise the right to sell XYZ stock at the strike price of $50. The put seller will then be obligated to purchase 100 shares of XYZ stock.

  

**An Investment-Oriented Use of a Short Put**

  

Consider Geoff, a conservative investor, who finds XYZ stock to be an attractive investment, not at its current price of $50, but at $43.50. Assume also, that XYZ July 50 Puts are trading for 6.50 and that Geoff is not in any hurry to acquire XYZ stock.

  

If Geoff is forecasting that XYZ will trade in a range between $40 and $50 between now and July option expiration, then two of Geoff’s alternatives are the following. First, he might place a limit price order to buy 100 shares of XYZ at $43.50. This is known as a "Good-till-Cancelled" (GTC) order. Second, he might sell 1 July 50 Put at 6.50.  In both cases it is assumed that Geoff deposits $43.50 per share in cash in his brokerage account to pay for the stock. Let’s compare the two strategies. Remember that commissions and taxes are not included in the comparison.

  

While the GTC order to buy stock at $43.50 is being represented, Geoff is obligated to buy 100 shares at $43.50. At expiration, the price of XYZ stock will either have stayed above $43.50, and Geoff will not have purchased any stock, or it will have traded below $43.50 and he can expect to have bought 100 shares at $43.50.  If the stock stays above $43.50, then Geoff, in the case of the GTC order, will have earned nothing except interest on funds in a money market account.

  

If, however, Geoff sells a July 50 Put at 6.50 per share, the premium is received. At expiration, if XYZ is above $50, no stock will be purchased. Geoff, however, gets to keep the premium. If XYZ is below $50 at expiration, Geoff is obligated to buy 100 shares at $50. Since he received 6.50 per share when he sold the put, his net cost is $43.50 per share, not including commissions. Assignment prior to expiration is also a possibility that Geoff should consider. Either way, however, the put premium is retained.

  

**Discussion of Risk**

  

Geoff, the investor in the example above, is typically described as having sold a "cash-secured put." This means that sufficient cash to purchase the stock has been placed on deposit with the brokerage firm. If the put is assigned, then paying for the stock is a simple matter, just use the funds on deposit. The maximum theoretical risk of a stock price decline is the same as for any other stock holding purchased for cash. The maximum risk is equal to the amount invested, and Geoff should monitor the XYZ shares as he would any other stock holding. The maximum percentage risk is 100% of the cash invested in the stock.

  

**Current Example from [Leaderboard](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/leaders/default.aspx)**

  

**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) remains extended from a rebound off its 10-week line. With shares extended, a key level to watch is its 10-week moving average around 173. The stock has found support at the line repeatedly for many months. 

  

At 180.66 at the close of trading on Monday, June 3, the stock is $7.00 or above this potential entry point. If you are torn between buying now and hoping for rally now and waiting for an entry near $173, the options market gives you an opportunity to wait for the lower price and earn some income on your cash at the same time.

  

With Visa trading at 180.66 at the close on June 3, the V July 175 Put had a bid price of 3.50 per share. Selling this put allows an investor to commit to buying V stock at an effective price of 171.50 (175.00 — 3.50) and to earn approximately 2% income for the 48 days that the cash is on deposit to buy the shares.

  

If the price of V is below 175 at July expiration, then shares of stock will be purchased. If the stock price is higher than 175, then the option premium will be kept as income.

  

**Summary**

  

Selling an equity put creates an obligation to purchase the underlying stock. The profit potential is limited to the premium received, but the risk is substantial. Below the break-even point (strike price minus premium received) the maximum dollar risk of a short put position is equal to a long stock position.

  

The term "cash-secured put" is used to describe a short put position that is backed with sufficient cash on deposit to purchase the underlying stock. Selling cash-secured puts can be viewed as a conservative, investment oriented strategy when the goal is to purchase the underlying stock and when there is no hurry to purchase it. "Selling puts" can be "risky "or "conservative." It depends on how you do it.

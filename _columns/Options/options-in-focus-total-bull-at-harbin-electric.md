Erstwhile growth stock **Harbin Electric**  ([HRBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRBN)) was trying to restore some of its former glory Friday and bucking the broader market's meet-and-greet with still lower weekly prices. The bid in shares occurred on the heels of a report stating the company's chairman and chief executive officer, in cahoots with Abax Global Capital, still intended to take the outfit private at $24.00 a share.

  

Intraday, HRBN saw some bulls react to the news by quickly driving the stock higher to $17 and up more than 10% before succumbing to some volatile profit-taking and slightly less chipper gains of 5.5% near 16.35. For their part, option traders continue to be more disbelieving of the report by a couple of measures.

  

Puts have been favored over calls by a margin of two-to-one on heavy overall volume of 25,000 contracts. For Harbin Electric, the larger put activity is actually pretty much par for the course as today's action matches its 200SMA put/call ratio. That interest is also mostly unsurprising given shares maintain short interest of nearly 37% and a short cover ratio of 10.5 days. 

  

In general, when there's heavy short interest and shares are hard-to-borrow or "H-T-B", puts have a tendency to be more active as traders wishing to go short need to use options rather than stock. Similarly, bulls wishing to hedge realize a put is the best means to do so in such an environment. 

  

What might be a better clue as to option traders refusing to believe the news of a pending buyout at $24 is the very real lack of speculative buying in at or out-of-the money calls despite the gratis, substantial implied volatility skew in the puts due to the existing H-T-B factor. 

  

In the end, with HRBN's much cheaper out-of-the money calls in strikes like the 17.50s and 20s still not finding any real muscular, speculative love despite the substantial premium of $24 to current levels. You have to believe the non-believers, who have been right for quite some time now, are still onto something that has little to do with higher prices.

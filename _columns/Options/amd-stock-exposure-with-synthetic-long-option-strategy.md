One method of using options is to trade a synthetic long stock position to gain bullish exposure to a stock without having to allocate as much capital. Here's an example of a synthetic long position using AMD stock.




Synthetic Long Stock Position
-----------------------------


A synthetic long stock position involves selling an at-the-money put and buying an at-the-money call. With leading stocks like **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)), this achieves nearly the same profits or losses as owning the stock outright but with less capital required.


So, trading a synthetic long stock position is similar to trading with leverage. That makes it riskier than a regular investment. Potential gains are magnified relative to your capital outlay, but so too are the potential losses.


Here are the details for a synthetic long stock position in AMD stock.

AMD Stock Setup
---------------


In mid-June, AMD stock was hovering around the 55 level. The synthetic long position looks at the calls and puts that are at-the-money.



At that time, an October 55 put was trading around $6.50 and an October 55 call was trading around $6.40.


A trader selling the put and buying the call would receive $0.10 per contract in premium or $10.


However, don't be fooled into thinking this is the maximum that the trade can lose. If the stock goes against you, the short put and long call will both lose value. The combination will resemble what you would lose in the stock.


This trade is effectively the same as owning 100 shares of AMD stock, which would have been an exposure of around $5,500. So traders need to position size accordingly.


The margin required for a trade like this would vary from broker to broker but was around $1,740 by my calculations. That's significantly less than the $5,500 required to purchase 100 shares of AMD stock.


Option Leverage Provides 127% Return
------------------------------------


Fast-forward to today and AMD stock is trading around 76.


The October 55 put is trading for 0.24 and the October 55 call for around 22.20.


This results in a net gain of $2,210 for the synthetic long trade.


Considering the margin requirement of $1,740, that equates to a return of 127%.


Now you know how to use options to trade a synthetic long stock position.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

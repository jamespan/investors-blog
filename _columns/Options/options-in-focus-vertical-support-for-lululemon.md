With just under 90 minutes left in the session, No. 1 ranked IBD 50 component and yoga-centric apparel and accessory outfit **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is shaping up nicely to confirm a pullback that's finding support off prior base highs and 50-day simple moving average support. 

  

For the time being we'll coin the move an optimistic "Downward Bull Stretch" as the price action appears constructive enough given the state of the market's own "under pressure" status per Investor's Business Daily. It appears option traders agree too. 

  

In Thursday's session volume is running slightly below normal but healthy-looking with more than 3,000 calls changing hands while out-pacing put activity by a 1.75-to-1.00 margin. Premiums are mostly pricey but not through-the-nose exorbitant by both recent statistical and implied measures. 

  

At the same time, the liquidity provision, which isn't exactly on par with the likes of an **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) or **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) means multi-leg strategies beyond the two-legged kind, are largely beyond reach, well, without reaching too far as to hurt oneself, if you get my drift. 

  

Given the circumstances in LULU's options and the market's own somewhat tricky pose, like-minded traders that see a support entry as attractive might wish to consider the use of a bull vertical. I like the idea of using the March contract and the surrounding money calls i.e. 75 and 80 strikes for about $2 per spread or selling the March 75 / 70 put spread for $1.50 mid market. 

  

With the latter, there's less lifting or sweat required as shares can actually sit and the trader could, at expiration, walk away with the full credit. And with the former bull call spread, a bit more strength and stamina will be needed by shares of LULU in order to maximize its potential. However, at $3 of possible profit, that's double what could be made with the put vertical. Which is better? That's kind of like asking someone which do they prefer, "Bikram or Ashtanga?"

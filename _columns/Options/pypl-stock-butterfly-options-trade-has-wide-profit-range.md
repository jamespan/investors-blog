**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) stock has had a terrific [rally since bouncing off the 50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/research/options/pypl-stock-bull-call-spread-offers-limited-risk-upside/) in late January.




The rally is slowing down here, and the stock is starting to look a little overbought.


PYPL stock is now 19% above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and a massive 46% above the 200-day moving average.


While it would take a brave person to bet against PYPL stock, today I want to look at an option trade idea that will profit if PYPL stock rallies up to around 300, but not much further.



The trade is called a broken wing butterfly.


A broken wing butterfly using calls is a trade that can be set up with little risk on the downside and a nice profit zone on the upside.


The catch is that there is risk on the upside if PYPL makes a big move higher. So, this is a neutral to slightly bullish trade.


Very bullish traders would not enter this trade.


Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on PYPL stock.


Buy 1 February 26 320 call at $1.40.


Sell 2 February 26 300 call at $3.95.


Buy 1 February 26 290 call at $6.80.


Notice that the lower strike call is 10 points away from the middle call and the upper call is 20 points away.


PYPL Stock Butterfly Options Trade Is Slightly Bullish
------------------------------------------------------


This broken wing butterfly trade will cost $30 to enter and that is the maximum potential loss on the downside. The worst that can happen is all the calls expire worthless and the trader loses the $30 premium.


On the upside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the width between the first two strikes (10) multiplied by 100 and adding the premium paid (30).


That gives us 10 x 100 + 30 = $1,030


The maximum gain can be calculated as 10 x 100 − 30 = $970 although this would only ever be achieved if PYPL expired right at 300.


The ideal scenario for the trade is that PYPL stays below 300 until expiration.


The risk on the trade is that PYPL stock shoots significantly higher, particularly early in the trade. For that reason, bullish traders would prefer to look at a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/twlo-stock-bull-put-spread/) or a straight long call.


For those with a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, a broken wing butterfly could be a nice way to trade PYPL stock.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 20% or around $200.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

It appears the playbook of the market once more going into correction mode can be dusted off after Thursday's precipitous bearish follow-through to the prior session's final hour implosion. Yet, it's also equally if not more likely the next percentage move in the market is going to be in the form of bargain hunting. 

  

In truth, a pervasive congestion pattern that's developed over the past several weeks in the likes of the S&P 500 certainly looks like it could be a bear flag that's signaled. On the other hand, there is a potential double bottom, which bulls might dare consider. Unfortunately, the technical distinction between one and the other can be hard to determine without some good use of hindsight analysis or failing to use other tools which might guide us towards being on the right side of those fuzzy patterns. 

  

Our tool of choice is most often the market's most notorious sentiment index known as the VIX. Thursday's historically overly fearful sentiment with prices climbing up to nearly 44% intraday suggests siding with optimists seeing a bargain-hunting opportunity in the near-term and maybe a longer-term corrective bottom. 

  

Furthering this less popular view of the market, the VIX has produced a short-term stretch of more than 15% above its 10-day simple moving average. This action makes the gauge prone to some mean, but less mean (if you know what I mean), mean reversion as the VIX has a strong tendency to normalize after extreme relative behavior. While absolute price levels such as 30% as the say all, end all "fear" level can be tricky, the use of relative price action based on the short-term moving average is a way to better quantify and qualify historical prices as being relevant. 

  

Finally, the current set up in the VIX has failed to take out the recent range highs. At this stage we view as a good or bullish situation. To us, and speaking qualitatively, it has that sort of tired, throwing in the towel sort of feel to it. In the end, judging sentiment for clues is both a mix of math and the abstractâ€”to which in this situation, we're giving bargain-hunting bulls the benefit of the doubt they'll come out in play despite those sometimes scary weekend holding periods which traders need to reckon with.

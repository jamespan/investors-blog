What is a covered call? And could this option trade work well in a health-care REIT such as **Medical Properties Trust** ([MPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPW))?




The stock offers a high yield and was recently featured in IBD's [Income Investor column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/the-income-investor/). Plus, MPW stock is in a slow yet steady uptrend, showing a series of higher highs and higher lows in recent months, with the company also raising dividends for eight consecutive years.


Analysts are also bullish on Medical Properties, with 12 buys and two holds, according to Bloomberg. A consensus target price of $24.33 per share represents a 7.5% upside in the share price.


The current annualized dividend yield stands at a healthy 5%. Plus, income investors can further enhance the yield on the stock through the use of covered calls.


What Is A Covered Call?: Setting It Up In MPW Stock
---------------------------------------------------



Let's look at how a covered call trade on MPW might take shape.


During Tuesday's session, buying 100 shares of MPW would cost around $2,250. An April 24 strike call option traded yesterday around $0.50, generating $50 in premium per contract.


Selling the call option generates an income of 2.3% in just under four months, equaling 7.3% annualized. That is in addition to the 5% annual dividend yield.


If MPW closes above 24 on the expiration date, the shares will be called away at 24, leaving the trader with a total profit of $200 — that is, a gain of $150 on the shares plus the $50 option premium received, plus a quarterly dividend that could be paid in February 2022.


That equates to at least a 9.1% return, or 29.4% on an annualized basis, or more, depending on the dividend situation.


Risk Vs. Reward
---------------


Of course, the risk with the trade is that MPW stock might drop, which could wipe out any gains made from selling the call.


Investors looking to increase their income can use covered calls and [cash-secured puts](https://www.investors.com/research/options/finding-yield-with-a-cash-secured-put-on-pfizer-stock-annualized-return-could-top-18/) on rich-dividend-paying stocks.


MPW stock is ranked ninth in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 80, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 45 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 72.


This [covered call idea](https://www.investors.com/research/options/abbvie-stock-pounded-how-to-make-15-percent-annualized-return-with-covered-call/) on ABBV stock worked well. Hopefully this one will do the same.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**CME Group** ([CME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CME)) is reducing trading hours for livestock futures, the latest measure taken by the Chicago-based exchange in response to beef producers who say there is too much volatility and undue influence from high-frequency traders.


A working group will be formed with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association to examine more changes in trading, including setting up so-called circuit breakers to pause the market, CME Group said Wednesday in a statement. The change in hours was “based on customer requests,” said CME, the owner of the world’s largest futures market.


CME Chairman Terry Duffy said at a cattle industry conference in January that he would push for changes in livestock markets to curb volatility that beef producers say make it harder to hedge their financial risk effectively. Last month, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said that high-frequency trading and wide price swings made futures “more of a liability than a benefit.”


“Nothing is more important to us than the integrity of our markets, which help farmers and ranchers to discover prices and transfer risk,” Tim Andriesen, CME Group managing director of agricultural products, said Wednesday in the statement.


Effective Feb. 29, futures and options in cattle, hogs and feeder cattle on CME Globex will trade from 8:30 a.m. to 1:05 p.m. Chicago time, Monday through Friday, pending approval from regulators. Options trading by open outcry will be from 8:30 a.m. to 1:02 p.m.


On most days currently, electronic trading runs from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.


In December, a measure of volatility in cattle futures soared to the highest since 2004, while prices increasingly reached daily trading limits. That deterred cattle owners from using the derivatives to protect against price swings, the 28,000-member beef association said in a letter to the exchange Jan. 13.


CME Group said its data show that traders not using high-frequency techniques have triggered wide price swings. Duffy said the cattle market may be “broken” because transactions have slumped in cash markets, a benchmark for futures.


High-frequency trading accounted for 10% of average daily volume in cattle in 2015, CME Group said at the January industry conference.

The last time this column wrote about IBD 50 constituent **Questcor Pharmaceutical**  ([QCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOR)) was in an article discussing the bearish risk reversal as a means to "collar" an existing long stock position. The analysis couldn't have been timelier. 

  

The July 9 article immediately preceded a 22% slump in shares tied to a report from short-selling boutique Citron Research. Analysts from Citron wrote they expected shares of QCOR to trade in the single digits by early 2013 due to questionable marketing tactics regarding its sole drug Acthar. Today, bulls awoke to a second dose of unwanted news taken very seriously and the sort looking to side with Citron Research. 

  

This morning insurer **Aetna** ([AET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AET)) put out a clinical policy bulletin refusing coverage of Acthar stating its efficacy beyond West Syndrome wasn't proven to be effective for other conditions. Following the release and maybe unsurprising, Citron Research chimed in with additional bearish prognostications regarding Questcor's business prospects. 

  

  

Well, if you didn't listen to them i.e. Citron Research originally, we hope if you were listening to QCOR's stock chart which dangled a corrective, cup-shaped base to tempt bulls with, you at least paid attention to our prior lesson about the use of limited risk collars. While it might not look like much or more aptly, not much like a collar as QCOR is so far below the strikes, this three-lot does emphasis what actual definitive or preventative medicine for portfolios is all about when it matters most.

**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) is currently showing one of the highest RSI readings of all S&P 500 stocks. The current reading of 78.93 has not been seen on Goldman Sachs stock since late 2020. And in just over a month, GS has rallied from 290 to 390.




With such a high RSI (Relative Strength Index) reading, it's unlikely that GS will rally much more in the short term. But, for such a strong stock, it's also unlikely that it will drop too much.


What I'm thinking in this scenario: try an unbalanced iron condor in Goldman Sachs stock with a slightly bearish bias. To achieve this, use a wider price spread between the two call options than the spread between the two puts.


As a reminder, an iron condor combines a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


Goldman Stock Today: Setting Up The Spreads
-------------------------------------------



First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Dec. 16 expiry, we could sell the put option in Goldman Sachs stock with a 355 strike price and buy the 350 put. That spread could be sold Tuesday for around $0.75.


Then set up the bear call spread. Place it by selling the 415 call and buying the 425 call. This spread traded around $0.90.


Notice that the call spread has a 10-point width between the two strike prices. As for the put options, the spread is only five points wide. So, this gives the overall trade a slight bearish bias, but also more risk on the upside.


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1.65, good for $165 of premium.


Risk Vs. Reward
---------------


The profit zone ranges between 353.35 and 416.65. This can be calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


Therefore, if we take the premium ($165) divided by the maximum risk ($835 in the case of the two calls if GS stock traded above 425), this iron condor trade in Goldman Stock gives the potential to return 19.8%. A stop loss in this case might be calculated based on 25% of capital at risk, so a loss of around $210.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), GS ranks No. 1 in its money center bank group. Goldman Sachs stock also sports a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 87, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 58 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 89.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

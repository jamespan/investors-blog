Gold has a valuable place in every investor's portfolio, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Gold provides a natural hedge against inflation and is a safe haven investment during severe economic stress.




This has been evident recently with the SPDR Gold ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) rising from 136 to about 162 since a low on March 16.


Today, I want to share a strategy where you can use options to gain exposure to the price of gold without having to buy physical gold or the ETF.


The strategy is called a synthetic long stock and it involves selling an at-the-money put and buying an at-the-money call.


With the ETF trading at 162.50, traders could sell a December 162 put for around $8.85 and buy a December 162 call for $9.60


Therefore, this December synthetic long stock trade would cost only 75 cents per contract, or $75.


Synthetic Long Stock Trade
--------------------------


A synthetic long position has a similar exposure to owning 100 shares of the underlying ETF. That exposure would cost about $16,250 if the investor bought 100 shares.


Despite the fact this trade can be placed for a low cost, the exposure is still large given the inherent leverage in the options.


Even though the option trade only costs $75, the investor could still lose $16,320 if the gold ETF went to $0.


The advantage of the trade is that an equivalent exposure to owning 100 shares can be gained for only a fraction of the cost.


For this synthetic long position, the margin requirement would be around $4,200 so the investor could use the leverage power of options to trade multiple synthetic long positions with the same amount of capital required to purchase 100 shares.


Gold Trade Similar To One For Netflix
-------------------------------------


Of course, leverage is a double-edge sword and if the stock drops, losses will be magnified. We [looked at a similar idea](https://www.investors.com/research/options/netflix-stock-how-to-trade-options-how-synthetic-long-stock-trade-makes-money/) on **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stock back in May and that trade is doing well with the stock moving from 420 to 447.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment. This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation. Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

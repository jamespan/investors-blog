Cloud-related stocks received a booster shot Tuesday with word **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) was acquiring privately held cloud play newScale for an undisclosed amount of cash. In sympathy **F5 Networks**  ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) vaulted into the NASDAQ 100's percentage leaders top spot, albeit from a lowly bearish looking flag pattern caught below 200-day simple moving average resistance. 

  

Looking a bit friendlier in its current base construction, shares of fellow cloud play **Rackspace Hosting**  ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)) pushed forward by 2.37% and near the highs of its seven plus week cup-shaped base. At a closing price of $39.72, RAX is a bit more than 2% from a formal breakout of pattern and all-time highs of $40.62. 

  

That didn't seem to stop at least a couple option traders from cheating, umm participating in front of potential new highs and despite the fact the broader market is still "under correction." One sizable spread that looks to have been put up was the May 38 / 41 vertical on 1,000 contracts. 

  

Without checking for prints, we can assume its transaction to be true by noting negligible open interest, no other sizable interest on the session, as well as implieds not really moving too hard one way or the other on the day and suggestive of a more vega neutral strategy. 

  

One other brawny-looking player, which may or may not be a bull, appears to have positioned with a conversion. The neutral spread composed of equal parts long stock, a short call and long put on the same strike is a way to maintain long stock without the directional risk due to the offsetting short synthetic. In RAX, the trade looks to have been put up 5,000 times on the June 40 strike. 

  

Traders might establish this type spread when a core position, which may be an existing directional or volatility based holding, might require selling stock in order to properly hedge in the future. With stocks such as RAX, which maintains heavy short interest of 19.00%, an attached 7.50 days-to-cover ratio and a high put skew indicative of the issue being potentially hard-to-borrow. That guy or gal may be "cheating" on the charts but not where it matters most with other market-related authorities known as the SEC.

The unstoppable juggernaut that is the [confirmed stock market uptrend](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx) continues rolling on. I'm sure it will end at some point. This is why [stop losses](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/) on bullish option trades are so important — as is focusing on the strongest and highest-rated stocks.




One such stock is **United Therapeutics** ([UTHR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UTHR)) with a Relative Strength Rating of 93 and a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 86, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-united-therapeutics-corp-uthr.aspx).


UTHR stock is also showing on my [MarketSmith scan](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF) for breaking out of a [cup without handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 117.08 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) on May 12.


The chart looks good to me with the stock also showing accumulation and holding above the 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Strong support exists at the 120 price point. The 20-day moving average is around 119. So that can be our line in the sand if our bullish trade isn't working.


United Therapeutics Stock: A Bullish Option Trade
-------------------------------------------------



Let's assume a trader thinks UTHR stock will stay above 120 between now and the July 17 options expiration. The trader could execute a 120-115 bull put spread.


A [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/bull-put-spreads-i/) is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


The July-expiring put with a 120 strike price recently traded around $3.30 and the 115 put was around $1.90. Selling this bull put spread — selling the 120 put, buying the 115 put — would generate approximately $140 in option premium per contract.


This trade offers a 38.9% return potential in just over one month, provided UTHR closes above 120 at expiration. The maximum profit on the trade would be the premium received, or $140 per contract.


What's The Risk?
----------------


To calculate the maximum potential loss, we take the difference in the spread (5) less the premium received (1.40) which gives 3.60, then we multiply that by 100 to get the dollar value of $360.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wOPTIONS060920-300x170.jpg)The spread would achieve the maximum profit if United Therapeutics stock closes above 120 on July 17. In this case the entire spread would expire worthless. This allows the premium seller to keep the $140 in total option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if UTHR closes below 115 on July 17. The premium seller would lose $360 on the trade.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 118.60. We calculate this as 120 less the $1.40 option premium per contract.


The bid-ask spread is a little wide on this one so it may be hard to get filled near the midpoint.


If the stock breaks below 120 I would close the trade to try and limit losses, otherwise hold until expiry and try to achieve the full profit.

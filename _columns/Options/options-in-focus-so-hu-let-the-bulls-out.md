Last week when we left off discussing the prospects for more than a few long call buyers jumping into a breakout Wednesday morning in **Sohu.com** ([SOHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOHU)), where things or umm profits were looking less than terrific. In fact, our focus, the well-traded out-of-the money June 110 call went from an assumed average purchase price of $2.10 to close at $1.45 and a loss of more than 30% in just one session as shares closed nearly 4% below the proper buy point. 

  

While certainly not great action to start, the softer delta play did allow some traders to stay the course if they used a 50% stop loss rule in keeping with our own words of encouragement that day. As it turns out, it was the right move this time out. Bears quickly backed off and bulls pushed shares up for three straight sessions to fresh all-time highs and now up about 7.5% above the pivot and beyond IBD's "buying range" of 5%. 

  

"If it's out of buying range, does that mean it's a sale or short?" Not necessarily, but for long call holders in the likes of the June 110 call, there's certainly an abundance of different option adjustments to seriously consider. At this point, premiums are such that this trader could either lock in solid profits and / or drastically reduce open risk while keeping one's sights set on more profits and higher prices. 

  

  

One easy adjustment that eliminates virtually all the existing dollar risk while still allowing for large upside but capped gains is for the trader to use a "sell to open" order with a higher strike call in the same contract month as the long call. If the trader chooses the June 120 call as depicted above with two contracts, the resulting position is a regular, but very nicely legged vertical. 

  

With this particular position, while dollar risk has been all but eliminated, the trader might still want to be careful about holding the spread too long if shares began to correct. In the end this spread is still well out-of-the-money and could have trouble gaining value if momentum begins to dry up. So while current price and time factors are quite favorable, instead of beating one's chest on how they can't lose, continue to stay a step ahead and prepare for an even better defense or exit strategy in case analyst commentary asks once more, "SO-HU Let the Bears Out?"

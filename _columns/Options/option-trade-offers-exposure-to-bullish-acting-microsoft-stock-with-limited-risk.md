**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) had a huge day Wednesday, bouncing 6.16% and closing at the high of the day. 




Microsoft stock is holding nicely above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), which has flattened out and is starting to rise.


One way to take a bullish exposure without risking too much capital is via a bull call spread. A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Bull Call Spread On Microsoft
-----------------------------


Going out to the February expiration, a 265-strike call option was trading around $10.45 yesterday, and the 270 call was around $8.35.


Buying the 265 call and selling the 270 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $210 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). The maximum potential profit would be $290 (the difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if Microsoft stock closes below 265 on Feb. 17, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $210 premium paid. 



Potential gains are also capped above 270, so no matter how high MSFT stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $290.


Close Trade If Stock Falls Below 235
------------------------------------


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 235, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Microsoft stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 57, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 88 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 37.


Microsoft is due to report earnings toward the end of January, so this trade would have earnings risk if held until then.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

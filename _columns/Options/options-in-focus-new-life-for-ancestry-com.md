Growth traders having the quick wherewithal this morning to hop on board shares of **Ancestry.com** ([ACOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACOM)) as it made a fast breakout above its February all-time and weekly base highs, are enjoying life a bit more than otherwise if still long the stock. 

  

Since breaking out above $38.79 forty minutes into the session, shares of ACOM have rallied an additional 17% to about 45.50. With the stock already 12% beyond any approachable buy point and more than double many stock traders' initial managed risk of 7% to 8%; it seems more than an adequate time to book at least partial profits. But if you happen to be in position to do that, a hedge with one of ACOM's calls or puts or maybe better yet, both, might be considered first. 

  

Contract volume in Friday's powerful session was up to nearly 21,000 with calls favored by a three to one margin with less than half an hour left in the session. Typically, but likely to improve, trading activity is at a much more benign 500 contracts per day. Liquidity is still spotty with surrounding money quoted markets showing bid / ask spreads of $0.10 to $.30 in the front two months. Beyond June conditions worsen and honestly need to improve before longer-term hedging becomes appealing. 

  

With conditions as they are, choices are limited but with the use of limit orders and maybe willing to give up a bit more than fair value, a trader might see the use of outrights, two legged spreads such as verticals, calendars or risk reversals as a different option, pardon the pun, to reducing risk and profiteering in shares of ACOM.

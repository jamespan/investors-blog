Earnings season is winding down, but there are still some big names due to give earnings reports this week. 




Let's take a look at the expected range for some key stocks. 


As a reminder, to calculate the expected range, look up the option chain and add together the price of the at-the-money put option and the at-the-money call option. Use the first expiry date *after*the earnings date.


While this approach is not as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate. 


Let's look at some of this week's big names and the expected ranges according to the options market: 


Monday
------


**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) expected range 8.5% 


Tuesday
-------


**Futu Holdings** ([FUTU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FUTU)) 12.1% 


**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) 7.6% 


Wednesday
---------


**Campbell Soup** ([CPB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CPB)) 4.8% 


**Chewy** ([CHWY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHWY)) 8.2% 


**Veeva** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) 7% 


**Asana** ([ASAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ASAN)) 12.8% 


**ChargePoint** ([CHPT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CHPT)) 9.9%

Option traders can use these expected moves to structure trades. Bearish traders can look at selling bear call spreads outside the expected range. 


Bullish traders can sell [bull put spreads](https://www.investors.com/research/options/what-is-a-bull-put-spread-nvidia-stock-wells-fargo-stock-options-trading/) outside the expected range, or look at [bullish calendar spreads](https://www.investors.com/research/options/snap-stock-offers-opportunity-for-bullish-calendar-spread/). A few weeks ago, [we looked at a bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/wells-fargo-stock-is-up-63-percent-this-year-can-this-put-option-trade-return-25-percent/) on **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), which can now be closed for almost the full profit. [An earnings bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/nvidia-stock-option-traders-eye-bull-put-spread-ahead-of-earnings/) on **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) expired for a full profit. 


Neutral traders can look at iron condors. [This example](https://www.investors.com/research/options/how-trading-an-iron-condor-option-strategy-in-amd-stock-could-yield-33-percent-return/) from **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) has achieved almost the full profit potential and can be closed early. 


When trading options over earnings, it is best to stick to risk-defined strategies and keep position size small. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Lumber Liquidators Holdings founder Tom Sullivan has boosted his stake in the flooring retailer that he wants to acquire.




On Wednesday, Sullivan executed call options through his F9 Investments LLC fund at $10 a share, increasing his stake to 7.7% from about 6%.


The stock rose as much as 11% to $11.18 on Thursday, bringing its two-day advance to almost 20%.


Sullivan told Bloomberg that he's in talks with private-equity firms and banks about taking the retailer private and merging it with his current company, Cabinets To Go. Since then, he's received additional interest from potential partners, he said Thursday in an interview.


Lumber Liquidators hasn't responded to him yet, he added.



**Lumber Liquidators** ([LL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LL)) didn't respond to a request for comment. The company hasn't addressed a Bloomberg report on Sept. 3 that Sullivan is pursuing an acquisition.

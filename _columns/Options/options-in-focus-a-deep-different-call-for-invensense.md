IBD 50 constituent, recent IPO and semiconductor outfit **InvenSense** ([INVN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INVN)) is up about 7.5% in the final minutes of trade Monday, topping our "unusual volume" radar based on those stocks average daily call and put activity using a 50-day simple moving average.

  

Compared to an average tally of about 560 contracts, today's strong move helped produce volume of more than 8,300 with calls favored by a strong three-to-one margin. Headline drivers were all but absent today, but a short cup-shaped base breakout following a successful test of 50-day simple moving average support on strong volume was nonetheless apparent.

  

On the option side, somewhat surprising but possibly a good omen for the breakout which is trading fractionally below a buy point of 19.44, a good deal of Monday's apparent enthusiasm was aimed at the March 15 call. The action was unusual due to the contract having just four days left until expiration, being deep in-the-money and maintaining virtually no open interest compared to today's volume of more than 2,100. 

  

Net, net we can infer traders, and a handful of larger operators amongst that group, are opening positions with a directional axe to grind in a short period of time. What we don't know definitively is whether they're actually bulls or not. Say what!!?? Ultimately, it would be nice to know for certain what those traders were doing today, but all we can say emphatically is it takes two sides to consummate a trade.

  

In the end, this type of deeper in-the-money activity may have involved bulls long stock already; maybe from last week's heavy volume confirmation of 50-day simple moving average support and now looking to hedge those gains with a legged buy-write. I realize that's blasphemy to those playing the breakout. But remember and once more, it takes two to put up a trade here as well. Yet with varied interests and views which often go beyond a chart's buy point, we can accept "selling to open" may make some real sense and more than just cents to quite a few traders today.

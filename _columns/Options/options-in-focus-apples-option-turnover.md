IBD 50 constituent and the world's largest company **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is staging a fairly convincing move Thursday with shares closing up nearly 2% in heavy trading. News of a smaller and less expensive iPad in the works for later this year looks to be driving today's bullish price action, which also appears to have gotten the attention of option traders.

  

Compared to daily average volume of about 147,000, Apple's contract count is approaching 725,000. Thursday's put/call ratio of 0.65 which tells us calls are favored by about 1.5-to-1.0 over puts is fairly common. A bit more than one-half of today's net volume is a combination of Weeklys July's expiring tomorrow and the "July Week 2" contract which came on the board this morning. 

  

Incidentally and with regards to tomorrow's Weeklys that are expiring, that event isn't stopping trader enthusiasm for opening fresh positions. Volume levels are swamping existing open interest in the likes of its at-the-money 610 call and today's most active contract. By the numbers, more than 47,000 of those calls have traded compared to 8,800 residing in the contract, while the 610 puts have seen heavy volume of 24,000 versus 729 on the board. 

  

Implied volatilies ranged from the low-20s to low 30s. The August contract, which contains Apple's earnings release in its cycle, was priced most dearly. Roughly 30% IV in August has premiums roughly in the bottom one-third of implieds during the past year for the 30 â€” 60 day ATMs in AAPL. Compared to longer-term statistical or underlying volatility, those premiums are fairly priced but appear rich versus short-term movement in the stock which is nearer to the 20% area.

  

As for Thursday's "most active" contract, if a bull is betting on quick continued follow-through by AAPL shares with a long call strategy, the ultra-short-term right to ownership at 610 would cost a trader $3.90. Roughly 70% of the call's value is built of time premium, while maintaining a breakeven of 613.90 and double price of 617.80 versus AAPL stock at 611.10 late in the session. As readers might appreciate, this type of bull has little if any room for error versus spreads such as a more flexible vertical and all of its varietals; some of which even allow for gains when a long call holder might be feeling definite pain all too quickly.

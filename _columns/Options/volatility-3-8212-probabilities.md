This is the third in a series of articles on volatility. The goal of this series is to clarify the different meanings of the term *volatility* and to discuss its many possible uses, including describing stock price action, evaluating option prices, choosing option strategies, and forecasting the market. Option traders should strive to gain an accurate understanding of volatility — and its many uses — because volatility affects option prices, trading decisions and risk analysis.

  

This article discusses some probability calculations that are derived from the standard normal distribution, which is better known as the bell-shaped curve. These probabilities estimate the chances that a stock price will touch or close beyond a particular level on or prior to a particular date. Some probabilities help stock traders pick price targets, and some probabilities help option traders choose strike prices and points at which to adjust positions. Trading decisions should be based on many factors, but probabilities can be a helpful one.

  

**Brief Review of Standard Deviation**

  

The stated volatility percentage, 25%, for example, is the annual standard deviation of stock price movement. From statistics about normal distributions (bell-shaped curves), approximately 68% of all outcomes occur within one standard deviation of the mean at the end of the time period. Also, approximately 95% of all outcomes occur within two standard deviations of the mean at the end of the time period, and approximately 99% of outcomes occur within three standard deviations at the end of the time period.

  

Since price-range probabilities for one year are not useful to short-term traders the following formula converts the stated volatility — the annual standard deviation — to a period of time chosen by the trader:

  

Standard Deviation for *n* days = Stock Price \* Volatility \* square root of time  
Where square root of time =   
square root of *n* days / square root of days per year 

  

**Using Volatility**

  

Consider a situation in which a trader named Jean is bullish on Stock XYZ over the next month, or 20 trading days. If XYZ is trading at $70 and has a volatility of 25%, then Jean can calculate the 20-day standard deviation for XYZ as follows:

  

70 \* 0.25 \* square root (20/256) = 70 \* 0.25 \* 4.47/15.9 = 4.92

  

In this example, Jean can realistically predict that stock XYZ will reach or move beyond $74.92, because the statistics of volatility indicate there is a 32% chance that XYZ will change in price by more than 4.92. Jean has to get the direction right, and there is still the risk that this time period will be one of the 68% of time periods that the stock price does not close beyond the one-standard deviation level. 

  

**Probabilities of Touching**

  

But are Jean's chances of success only 32% if she gets the direction right? After all, the statistics at expiration do not describe the path that the price of XYZ follows between now and the end of Jean's 20-day time period.

  

The probabilities revealed by volatility also indicate the chances that the price of the underlying will reach a given level at some time prior to the end of the time period. These are known as the probabilities of touching. Here are some of the most commonly used probabilities derived from volatility:

  

  
2. At expiration, 68% chance underlying will **close** between 1 SD up and 1 SD down
  
4. At expiration, 95% chance underlying will **close** between 2 SD up and 2 SD down
  
6. At expiration, 99% chance underlying will **close** between 3 SD up and 3 SD down
  
8. Prior to expiration, 99% chance underlying will **touch** 0.5 SD, up or down
  
10. Prior to expiration, 54% chance underlying will **touch** 1 SD, up or down
  
12. Prior to expiration, 22% chance underlying will **touch** 1.5 SD, up or down
  
14. Prior to expiration, 7% chance underlying will **touch** 2 SD, up or down
  
16. Prior to expiration, 58% chance underlying will **close** beyond 1 SD after **touching** 1SD
  
18. Prior to expiration, 14% chance underlying will **touch** 0.5 SD **both** up and down

  

#5 and #8 apply directly to Jean's situation. #5 states there is a 54% chance that the stock price will touch up or down one standard deviation prior to the end of her 20-day time forecast. So, if Jean gets the direction correct, there is a 54% chance that XYZ will reach 74.92.

  

A second question is, "Should Jean hold or close her XYZ stock if it reaches 74.92?" #8 indicates a 58% chance that the price will continue beyond 74.92 once it touches that level. But should Jean simply hold because of the 58% chance? Absolutely not! This is where a trader's judgment takes over. If Jean senses that XYZ will continue its move, maybe because the whole market is moving up, maybe because XYZ's sector has strong relative strength, or maybe because a recent report was bullish; then, and only then, should Jean continue to hold.

  

**Using Probabilities**

  

Probabilities derived from volatility can help traders in a number of ways. They can help in setting price targets for new trades. They can give a trader a completely dispassionate probability that something really good — or really bad — can happen. Traders can also compare their personal level of confidence to the unemotional percentage chances provided by volatility. These probabilities are only another input to the trading decision making process. The information probabilities provide must be balanced against subjective information that traders use in every trading decision.

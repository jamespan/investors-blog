Last Thursday we discussed IBD 50 constituent and discount variety store operator **Dollar General**  ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)). There was some decent-sized, hypothesized call buying in the slightly out-of-the-money June 50 call as shares staged a base-on-base breakout in front of Monday nightâ€™s earnings release, which caught our attention. That day, average contract volume of about 450 surged to more than 2,200 contracts with a full 50% of the activity concentrated in the fore-mentioned call.

  

While we couldn't be absolutely certain call buyers were behind the volume due to roughly matching open interest and a bit of pressure on implieds, the contract's pricing, most of which went up for $0.80 to $0.85 and required a move of just 5% in order to double made enough technical sense as a potential breakout, particularly so with earnings on tap. 

  

It turns out traders were indeed opening positions that day as open interest increased by about 750. Those that bought the call received a beneficial "earnings rush" as implieds picked up from 32% to 49% proved a modest boon. The June 50 call managed to close at $1.00 versus Thursday's finish of $0.85 despite both a slight decline in share price and theta for the four calendar days leading into the earnings event. 

  

The bad news for traders that held through the report, and based on open interest most appear to have made that commitment; the call has lost the bulk of its value. A combination of long delta, vega and theta risks all conspired to pressure the now firmly out-of-the-money contract to finish at just $0.15. Unfortunately, despite topping both bottom and top-line views and one broker even raising their price target from $51 to $60 a share, the company succumbed to one of those "sell the news" or "profit-taking" reactions. 

  

Traders might take solace in some of today's 3.57% "profit-taking" as the result of an announced 25 million share secondary rather than mixed guidance; though the kind determined to be "conservative" by BMO Capital. But for option traders positioned in our featured limited risk speculation, the only real comfort in that quickly "wasted asset" is previously discussed smaller and manageable sizing means most of those bulls are out-of-some-money but not expired in full.

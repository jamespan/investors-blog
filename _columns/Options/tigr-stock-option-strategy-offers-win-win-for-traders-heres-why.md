**Up Fintech Holding** ([TIGR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIGR)) has already logged an impressive gain for the year. Even with a dramatic correction. So how do you profit on TIGR stock if you don't want to pay the current price, around 28? A cash-secured put gives you some alternate options.

It's always important to look at the charts of top stocks to see if they are extended.


In the case of TIGR stock, it reached a high of 38.50 in February and is currently around 28 with a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) of 30.03.

It also has an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 69, and a [Relative Price Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99.


So if you wanted to own TIGR stock, but only at a lower price, what could you do? One way to take ownership of a stock for less than the current price is via an option strategy called a cash-secured put.


Setting Up A Cash-Secured Put Option
------------------------------------


A cash-secured put is a neutral to slightly bullish trade. Less bullish than buying the stock outright.


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option. At the same time, you set aside enough cash to buy the stock at your strike price.


If TIGR stock stays at a high price, the put expires worthless and you keep the premium.


Should TIGR stock fall below the strike price of the put you sold, expect to be assigned the shares.


The good news is not only do you acquire the stock at a lower price, the premium collected helps offset some of your cost even more.

Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start with options. They are like a covered call and are pretty easy to understand once you know the basics.


Traders selling puts should understand that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price. Make sure you are OK with owning the stock.


Option Strategy Details For TIGR Stock
--------------------------------------


Let's fill in the details with TIGR stock.



With the stock trading at 28.32 yesterday, investors could sell a Dec. 17-expiring put with a strike price of 20. That costs around $2.05 per share.


An investor selling this put would receive $205 into their account. That's theirs to keep if the position is held.


Be ready to buy 100 shares of TIGR stock at 20 if it falls below that level. However, you reduce the effective net cost for those shares. Subtracting the option premium received from the purchase of 100 shares at 20 gives a cost of just $1,795.


That's more than a 10% discount on the strike price and 36.6% below yesterday's closing price. For a lot of traders, either of those scenarios works, making it a win-win.


Profits And Losses
------------------


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls quickly, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the premium received helps offset any losses.


The worst-case scenario occurs if TIGR stock falls to zero. This cash-secured put strategy would see the trade lose $1,795. Most traders would cut losses long before then. While not good, it's better than the $2,832 hit from picking up the shares outright at yesterday's closing price.


If the stock stays above 20 at expiry, the put expires worthless and you pocket the $205 premium. That leaves the trader with an 11.4% return on capital at risk, or 24.4% annualized.


Cash-secured puts are a great way to generate a return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership.


If the put does get assigned, you have a reduced cost basis. At that point, you could sell covered calls to generate additional income from the position.


Remember options are risky. Investors can lose 100% of their investment.

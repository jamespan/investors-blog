When most people think of [dividend and income strategies](https://www.investors.com/dividend-and-income-investing/), income-generating options strategies are not what come to mind. Options have a bad reputation. They're seen as largely speculative, highly leveraged instruments reserved for the reckless and get-rich-quick ilk. But that's not necessarily so. As with most things, it's the strategies you use to manage your risk that will determine your potential for long-term performance. And how much volatility you accept in your options investments is up to you.


What Is An Options Contract?
----------------------------


When an investor buys an options contract, they purchase the right to lock in a price (called the strike price) of an underlying security. For call options you gain the right to buy (or call away) shares from the option seller at the strike price. For put options, you have the right to sell (or put) shares to the option seller.


You pay for those rights, but they are only good for a limited time. Every options contract comes with an expiration date. Time works against you when you're the buyer of an options contract. The contract loses value the closer you get to expiration. In fact, the loss in value speeds up as your time runs out.


Income-Generating Options Strategies
------------------------------------


So how can you use options to [make money](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/personal-finance/high-dividend-stocks)? When you become a seller of options, you get to collect the premium that the buyers pay. Since you are putting yourself under obligation to buy or sell a security at the strike price, you deserve compensation. In essence, you can turn any company with options into an income generator. It's like creating your own dividend.


If you set up your strategy right, you also have a high probability of success. Think about it. Buyers of options usually have to be right on the direction of the underlying stock in order to make money. Call buyers want the underlying stock to go up, put buyers want the stock to go down.


When you sell an option (also referred to as writing an option), you want the underlying stock to go in the opposite direction. Buy you also win if it goes sideways or doesn't move far enough against you. More ways to win increases your probability of success. So why doesn't everyone take these high-probability trades? There's a catch. You can really get hurt if you don't manage risk. One low-probability loss can be large enough to wipe out many high-probability gains if you ignore risk.


One way to control risk is to avoid writing naked calls. Writing a naked call means you have the obligation to sell shares if the strike price is surpassed at expiration, but you don't own the stock. No matter how the underlying stock goes, you must buy the shares in order to deliver on your obligation to sell at the strike price. Since a stock has no limit on how high it can go, you are exposed to unlimited risk. That's why you can't sell naked calls in Individual Retirement Accounts.


Managing Risk Using Covered Calls
---------------------------------


Of all the income-generating options strategies, the most popular is covered calls. A covered call means you've sold a call option, but your risk is "covered" because you own the shares. You get the benefit of selling the call option and collecting the premium. You collect the income, but you still own the stock. You can do the strategy multiple times, say every month, as long as the stock doesn't go above your strike price. It's an ideal strategy to use on a stock that is trading in a range or maybe a long-term holding that is forming a base.


Time works against the option buyer, but it works in your favor as an option seller. If you choose an option with just a month or so until expiration, the value will decrease more as the expiration date approaches. Decreasing value means you will be keeping more of the premium. If the stock is below the strike price once you reach the expiration date, you keep the whole premium and you still own the stock. Or you can also close out the option position early by buying the same number of contracts at the same strike price and expiration.


In either case, you are free to sell another round of contracts and collect premium again. Lather, rinse, repeat and now you've got an income-generating option strategy. It's like getting passive income from a rental property.


Assessing Risk For Covered Calls
--------------------------------


Nothing comes for free, so what's the catch? When using income-generating options strategies, you are often receiving income today by giving up the opportunity for larger profits in the future. If the stock jumps 100 points, the good news is you already own the shares to fulfill your obligation to sell. The bad news? You capped your profit potential at your strike price. Any price gains beyond the strike price belong to the option purchaser who would call those shares away from you.


If you chose your strike price based on a price target at which you would sell anyway, it's not much different from a stock trade. But some people still cringe at selling something below its market price. Your premium received may pale in comparison to the profits that could have been.


The loss of opportunity is not the only risk. There's always the chance that the stock will go down to zero. Using income-generating options strategies reduce that risk compared to just owning the stock alone. The premium you receive offsets some of the sting you would suffer with a stock loss. If you bought a stock for $100 and it drops to $95, you have a $5 loss. But if you sell a covered call and receive a premium, say of $1, you reduce your loss by the amount of the premium received. You still have the loss, just not as much. Just like with any stock purchase, you should still [use a stop loss for your stock](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/use-stop-loss.asp). The income-generating options strategies can lose all their benefits and then some if the stock loss gets away from you.


Options Platforms
-----------------


Several brokerages have options platforms that offer extensive education to help you learn how to trade them for income. Many give you the ability to set up a single trade, like the covered call, to execute multiple transactions (in this case, buying the stock and selling a call option at the same time. They also do much of the math for you in calculating theoretical values from different pricing models, provided statistical evaluation tools like the "Greeks," risk graphs, and more. With those extra tools, you can quickly sift through investing choices. This helps you control just how much risk you take. Among the most popular platforms are those that have been ranked among top brokerages in IBD's annual [Best Online Brokers](https://www.investors.com/best-online-brokers/) survey: This year the [top ranked online brokers for options traders](https://www.investors.com/news/best-online-brokers/best-online-brokers-for-options-active-traders-etfs-high-net-worth-investors/) are Fidelity, **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)), **TD Ameritrade** ([AMTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMTD)), **Interactive Brokers** ([IBKR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IBKR)) and **E-Trade** ([ETFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETFC)).

**Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) is having a stellar year and is currently up over 59%.


At the same time, implied volatility is very high at 39.02%, which gives Delta Air Lines stock an implied volatility (IV) percentile of 81%.


That just means the current level of IV is higher than 81% of all other occurrences in the last 12 months.


As option traders, we can take advantage of that high volatility by selling a short strangle.




A short strangle involves selling an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the-money call with the same strike price with the same expiration date.


This trade generates a large amount of premium for the option seller, but it does come with risks. A short strangle is an unprotected trade, sometimes referred to as a "naked" trade. Naked options can be risky because they expose the trader to potentially unlimited losses.


However, if the trader is right and the stock trades sideways, the trader gets to keep the full premium.


Assuming a trader believes that Delta Air Lines stock will trade sideways over the next few weeks. He or she could sell a Nov. 29, 60 put and a Nov. 29, 68 call.


Delta Air Lines Trade Generates $175 In Premium
-----------------------------------------------


The 60 put could be sold for around $0.80 and the 68 call could be sold for around $0.95.



Selling those two options would generate a total of $175 in premium. That is the maximum possible gain on the trade if Delta stock closes between 60 and 68 on the day of expiration.


To work out the break-even price of the trade, take the lower strike price of 60 minus the total premium received of $1.75, which gives 58.25.


Then on the call side, take the call strike and add the premium, which gives 69.75.


This trade is a short vega trade. That means if implied volatility increases early in the trade, losses could occur.


Short strangles are an advanced option strategy, so if all that sounds confusing, it's best not to trade them.


With a trade like this the potential losses are unlimited and a lot higher than the potential gains. So traders would want to be very confident that the stock is going to remain flat over the course of the trade.


Exit Strategy For Delta Option Trade
------------------------------------


A stop loss could be placed at the break-even points.


Alternatively, bullish investors could take ownership of the stock if it drops below 60 at expiration.

Shares of IBD 50 constituent **Perrigo** ([PRGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRGO)) were mostly flat in tight trade Friday, but that didn't stop a couple option traders from initiating some rather large positions in the pharmaceutical upstart. 

  

Compared to its daily average volume of about 600, Perrigo saw a bit more than 5,500 contracts in fairly even trade split amongst its calls and puts. Activity was concentrated in the February contracts. Of notice, nearly 600 Feb 100 calls were put up for $1.25 and representing about 60% of the contract's net volume. 

  

Compared to open interest of 2,000 we can't be sure whether the trader was opening or closing, but given earnings are not too far off on February 7, we'd wager the action is opening. The activity in the at-the-money doesn't appear to have been directly to stock and with implieds bid on the session, some speculative buying in front of the report seems likely. 

  

A slightly more interesting but less clear three way also appears to have been established based on all-around smaller existing open interest. At 12:11 EST the following prints occurred:

  

450 of the Feb 110 calls at $0.30 at 12:11  
900 Feb 100 puts @ $6.40 at 12:11  
900 Feb 90 puts @ $1.10 at 12:11 

  

Checking for any attached stock to neutralize the delta of what we'd label quirky spreads such as an unorthodox risk reversal or similarly oddly-positioned strangle with a teaser option synthetic bull call spread, we came up empty-handed.

  

We could also be looking at a simpler, but still odd bear or bull put spread coupled with the smaller sized but still large call. In saying all that and not having a firm grip on the situation ourselves, we honestly would like to hear from readers that might have a clearer take on the action.

  Options In Focus: "VIX" Time It's For Real?

The CBOE Volatility Index has put together more than its fair share of false starts in recent weeks as sentiment has tried to mellow and move back towards more normalized and lower volatility that's generally of benefit to bulls. 

  

By our own estimate, since mid-October there's been four false signals in the VIX based on unsuccessful stabs at pushing the notorious "fear gauge" below its historically overly-fearful 30% level. With the VIX now once again below 30% near 27.5% for a fifth attempt, will five prove the charm? 

  

We certainly hope so. To wit, we see the seasonal tendencies of the "Best Six" calendar period and December's Santa Claus Rally as reason to anticipate that after an extended and nearly unprecedented period of high volatility; a more benign and confident market environment is possible. 

  

Despite our optimism, the market does have an albatross or two hanging on its shoulders. By Investor's Business Daily's own admission, the market is still under correction. Further, the VIX has signaled over the last two days, a short-term overbought condition while the likes of the S&P500 has soared in excess of 7.0% on the week.

  

We're also mindful of that potentially harmful market catalyst called the BLS' nonfarm payrolls report due out Friday morning. Given the circumstances, one option, pardon the pun, to keep any existing gains intact while maintaining upside exposure as conditions maybe neutralize a bit before moving higher, would be the use of a near-term protective put against the portfolio. 

  

By figuring out the beta of one's portfolio, which can be assisted for free with Yahoo! Finance, a trader can guard against broader market risk by purchasing an appropriate level of protection using an at or out-of-the money put in an instrument such as the **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)). With this type positioning, the trader has a better handle on their risk exposure, while maintaining upside profit potential, though reduced by the cost of the purchased protection. 

  

This kind of hedge doesn't guard against company specific risk. Thus, if earnings or something like a FDA announcement are a potential issue, you may want to strongly consider an option strategy in the underlying instrument that's in question. While premiums in those type situations will undoubtedly prove more expensive than with index protection; it probably makes sense and cents over the long run.

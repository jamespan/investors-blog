Is it a stretch to think yesterday's growth leaders could remain in a downward dog-like position on the price chart, even if the broader market regains a more healthy appearance? 

  

It probably takes a bit less to visualize those types of bearish technical consequences if the name in question has seen multiple base counts on the weekly, enjoyed gains in the neighborhood of 3,000% since the 2009 market bottom and hasn't yet approached that all-too-common 70% slip from those often well-cheered and spirited highs. 

  

If the stock in question also maintains a downward dog-like slanted triple top on the weekly combined with a six day bearish flag consolidation below the 200-day simple moving average, traders could be looking at **Lululemon Athletica**  ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)). 

  

With LULU's current base lows roughly 35% from its late July all-time-highs and just half of what many see as a common tumble from excessive cheerleading by overly-bulled up investors; there could be some solid upside for bears willing to position for more than a bit of potential downside. The even better or at least more authoritative report on Lululemon is the name maintains excellent liquidity in its options. 

  

Average daily volume of about 11,000 contracts and quoted markets reflecting bid / ask spreads of $0.05 to $0.15. Further, with strike distances as narrow as 1.25 points, there are more than a few different opportunities for limited risk option strategies in which bears can try suiting up with. Given earnings are out on Thursday before the market open, we'd say regardless of your view on the stock, if you're going to play that game, considering those options, makes all the more sense and likely cents too.

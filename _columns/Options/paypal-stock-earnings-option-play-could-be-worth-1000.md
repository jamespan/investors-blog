**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is looking ready to test and potentially break above its early-September peak of 212.45. Earnings for the online payment company are due after the close on Nov. 2, setting up a potential option trade for profit on PayPal stock.




PayPal Stock Shows Leadership Qualities
---------------------------------------


A quick look at an [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-paypal-holdings-inc-pypl.aspx) on PayPal stock shows a lot of green marks. The strength in both fundamentals and technicals earned PayPal a spot on both [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) as a leading stock in the payment processors group.


With it's current [cup pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), PayPal stock is a good bullish candidate for option traders looking to play a run higher into earnings.


A diagonal call spread can be set up in a similar way to the [poor man's covered call](https://www.investors.com/research/options/veeva-stock-why-this-poor-mans-covered-call-veeva-could-deliver/) we looked at earlier in the week.


The difference? For this trade, the bought call has a shorter time duration. That makes it less expensive.


Diagonal Call Spread Setup
--------------------------


With earnings on Nov. 2, a 190 call expiring Nov. 6 traded around $21.50 yesterday. Selling the Oct. 30 220 call would bring in around $2.60 in premium.


The net cost of the trade at $18.90 per contract equates to $1,890. This is also the maximum risk in the trade.



Potential profits can only be estimated for diagonal spreads. But, it could be around $1,000 to $1,200 if PYPL stock rises to 220 or higher by the end of the month. Even if PayPal stock doesn't move too much higher, the sold call should experience more time decay than the bought call.


This combined position has a delta of 52. That means the option position is roughly equivalent to owning 52 shares of PayPal stock.


Exit Strategy On Option Trade
-----------------------------


As a bullish trade, the risk is that PayPal doesn't perform as expected. If PayPal stock drops, the trade will lose value quickly. I would consider setting a stop loss if PYPL stock dropped through 200 or if the option trade was down 25%.


Just a note of caution. Diagonal spreads are more of an advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners. Options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

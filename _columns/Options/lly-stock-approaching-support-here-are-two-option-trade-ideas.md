In such a strong market, negative action sticks out. **Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) didn't look so great on May 7 but had some support levels to rely on. Here's how you can take advantage of the support in LLY stock with two different option trades.




The Fundamental Side Of LLY Stock
---------------------------------


Eli Lilly is a drug manufacturing company. It discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells pharmaceutical products and animal health products. Leading drugs include Prozac, Methadone and Cialis with strong benefits to LLY stock now and projected in the future.


On April 23, the company [reported first quarter earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-eli-lilly-earnings-q1-2020/) of $1.75 per share on revenue of $5.9 billion. Their numbers easily beat consensus earnings estimates for $1.55 per share on revenue of $5.5 billion. The company is now expecting earnings of $6.70 to $6.90 for 2020 with revenue coming in around $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion. Impressive numbers indeed!


Previous guidance by LLY stock called for earnings in the $6.70 to $6.80 range and the latest expectation is for $6.70 to $6.90. It's clear that management is confident the Covid-19 pandemic will have a positive impact for the pharmaceutical giant.


Strong Ratings For the This Long-Term Leader
--------------------------------------------


The ratings are strong across the board for LLY stock. It's No. 1 in its group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99 — as seen in [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-eli-lilly-and-co-lly.aspx). The [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93, of a best-possible 99, and EPS Rating of 96 are stellar as well. The Earnings Stability factor is a 3 on a 1-99 scale where the lower rating means more stable earnings growth. That qualified Eli Lilly stock for [IBD's Long-Term Leader Portfolio](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/).


With earnings behind it, Eli Lilly joined the [actionable ranks of the Long-Term Leaders](https://www.investors.com/research/eli-lilly-stock-joins-ibds-long-term-leaders-portfolio/). IBD Head Market Strategist Mike Webster wrote that while it was a little extended, "the risk-to-reward ratio makes a half position reasonable. Some may want to wait for a pullback under 155 or wait for an additional buy point."


LLY stock is currently trading above its 50 and 200-day moving averages and those moving averages are sloping upward. That's generally a bullish sign.


While the break below the 20-day moving average on May 7 was negative, there is strong support in the 145 to 150 region.


Option Trade Idea: Bull Put Spread
----------------------------------


With the stock holding up well, investors could look to sell a July 17 135/125 bull put spread. That means you would sell the put at the higher strike price while simultaneously buying a put at the lower strike price. That spread traded for a credit of around 0.95 on Friday.


I would look to put an order in to sell the spread at 1.20. See if LLY stock comes down a bit for the order on the spread to get filled.


This offers a 13.63% return potential in two months, provided Lilly stock is above 135 at expiration.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $120 per contract if LLY stock closes above the short strike of 135 at expiration. Both puts would expire worthless and you keep the premium.


The maximum risk is $880 and would occur if Eli Lilly closes below 135 at the July 17 expiration. That's the spread between the two strike prices less the premium received.


The breakeven point for the bull put spread is 133.80 on LLY stock. That takes the short put of 135 less the $1.20 option premium per contract.


If the spread doesn't get filled, I would just move on to the next opportunity.


Cash Secured Put: Another Option Trade For LLY Stock
----------------------------------------------------


Another idea would be to sell the 135 put as a cash-secured put. This would generate around $2.70 in premium with a breakeven price of 132.30.


This strategy requires a lot more capital as the maximum loss would be $13,230 and would occur if LLY stock went to zero. The 50-day moving average is currently sitting around 144 so that is a potential area to set a stop loss long before your maximum loss is reached.


Similar to the bull put spread idea, if I wanted a bit more margin for error in the trade, I might set up the order around $3.50 instead of $2.70 and wait to see if it gets filled.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.


Good luck this week traders.

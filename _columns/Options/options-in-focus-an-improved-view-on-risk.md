One subtle shift in looking and interpreting an option position's risk is what we like to call the modern view at Optionetics. This risk graph differs from the classic risk graph as it allows a trader to make a stronger visual connection with how profits and losses move in relation to the underlying. In the following, we'd like to compare the classic risk graph to the modern view with the hope readers see this as a meaningful improvement and one worthy of an industry standard. 

  

Shown below to illustrate the old school or classic way of seeing things, let's look at a bull call spread in the always liquid and ready-to-trade, **Apple**  ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) using +1 AAPL September 650 / 660 bull call spread. As shares broke out to record highs today the slightly in-the-money spread was priced for $5.75 with AAPL stock trading near 664. Using the classic industry view of how profits and losses will change, profits increase as shares move to the right and rise in price along the X-axis, which helps the bullish position.

  

  

Now let's take a look at a second view of the same position using the modern risk graph. The difference on this risk graph is the profit and loss moves in sympathy with the underlying instrument as we allow the Y axis to represent the movement of shares just like with a daily stock chart and the X-Axis for the associated P&L. Hey, what a concept!

  

  

In the end and regardless of whether option traders choose the classic or modern risk graph as their preferred view, the P&L's at any given time are unequivocally one in the same. But in a market, which doesn't always seem to make perfect sense, this modern, but age-old view of risk does seem to simplify matters and as we hope you'll agree.

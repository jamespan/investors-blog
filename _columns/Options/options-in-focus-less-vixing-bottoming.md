Bulls are finally closing in on investor sentiment, which has the earmarks of a potential bottom following a correction of more than six weeks and approaching 8% in the S&P 500. 

  

Tuesday night we correctly warned of the CBOE Volatility index or VIX failing to confirm a bottom for the broader market's fourth rally attempt. Prices in the VIX around the 18% to 19% level remained range bound and too close to the 10-day simple moving average as to get excited that selling in the market had finally capitulated. 

  

Amidst Wednesday's barrage of disappointing economic and fiscal sound bites, the VIX has finally risen to that sort of occasion. Intraday and entering the second half, with the S&P 500 off 1.8% and narrowly taking out its latest and now failed rally attempt, the VIX is up 13.7% at 20.85%. 

  

As such, premiums are displaying some signs of fearful investor behavior as prices break above 200-day simple moving average resistance and two or so months of congestion near 20%. Additionally, the VIX is nearing a "stretch" or differential of 11% relative to its 10-day simple moving average. 

  

As discussed prior, that's important as the market's most notorious gauge of both fear and complacency, is also a mean-reverting instrument. This means we can determine relative anxiety or over-confidence in the VIX if the stretch is strong enough; even if prices aren't at historically significant levels. The "stretch" we watch for is when the VIX moves in excess of 15% or more from the moving average as a sign that investors are potentially overreacting. In conjunction with a March bottom circa 2011 and 200-day simple moving average support in the S&P 500 less than 1% from current levels, a fifth possible rally attempt should prove to have much more going for it than its predecessors.

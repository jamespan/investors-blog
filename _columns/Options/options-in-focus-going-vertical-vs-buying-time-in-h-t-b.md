Much like stock traders, option strategists will tend to gravitate towards a certain style of trading that's done well for them over time. However, when a trader is considering a bullish vertical or bullish long call calendar and the underlying shares are potentially hard-to-borrow or on a threshold list, the decision of which is "better" goes beyond the basic risk graph and needs to be approached with a bit more care. 

  

Due to the possibility of assignment in a hard-to-borrow name and where the potential for being "called in" to cover shorted shares may exist, the vertical spread maintains a strategy edge versus the bull that chose a long call calendar and finds him or herself in the position of being assigned. 

  

With a bull call position the trader assigned on his or her short call can simply exercise the lower purchased strike call and cash out for maximum profitability earlier than otherwise possible. Maximum profitability will be determined by the distance between the purchased lower strike call and higher strike, call which was sold minus the initial debit needed to enter into the vertical.

  

On the other hand and under the same circumstances, a strategy such as the bullish OTM call calendar could be at risk of losing money but most certainly won't maximize its stated returns, if the trader were forced to cover his or her assigned shares. For instance, if the strategist were to exercise the longer-dated call in order to cover the short stock assignment; they'd be losing the debit paid to enter into the time spread. 

  

A better option, pardon the pun, might be for the trader to go purchase shares in the open market. However, there is risk here as they'd be left holding the long call. At that point, the trader would likely be facing some type of loss on the shares covered. Looking at the long back-month call still held, while it should also be up in value and offset the loss suffered on stock, it could always drop in price, if shares subsequently took a turn lower before and if the trader decided to cover.

  

Packaging an order to buy back the shares and sell the later-dated long call might be possible in order to remove any unwanted delta risk. However, that approach as well isn't going to find the trader's net P & L results anywhere near maximizing the gains associated with the calendar's initial risk-to-reward profile. The reason is this packaged order is the equivalent of a buy-write that's looking to close out the position after you've been forced / assigned into a synthetic long put from likely lower levels. 

  

Due to this somewhat hidden risk of assignment, the reality is the maximum gains of the calendar could be viewed as overstated when the trader was initially comparing the position to the vertical. The fact is the math of the risk graph doesn't take into account the risk associated with a hard-to-borrow situation. In fact, it's likely the bullish calendar may have been chosen versus the vertical due to an attractive but deceptive skew that may have set up between months. Maybe traders will get away with one or two of these "attractive" calendars, but that's only going to reinforce the idea of no added or untold risk underneath the surface. In the end, that could prove to be a costly error in judgment.

  

For their part, brokerages do their best to alert and give customers advance notice of problems shorting stock. However, under extreme conditions the broker may have discretion as to how they handle the short stock, which needs to be covered. If traders are unaware as their broker's practices regarding hard-to-borrow situations and "buy-ins", I'd strongly suggest getting very familiar with that protocol before making a flawed and potentially costly mistake.

**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) experienced a [nice breakout on Friday](https://www.investors.com/news/dow-jones-giant-unitedhealth-5-stocks-breaking-out-or-setting-up/) on strong earnings numbers. UNH stock is also currently trading above the 50- and 200-day moving averages. This highlights the stock's strength lately amid the bear market.




**UNH Stock: Trading A Bull Call Spread**
-----------------------------------------


UnitedHealth, which returned to [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as a half-size position, is indeed showing improving relative strength as seen by its relative strength line. The RS line has climbed into new highs, meaning UNH stock is sharply outperforming the S&P 500. So, let's look at a bullish option strategy for this Dow stock: the bull call spread. 


One way to gain exposure to a stock without risking too much is via a bull call spread, rather than buying the stock outright. This can be a good way to protect precious capital in this volatile market.


Let's assume a trader has a price target of 550 from now to mid-December. 



A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade. But this trade also limits the upside.


Going out to the December expiration, a 540-strike call option in UNH stock traded around $32.60 on Friday, and the 550 call was around $29.15. Buying the 540 call and selling the 550 call would create a bull call spread. The trade would cost $345 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100), and the maximum potential profit would be $655 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy, so if UNH stock closes below 540 on Dec. 16, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $345 premium paid.


**Maximum Profit Limit**
------------------------


Potential gains get capped above 550. So, no matter how high UNH stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $655.


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 500, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

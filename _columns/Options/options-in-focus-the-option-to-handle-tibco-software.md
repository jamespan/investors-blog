The last we spoke of **TIBCO Software** ([TIBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TIBX)) a couple Monday's ago back on November 14, the software / cloud play outfit was "handling" its chart well. On no news and as the S&P 500 grappled with 200-day simple moving average resistance, TIBX was breaking out of a handle consolidation within a deep but well-shaped cut base on heavy and above average volume. 

  

The inspirational muscle failed to stick and ultimately saw the pattern breakout fail as shares dropped more than 7% to 8% below the buy point. The good news is the price action could be chalked up to sympathy weakness tied to the broader market's ensuing correction than anything company specific. 

  

Lo' and behold and with the market bouncing back strongly last week and once more toiling with its long-term and typically red, moving average price ribbon, bulls are trying to re-wrap TIBX's existing base with a second handle which found support off its crossing 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. 

  

The other good news this time around is for option traders, TIBX appears to have made some mild progress as well regarding its option liquidity. Concerns of "just okay and slightly meager" have improved a bit as near-the-money markets in the $0.10 to $0.15 range now show some g bid / asks of $0.05 and the overall but narrow edge going out to calls and puts quoted in the $0.10 realm.

  

Shares of TIBX are up about 4% intraday and demonstrating relative strength attributed to a M&A sympathy reaction as cloud play constituent **SuccessFactor** ([SFSF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SFSF)) is being acquired by **SAP** ([SAP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SAP)) for $3.4 billion and a premium of about 50% over Friday's close. 

  

Scanning the option board, there's no overt fast money, heat-seeking action to speak of, but maybe that's a good thing? In the end or at in the here and now of Monday, outrights and two-legged plays such as calendars, verticals or diagonals are approachable strategies without having to forfeit too much edge to position, in entering and then possibly on exiting as well. Though, if the gift of a takeover was to emerge during the life of the position, we'd personally be more than happy to give back a little something in this season of giving.

Let's face it; we want the best of both worlds. We want upside potential on our stocks and no downside risk. The hard part is finding a strategy that targets this combination. Fortunately, options give us more than one alternative.  
   
The traditional strategy for limiting downside risk is buying protective puts. A protective put is a put that is purchased for the purpose of limiting the risk on owned shares. Similar to insurance, a put option gives its owner the right to sell stock at the strike price until the expiration date. Protective puts, therefore, limit the risk of owning stock. But there is a tradeoff in that puts cost money. If you have ever refrained from buying a protective put because it was "too expensive," then consider the advantages — and the challenges — of purchasing a protective put spread for protection.  
   
When you own stock, a protective put spread is a two-part option strategy consisting of one purchased put and one sold put. The sold put has the same expiration date but a lower strike price.  
   
Selling a put with a lower strike price has the advantage of bringing in premium that reduces the cost of the purchased put. However, the short put also limits the insurance value of the purchased put.  
   
As an example, assume that you own 500 shares of ARM Holdings (ARMH), a Leaderboard stock that on Monday was trading at 47.06, which is about 2% below a buy point. Also assume that you believe this stock is poised to move higher when the budget and debt limit negotiations are resolved. Further assume, however, that you are worried about a possible 10% decline in the stock over the short term if the negotiations carry on beyond October 17.  
   
Therefore, to protect against 10% downside risk, assume you buy five November 47-strike puts for 2.50 each and simultaneously sell five November 43-strike Puts for 1.10 each. The total cost of this put spread protection is 1.40 per spread, which is 56% of the cost of buying just the 47-strike put.  
   
If you do this, your total position will look like this:  
   
Long 500 ARMH @ 47.06 per share  
Long 5 Nov 47 Puts @ 2.50 per contract  
Short 5 Nov 43 Puts @ 1.1 per contract  
   
Graph 1 shows how the protective put spread strategy will perform on a per-share basis if it is held to expiration in November. For the sake of simplicity, commissions and taxes are not included.

  

The conclusion is that the purchased put spread reduces the risk of stock ownership over a limited price range in the underlying stock. In this example, Graph 1 shows that, from $47 to $43, the risk of owning ARMH stock is limited to $1.40 per share, not including commissions. Although the put spread costs less than purchasing the 47 Put alone, the disadvantage is that, below the lower strike price of 43 in this example, the risk is the same as an unprotected long stock position.  
   
If you are bullish on a stock for the "long term," but want lower-cost, limited protection for the "short term," buying a protective put spread might give you the cost versus protection tradeoff you want.

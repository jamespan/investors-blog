So how is it with fear expressing itself quite authoritatively in the likes of the S&P 500's daily chart, the CBOE Volatility Index can finish down just slightly? Similarly, how is it possible at a level of 17.83%, the market's most notorious fear and sometimes complacency gauge, can sit comfortably within its two-month lateral trading range near nominally cheap historical levels? I'm glad you asked. 

  

Bottom-line, sentiment is a tricky animal. But with a weekend to enjoy the sunshine rather than getting burned by the glare of a computer screen, it's slightly easier to see how traders collectively might believe the weekend will pass without any major market drivers negatively impacting prices. 

  

As much, traders using this logic will effectively discount option prices by removing time decay or the stuff embedded in calls and puts which comprise those fearful spikes like the one we saw early this morning. There is of course, three days of time decay to take advantage of!! Actually, we don't know that for a fact. However, if you're baffled as to why implieds don't move strongly higher when the market is tumbling strongly; that's pretty much the reason.

  

Did I say "Fearful spike?" Believe it or not, with Friday's early test of 20% in the VIX, the index pushed just more than 15% above its short-term 10SMA. Differentials of 15% or more are considered by many traders like me to represent opportunities for the index to revert back towards its mean. In a session like today's where the VIX is above the moving average, the "stretch" as I like to call it, is synonymous with fear in the market, albeit relative to recent movements and not necessarily those larger daily chart extremes that are easier to recognize.

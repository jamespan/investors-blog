**Union Pacific** ([UNP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNP)) recently made a list of [five stocks set to take off if the market rallies](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-five-stocks-set-to-take-off-if-market-rallies-upstart-skryrockets-roblox-dives/). Plus, UNP stock ranks No. 1 in its industry group, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).




The megacap transport play, with a $159 billion market value, owns a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 91, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 85 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 87.


The stock is also sitting above a rising [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), as well as the 50, and 200-day simple moving averages.


Let's assume a trader has a price target of 260 between now and mid-March. One way to take advantage of that opinion using options is to trade a bull call spread. A bull call spread is a defined risk trade, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


Create a bull call spread by buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Union Pacific Stock: Setting Up The Bull Call Spread
----------------------------------------------------



Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade, but it also limits the upside.


Going out to the March 18 expiration, a 255-strike monthly call option was trading around $3.85 on Tuesday, and the 260 call was around $2.20.


Buying the 255 call and selling the 260 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $165 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100), and the maximum potential profit would be $335 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if UNP closes below 255 on March 18, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $165 premium paid.


Potential gains get capped above 260. So no matter how high Union Pacific stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $335.


When To Cut Losses
------------------


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 240, I would consider closing early for a loss.


UNP has already reported Q4 earnings, so there should be no earnings risk with this trade.


More aggressive traders may prefer just to buy the 255-strike call in Union Pacific stock. A long call trade has unlimited upside potential.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

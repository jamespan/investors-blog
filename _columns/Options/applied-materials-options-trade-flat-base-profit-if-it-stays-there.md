**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) is hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average line and could be a good candidate for a bearish option trade. Here's how to set up a bear call spread on Applied Materials stock.




How To Set Up A Bear Call Spread
--------------------------------


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways or even slightly higher. As long as it stays below the short call at expiry, you make full profit.


Using a May 17 expiration, we can sell the 215 call and buy the 220 call on Applied Materials. That ends up being a net credit to the tune of 1.10 per contract. Since each contract is for 100 shares, that puts $110 into the trader's pocket and is also the maximum profit.


The short call at 215 gives us an important line in the sand. That's at about the top of this latest [flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-a-flat-base-skechers-stock-skx/). We want Applied Materials to stay below that line for this trade. If the stock continues to base or falls further below its 50-day line before the May 17 expiration, the trade achieves maximum profit.



Profits And Losses For Option Trade On Applied Materials Stock
--------------------------------------------------------------


The $110 premium received is also the maximum profit potential. The maximum loss takes the distance between the strikes and subtracts the premium received. So the maximum loss ends up at $390. That's roughly a 28% return on risk in just over two weeks.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy, and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


A stop loss could be set if AMAT trades above 215, or if the spread value rises from 1.10 to 2.20.


As this is a bearish position, traders who think Applied Materials could break out from its flat base over the next couple of weeks should not enter this trade. The position starts with a delta of -7, meaning it is roughly equivalent to being short 7 shares of AMAT stock.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Applied Materials is ranked No. 5 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 87 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Applied Materials is due to report earnings after the close on May 16, so this trade has earnings risk if held to expiration.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

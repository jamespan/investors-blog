Options on Brazil’s biggest exchange-traded fund in New York show that investors are betting on calmer days ahead for the country’s stocks.


A measure of volatility for the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ([EWZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EWZ)) exchange traded fund reached its highest level since the end of 2014 vs. one tracking the U.S. stock market. But traders see the turmoil as temporary, betting that volatility will drop by 9% in the next three months amid speculation that a change of government can pave the way for improvement.


The iShares fund, which tracks the MSCI Brazil 25/50 index, is up about 30% so far this year. The 25/50 index measures large-cap and midcap segments of Brazil's stock market. Meanwhile, the Ibovespa index is up about 18% year to date.


The Ibovespa fell modestly in afternoon trade Tuesday. Lender **Itau Unibanco Holding SA** ([ITUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ITUB)) lost 2% as discouraging corporate earnings highlighted weakness in the Brazilian economy.


However, **Gol Intelligent Airlines** ([GOL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOL)) jumped 13% in volume, 140% above average. Early this month, President Dilma Rousseff signed a measure allowing foreign companies to own as much as 49% of a Brazilian airline, up from 20% now.


A gauge of financial companies was the worst performer Tuesday among 10 industry groups. Profit has trailed analysts’ estimates by an average 38% for Brazilian companies that have reported fourth-quarter results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.


Brazil is in the midst of its worst recession in a century, sapping corporate profits at the same time that many of its biggest companies are getting hit by a slump in prices for the raw materials they produce. While the Ibovespa is the world’s best performing equity gauge this year, that’s mostly due to speculation that President Dilma Rousseff is close to being removed from office. Some investors and analysts say the country needs new leadership to repair the economy and reverse a widening budget gap.


"The outlook for Brazilian companies in general and profit is negative," said Pedro Paulo Silveira, the chief economist at the brokerage Nova Futura in Sao Paulo. “We just don’t see the country growing again in the next quarters."


State-owned oil producer **Petroleo Brasileiro** ([PBR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PBR)), which is at the center of Brazil’s biggest corruption scandal, reported Monday an unexpectedly huge net loss of 36.9 billion reals ($10.2 billion) for the final three months of 2015, a record amount.


Former executives of the oil producer, as well as the heads of the country’s biggest builders and some of its highest ranking politicians, have been arrested on charges that they participated in the scheme. The scandal has paralyzed Rousseff’s administration, preventing the government from getting support for a plan intended to revive the economy.

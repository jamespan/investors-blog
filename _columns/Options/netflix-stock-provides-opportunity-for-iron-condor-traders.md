**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) has tumbled recently, and option prices rose as implied volatility on Netflix stock reaches some of the highest levels for the last 12 months. 




High volatility means iron condors become more attractive with many stocks seeing the highest implied volatility (IV) readings in a year. 


Netflix stock is currently showing an IV Rank of 76% and an IV Percentile of 94%.


When volatility is high, the iron condor can be placed further out of the money, giving the trade a higher chance at success. 


Let's look at an example using NFLX stock. 


Iron Condor Using Netflix Stock
-------------------------------


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. 


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction. 


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Feb. 18 expiry, we could sell the 490 put and buy the 485 put. That spread could be sold on Friday for around $0.80. 


Then the bear call spread could be placed by selling the 600 call and buying the 605 call. This spread could be sold on Friday for around $0.75. 


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1.55 per contract, or $155 of premium. 


The profit zone ranges between 488.45 and 601.55. You can calculate this by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received. 


As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5-1.55 x 100 = $345. 



Therefore, if we take the premium ($155) divided by the maximum risk ($345), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 44.93%. 


Trade Works Best If Netflix Stock Stabilizes
--------------------------------------------


If price action stabilizes, then iron condors will work well.


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $155, so we could set a stop loss at 1.5 times the premium, or a loss of around $230. 


Another way to manage the trade is to set a point on the chart where the trade will be adjusted or closed. That could be around 510 on the downside and 580 on the upside. 


Netflix stock is ranked No. 1 in IBD's movies industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 68, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a woeful [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 35. 


The company will report earnings Jan. 20, so this trade would have earnings risk if held to expiry. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

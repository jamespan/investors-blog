Last week we [looked at bank earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/options/wells-fargo-stock-earnings-next-week-options-market-helps-set-expectations/) and a [JPMorgan Bull Put Spread based](https://www.investors.com/research/options/jpmorgan-stock-option-trade-earnings-report/) on the expected range. The JPMorgan idea worked well, with the put spread expiring worthless.




Earnings season [heats up this week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) with some crucial names reporting. 


As a reminder, to calculate the expected range, look up the option chain and add together the price of the at-the-money put option and the at-the-money call option. Use the first expiry date *after*the earnings date. 


While this approach is not as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate. 


Let's a look at some of this week's big names and the expected range according to the options market:

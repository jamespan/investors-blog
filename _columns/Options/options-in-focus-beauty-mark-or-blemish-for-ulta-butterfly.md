On the heels of its all-around, better-than-expected results and upwardly-revised outlook, shares of **Ulta Salon Cosmetics**  ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) are trading higher by about 8.5% with less than an hour left in the session. Technically, Friday's bid puts ULTA shares within striking distance of a breakout to fresh and glamorous all-time-highs from a somewhat irregular-looking base that we're willing to let the other guy deliberate over. 

  

One thing not up for deliberation is ULTA's option action. Trading is concentrated in the surrounding money December 70, 75 and 80 calls as shares trade near 74.35. Volume of 600'ish, 1200 and another 600'ish total for those respective strikes has the appearance of a potentially handsome long butterfly position being traded collectively by the crowd. 

  

  

Ultimately, ULTA's option liquidity / spread width makes the butterfly an unlikely vehicle for trading if one wishes to enter this type position for fair value, i.e. mid-market price, which is currently pricing the spread for $1.50 per contract. Due to that blemish, we consider it unlikely the fly is responsible for Friday's spied volume. We could always look to dig through the prints for confirmation of that fact, but experience tells us the odds on favorites are unrelated odd lot, outrights and maybe verticals as coincidentally responsible for the beautifully lined up, but likely, rare fly position.

  

Illustrated above is a reduced ratio of 6 x (12) x 6 long butterflies priced for $1.50. We've removed the typical expiration risk line in an effort to place focus on how the position would shape up from today and into the final week of trade. Due to this important and not-to-be overlooked step, the trader is faced with a mid-market profit of $500 if shares remained in the vicinity of 75 versus the "cover of a magazine" glamorous profit of $2,100 in two weeks' time.

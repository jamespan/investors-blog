**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has been on an impressive run since the March lows. It rose from 212 to over 350 for a 65% return in three months. It might be time for a pause in Apple stock, and a bear call spread option trade would profit.




AAPL stock's price-to-earnings ratio is currently above 27, which is the highest level it's been in the last five years. While IBD doesn't shy away from high-P/E stocks, many people do.


Option traders who think Apple stock might need a pause here could set up a bear call spread.


Option Trade: Bear Call Setup For Apple Stock
---------------------------------------------


A bear call spread is a bearish option strategy that will profit if the stock falls, stays flat and sometimes even if the stock rises slightly. The setup involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call. This is one part of the [iron condor strategy mentioned for Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/little-movement-apple-stock-could-make-iron-condor-option-trade-profit/) in a previous column.


Profits depend on the stock staying below the short call at expiration.


For Apple stock, a bear call spread could use the 380 strike as the short call and the 390 strike as the long call.


As of Friday, this trade offered a 13% return over the next month using the July 17 expiration.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $115 per contract with a maximum risk of $885.


The spread would achieve maximum profit if AAPL stock closes below 380 on July 17. In that case, the entire spread expires worthless and the premium seller keeps the $115 option premium.


Defined Risk For Option Trade
-----------------------------



Before entering any trade, it's important to know the risks. The maximum loss occurs if Apple stock closes above 390 on July 17. In that scenario, the premium seller loses $885 on the trade.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a defined-risk strategy. That means you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


In this case, AAPL stock could go to 1,000 or higher in the next month (unlikely) and, still, the most this trade would lose is $885.


The break-even point for the bear call spread is 381.15. You calculate it using the 380 short call plus the 1.15 option premium per contract. Keep in mind that due to the bid-ask spread, you may not get filled at these prices.


For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss of 20% of capital at risk. That's around $180 for the option trade.


Apple stock is above all the key moving averages and they are all rising. So is the stock market in general. This option trade is going against the trend, which can be risky.


It's important to understand the risks with options and know that investors can lose 100% of their investment.

The S&P 500 is clinging to gains in expiration trade this third Friday of March and one in which more than a few bulls witnessed an early expiration during this week's turmoil.

  

Despite the devastating price action, one bull discussed in this column Wednesday afternoon which had the opportunity to hold its head high with a quick double play was the option trader deploying the long call condor in the S&P500. 

  

Our illustrated six lot using March +128/-129/-130/+131 call construction priced for $0.31 per spread reached $0.61 to $0.62 out-the-gate inÂ what quickly turned out to be the highs of the session at 128.88 for bulls of all persuasions.

  

The double at $0.62 or profit of $0.31 per spread compares to the spread's intrinsic worth of $0.88 and an added $0.26 in the bottom-line at the end of the session had shares of SPY simply stayed the course at those levels. A rally of another $0.12 to perhaps as much as another $1.12 in the underlying would have resulted in the long call condor maximizing its gains with a profit of $0.69 and what amounts to as a perfect world for this fast money bull. 

  

Of course, the world is far from perfect these days and in fact, feeling quite volatile and angry on all sorts of fronts. Along those same lines, it's fully realized the double would have been impossible to catch if one's partial or full order to close the spread wasn't placed prior to the opening bell. However, clinging to hope those gains are sure to come if we're just a bit more patient but faced with the intraday reality of $0.62 turning into something less than our initial purchase price just doesn't make good "sense or cents" regardless of what time frame you operate on.

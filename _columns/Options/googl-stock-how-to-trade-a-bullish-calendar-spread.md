**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), the parent company of Google, has shown impressive strength in recent days and is breaking out to a new high. But with GOOGL stock trading at a high price that might make an option play too expensive for some option traders. Enter the calendar spread to get bullish exposure at a cheaper price.




Calendar Spread Setup For GOOGL Stock
-------------------------------------


During the recent rally, Alphabet stock has been holding above the rising [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


GOOGL stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97, an EPS Rating of 89 and an RS Rating of 77. It's also earned a place on [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader).


The calendar spread is a cheaper way to gain some upside exposure to GOOGL stock using options.


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Vega, one of the option measurements known as the "Greeks," refers to movement of the option price due to implied volatility. With implied volatility on GOOGL stock currently near a 12-month low, it might be a good time for a positive vega trade like a calendar spread.


With GOOGL stock trading around 1825, a bullish calendar spread might be placed at 1900.


Selling the Jan. 15-expiring 1900 call option will generate around $4,155 in premium and buying the Feb. 19 1900 call will cost around $7,190.


Risks And Rewards
-----------------


The two legs of the calendar spread on GOOGL stock results in a net cost for the trade of $3,035 per spread. That is the most the trade can lose.


While that might still be prohibitively expensive for some traders, it's cheaper than simply buying the long call option. You offset some of the cost by collecting premium.


The estimated maximum profit is around $4,000 but will vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


If GOOGL stock trades up to around 1900, the calendar spread should increase resulting in a net profit.



The break-even prices for the trade are around 1800 and 2010.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 15% in terms of the option premium spread and a profit target of 20%.


Position size should be no more than 3% of total portfolio value.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

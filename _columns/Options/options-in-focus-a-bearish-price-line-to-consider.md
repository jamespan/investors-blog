Since busting out of a nice, tight flat base of about two months in length earlier this month, shares of IBD 50 component **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) have buckled but not completely collapsed back below its proper breakout point of 428.20. Over the past week shares have been caught wedged in a small consolidation between that key level and 50-day simple moving average support. 

  

Could this be the start of a forced technical grounding i.e. correction for some high-flying bulls that have taken shares on a nice 142% trip into the clouds from its last corrective move back during the summer of 2010? 

  

With more than a few growth stocks growing increasingly suspect on a technical basis, i.e. **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)), **Salesforce.com** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) and **Riverbed Technology** ([RVBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVBD)) to name a few, booking passage as a bear doesn't sound entirely unreasonable to this trader. In lieu of even the strongest growth stocks finding pullbacks or corrections of up to 30% a fact of life in a healthy market environment after putting together an extended rally; this seems all the more approachable. 

  

For those so willing to take on this type of contrarian position, Priceline's well-traded option market offers up a strong way to limit one's risk, just in case trend persistence decides to make another appearance despite our less enthusiastic technical stance on shares. 

  

With earnings slated for February 17 and immediately in front of the Feb cycle's expiration, premiums are already finding a bid, which makes outright purchases on the likes of a long put position, prohibitive. As much and for likeminded bears, using a bear put vertical as a starter position looks like a smart idea. 

  

Does that sound familiar? For regular readers of this column, less than a month ago when we were feeling a bit more optimistic, we took a bull call spread and eventually converted it into a profitable all call long condor during the development and breakout of the same described flat base that's now a bit more troubling by design. 

  

Without making a "rec or wreck" of other trader's portfolios, taking into consideration the possibility for a 15% correction or half of what might be seen as the normal course of doing business, I like the February 390 / 375 or 395 / 375 bear put spreads. Both positions cut down potential theta risk by 50% to 60% thereabouts and stand to do quite well in the event shares do correct courtesy of an earnings catalyst. 

  

And if the trader is lucky and the stock begins the process of correcting prior to the announcement, both spreads should be in strong position for a pre-event adjustment so that holding through earnings is much closer to being a sure thing, which it never really is. *What do you think?

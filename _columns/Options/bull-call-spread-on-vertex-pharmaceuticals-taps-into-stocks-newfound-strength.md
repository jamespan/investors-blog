**Vertex Pharmaceuticals** ([VRTX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VRTX)) was added to the [IBD SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader) portfolio on Friday after finding support at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). VRTX stock is currently No. 1 in IBD's biotech industry group.




The company last week [announced earnings of $3.60 per share](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vrtx-stock-vertex-earnings-q2-2022/), which beat expectations of $3.47 and was well above the 17 cents a share from a year earlier.


Vertex Pharmaceuticals is showing is showing green check marks across the board, and today we will look at a bullish option strategy called a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to October expiration, a 300-strike call option was trading around $10.75 on Friday. The 310 call was around $7.70.


Trade Offers $695 Return on VRTX Stock
--------------------------------------


Buying the 300 call and selling the 310 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $305 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). The maximum potential profit would be $695 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).



A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if VRTX stock closes below 300 on Oct. 21, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $305 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 310, so no matter how high VRTX stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $695.


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 272, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), VRTX stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

With an hour left in Friday's session, the market is well on its way to establishing an attempted rally day. For the bulls yearning for better days ahead, leadership can be found in the broad-based S&P 500, which is currently up 0.90%. That same price action has reclaimed the 50-day simple moving average and established what could become a lower low pivot within a high-level double bottom pattern. 

  

On the other hand and not to be dismissed, volume is running lighter, a lower high and lower low is in place, the market is still under correction and three or more days removed from displaying stronger underlying conviction via a possible follow-through day and, and, and... 

  

So, what's an option trader to do? Well, if you're to actually look at the **S&P 500**'s ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) listed ETF, there are an incredible amount of choices to consider if you're a bull, bear or somewhere in-between like a more neutral-minded option hedge hog. 

  

The S&P 500 has weekly, quarterly, regular monthlies and of course long-term listed calls and puts known as LEAPs. Coupled with one-point strike distances and very strong liquidity characteristics. The options, pardon the pun, are nearly limitless. 

  

  

One strategy, which may have proved popular based on a quick perusal of today's option action and appreciating prior support and resistance levels is the April 130 / 125 put ratio spread. 

  

With volume of around 50K in the 130s and nearly 84K in the lower strike put, a ratio approaching 2-to-1 has traded. In conjunction with premiums lining up near $0.00 to establish a spread and the 1200 level being the next and previously well-played nominal marker of interest and the lower expiration breakeven pointâ€”the spread makes a lot of sense as possibly a popular one.

  

Shown above, we're looking at the front-spread position in which a trader is purchasing +5 April 130 puts and selling -10 April 125 puts for basically even money. The question of whether this trader will make "cents" of this spread versus the other back-spreading side of the position is still to be determined. Personally though, I'm optimistic enough to like a controlled correction and giving this softer delta bear the benefit of the doubt for now.

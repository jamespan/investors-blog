**Deere** ([DE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DE)) continues outperform as the farm economy booms and analysts expect the company's earnings to jump 112% to $4.47 per share.




Deere stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 91 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92.


The company is also part of the IBD 50 and the SwingTrader portfolio.


Let's take a look at a bullish option trade on Deere stock known as a bull put spread.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Bullish Deere Stock Option Trade
--------------------------------


With the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) around 380, a bull put spread could be placed with the short put at 380 and the long put at 375.



Using the May 21 expiration, this spread was trading for around $1.35. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $135 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $365.


That represents a 37% return on risk between now and May 21 as long as Deere stock remains above 380.


If DE stock closes below 375 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $365.


With earnings set for May 21, the same date as the expiration of these options, there would be no chance to adjust or close if the stock drops after the market close on May 21.


Break-even Point For Bull Put Spread
------------------------------------


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 378.65, which is calculated as 380, less the 1.35 option premium per contract.


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 7, which means it is a similar exposure to owning seven shares of Deere stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

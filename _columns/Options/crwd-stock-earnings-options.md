**CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is showing extremely high implied volatility in the lead-up to the earnings announcement next Tuesday.




There is also significant volatility skew: Short-term options show much higher implied volatility than long-term options.


One way to take advantage of this skew is via a diagonal put spread.


This option strategy is an advanced strategy because it utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.


Let's look at an example:


Traders could sell a March 8 put with a strike price of 270 and buy a March 22 put with a strike price of 265. *(An earlier version of this story incorrectly said a 370 put.)*


Maximum Risk On Upside $50
--------------------------


As of Wednesday's close, the March 8 put could be sold for around $3.40 and the March 22 put could be bought for $3.90.



The net cost of the trade would be $50. That's also the maximum risk on the upside.


The risk on the trade is on the downside, with a potential maximum loss of $550. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread (5) multiplied by 100 and adding in the cost of the trade (50).


The maximum potential gain is around $1,200. That would occur if CrowdStrike closes right at 270 on March 8.


The trade has a large profit zone in between 250 and 340.


Trade Works Well If CrowdStrike Stays In Range
----------------------------------------------


If CRWD stock stays between these values, the trade should do well. The main risk is if the stock drops below 250.


The initial trade set up has a delta of -1. That means the position is roughly neutral to start with. Note that this delta number can change significantly as the stock starts to move.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), CRWD stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

With under an hour in Thursday's session and admiring **Intel**'s ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) subjectively good-looking, low-volume breakout today and its attached option action, I couldn't help but come up with a riddle of sorts. Which is better, potentially losing $0.24 per contract in eight calendar days or $0.21 over 21 days? The riddle is actually a common reality and one facing some Intel traders this very moment. 

  

With shares trading at 21.98, the at-the-money Weekly February 22 call is priced for $0.24 with expiration next Friday. At the same time, a trader could venture out to the March 22 call with 29 days until expiration and find that contract trading for $0.45. That said and all else being equal, in 21 days we could expect the call to be trading for $0.24 and having lost $0.21 or 47% of its value composed entirely of time premium. 

  

The mathematical reason for this pricing phenomenon is time decay isn't linear but is actually a function of the square root of time. In using pricing formulas to derive option values, there's nothing that can be done about that. But, which is betterâ€”potentially losing 100% of $0.24 or 47% and $0.21 over 8 or 21 days respectively? 

  

Looking at things through a vacuum, which isn't recommended, the latter March contract certainly seems to have more going for it based on time and a smaller loss. However, variables such as the actual dollar commitment per contract at stake and vega or volatility risk need to be examined as well before making a possible decision that might be considered a more informed one. 

  

Personally, volatility risk is not considered a large issue in this situation as we are looking at a 20'something stock with low-to-moderate 20'something implieds and less than 30 days to go until expiration. That said, I see the factors continuing to build in favor of the March contract versus the shorter-term weekly. However, there is still the dollar cost involved. 

  

The March call is priced at $0.45 compared to the weekly's $0.24 per contract. But that can be solved or equaled out by taking on the same percent risk of portfolio in each position. If we use 2% of a $20K portfolio that would amount to roughly 17 contracts for the weekly February 22 call and 9 calls purchased if a trader opted for the March. 

  

If one were to go that route, the inherent leverage of 17 contracts to the other's 9 means a speedy move higher in shares of INTC favors the near-term position. And therein lays at least one rub sometimes troubling investors using options; the dream of the faster and easier money. But on "wasting assets" like long calls and comparing different maturities, it would seem the real answer is the 2% solution deserves further consideration before seeing various positions as equivalents.

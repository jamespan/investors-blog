In an era of ultralow interest rates, the search for yield gets harder. Here's where options can help with a covered call strategy. We'll take a look at how to use shares of Microsoft stock to bring in some income.




Covered Call Strategy
---------------------


The current yield on the S&P 500 is hovering at an anemic 1.46%. That's hardly ideal for investors who rely on income.


So how can we find an appropriate yield in the current environment? Savvy investors can enhance their yield on stocks such as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) by using a covered call strategy.


Say you have 100 shares of MSFT stock. By selling a call option against those shares, you collect a premium.


Of course, as a seller of the call option, you have an obligation to provide your shares at the strike price if they are called away from you. That means your upside is limited. But you increase the yield from the investment in the form of an option premium.


The investor keeps the premium generated from selling calls no matter what happens with the stock.


When trading covered calls, most investors sell monthly calls against their stock to make the most of the effects of time decay.


That makes a lot of sense but also requires more active management.


What if we sold yearly covered calls against Microsoft stock?


Microsoft Stock Yearly Covered Calls
------------------------------------


On MSFT stock, a September 2023 call option with a 280 strike price sells for around $29.70. That brings in $2,970 in premium per 100-share contract.


Purchasing 100 shares of Microsoft stock will cost around $26,600, but the net cost can be reduced by the $2,970 option premium received.



Therefore, we have a potential return of 12.6% (2,970/23,630) in 381 days. That's 12% annualized.


That sure beats the dividend yield on most stocks in the current market and is certainly a whole lot better than the current MSFT stock yield of 0.9%.


Covered calls are a fantastic way to generate extra income from a stockholding. The premium also offers some downside protection because it reduces your cost basis.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Microsoft stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 71, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 91 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 47.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

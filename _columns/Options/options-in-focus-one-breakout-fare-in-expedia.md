**Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) is trading up about 4% in heavy volume as bulls come on board following a couple broker upgrades this morning for the online travel outfit. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage with a buy rating citing the company's turnaround and potential form margin growth, while Deutsche Bank raised shares to buy.

  

Technically speaking, Friday's strong action has shares breaking out to fresh all-time highs from well-constructed cup-shaped base, which found support off its prior highs. Intraday, shares have pulled back from highs of 60.29 and are trading $0.20 below its buy point of 50.60. So, what's a bull to do? Or more fittingly given this is a column featuring options, what's a bull looking to Expedia's call and / or put markets to consider? 

  

One idea for bulls given Expedia's mixed underlying volatility in relation to its premiums is the bull call or bull-put vertical. While both spreads maintain limited risk and reward structures, typically investors seeking continued upside at the expense of lower statistical odds will play the at or out-of-the-money bull call spread. And for those traders that simply see a stock, which shouldn't break below a certain level such as the 10-day or 50-day simple moving average, an out-of-the-money credit spread is generally the preferred mode of transport in the options. 

  

  

In this situation where the bull put spread is used, some portion of the credit is kept if shares don't fall so far as to break below the sold strike or the breakeven level at expiration. The sacrifice for this kind of higher probability play is the maximum payoff is smaller than the fore-described verticals using calls. Of course, this type of ticket or passage can also be bought using an in-the-money call spread. 

  

The graph above shows a 5x October 60 / 65 bull call spread. With shares at 59.40, the near-the-money vertical costs $1.50 per spread. In order to breakeven, shares will need to be above 61.50 at expiration or roughly 3.5% higher from current levels. Above 65 and this position would yield a max profit of $3.50 or a return of 233%. In the end and regardless of one's preference for seating with verticals; there are some decent options to consider in Expedia, which go way beyond flying coach with naked long stock.

Depending on how one counts, Tuesday marked either day one or day two of the broader markets fourth rally attempt since the early May highs. But lighter volume, oodles of resistance levels such as the 10-day simple moving average and April lows or the slightly higher up 1300 level in the S&P 500 are a couple reasons for bulls to still bide their time on the sidelines. Another factor may be the CBOE Volatility index or VIX. 

  

Despite the corrective move of more than 7.5% in the S&P 500 since early May, the VIX hasn't provided traders with confirmation the other guy still dabbling in the market, has been worried; let alone fearful of what's been a gloomy June. The VIX did hit 20% Monday to challenge its trading range highs, as well as its 200-day simple moving average. 

  

As we expect to see those prices in the VIX to spike during troubled times in the market, the action represented a step in the right direction. However, the market's most notorious sentiment gauge still fell well short of any panic by either a historic standard closer to 30% or relative to recent short-term price movements. 

  

This latter pulse taking that I commonly refer to as "the stretch" looks at the percentage difference in prices relative to the VIX's 10-day simple moving average. On Monday and with less-than-panicked highs of 20% in hand, the stretch or differential amounted to 10% compared to a minimum requirement of 15% or greater. 

  

With Tuesday finding the mean-reverting but far from mean or nasty VIX right back at its moving average, I'd be surprised if another round of mad money isn't around the corner. As is the case sometimes, one man's rally attempt is another's bear market rally and one, which seems fit to deserve the benefit of the doubt.

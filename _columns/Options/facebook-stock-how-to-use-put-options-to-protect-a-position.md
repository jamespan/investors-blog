Options are a fantastic and flexible tool that can be used for the following purposes:


1. Speculation
2. Leverage
3. Income
4. Risk Management




So far in this column we've looked at some [speculative trades](https://www.investors.com/research/options/virgin-galactic-stock-options-could-skyrocket-if-stock-rallies/), some [income trades](https://www.investors.com/research/options/verizon-stock-increase-yield-by-16-6-percent-with-covered-calls/) and some [leveraged trades](https://www.investors.com/research/options/netflix-stock-how-to-trade-options-how-synthetic-long-stock-trade-makes-money/). Today we're going to look at using options to protect a stock position.


A [put option](https://www.investors.com/research/options/options-trading-how-to-start-using-options-how-to-manage-risk/) is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain underlying asset at the [strike price](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) on or before expiry.


For this right, the buyer of the put option pays a [premium](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) to the option seller. Think of it like buying insurance against your house burning down.


You as the homeowner pay the insurance premium and the options seller is like the insurance company.


[Owning a put option](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) gives the owner the right to sell their stock at a certain price, no matter how low it goes. The downside is protected while the investor still gets to benefit in the upside.


Facebook Stock: How To Set Up A Protective Put
----------------------------------------------



**Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is one stock that has experienced a tremendous rally in recent months, rising from a 137.10 low on March 18 to about 230 recently.


Investors who have participated in that rally may want to lock in some profits. Recently, an Aug. 21-expiring 230 put cost around $1,550 per contract. The buyer of one contract in this put option would be able to sell 100 shares of their Facebook stock at 230 each on or before Aug. 21, no matter what happens to the stock.


The protection is quite costly at the moment because [implied volatility](https://www.investors.com/research/options/alphabet-stock-earnings-option-trading/) remains stubbornly high, so the protection costs 6.74% of the total position. Still, this could be a good idea if investors want to hold on to their shares but protect against a summer swoon.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wOPTIONS052820-237x300.jpg)The accompanying table compares the performance of 100 Facebook shares using a trade price of 230.16 with 100 shares plus a protective put.


As you can see, losses are limited on the downside and the cost of the protection means an underperformance on the upside.


When Will This Protective Put Option Erode In Value?
----------------------------------------------------


This assumes the put is held to expiry. With a protective trade like this, it's best not to hold until expiration because time decay will accelerate toward the expiration date. With that in mind, I would not hold the put when there are fewer than 30 days left before the expiration.


This is just one example of using put options as a risk management tool while still being able to benefit on the upside.

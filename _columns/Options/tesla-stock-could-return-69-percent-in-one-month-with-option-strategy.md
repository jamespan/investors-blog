Tesla stock jumped yesterday on the news that the stock will finally join the S&P 500 next month. That could set it up for a bull put spread option trade.




**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 99, an EPS Rating of 76 and an RS Rating of 98. The technical action was compelling enough to make Tesla stock [IBD's Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tesla-stock-joins-s-and-p-500-near-buy-point/) yesterday.


While shares did close off their highs of the day, the news launched Tesla stock back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) with an impressive 8.21% gain.


Yesterday, we looked at an [extremely short-term bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/nvidia-stock-evaluating-high-risk-high-reward-option-earnings-trade/) on **Nvdia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)). Today I thought we could look at a similar idea on TSLA stock, but with a different duration.


With the 50-day moving average around 420, option traders could look to place the bull put spread at just below that level.


Bullish Tesla Stock Option Trade
--------------------------------


Traders who think Tesla stock will not drop below the 50-day moving average could look to sell a Dec. 18 put with a 420 strike and buy a 415 put at the same expiration.



As of yesterday, this spread was trading for around $2.05, which means a trader selling this spread would receive $205 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $295 (the difference in strikes less the option premium received).


That represents a potential 69.49% return on risk in one month as long as TSLA stock remains above 420.


That's a slightly higher return potential than the NVDA bull put spread, but the tradeoff is it takes longer to achieve that return (assuming the trade works, of course).


If Tesla stock closes below 415 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $295.


Managing The Trade
------------------


With a trade like this, I would look to exit the trade early for a loss if Tesla stock broke back below the 50-day moving average.


Another good rule of thumb is to take profits if 50% of the return potential has been achieved in less than 50% of the time.


In other words, if the trade is showing a profit of around $100 before Dec. 3, you can take the profits early.

With option trading it's not enough to simply be a bull or bear. The Greeks embedded in all calls and puts force or should cause those would be directional strategists to also contemplate the impact of variables like time decay, implied and statistical volatility and even dividends and possibly interest rates, depending on one's time frame. 

  

There's also liquidity to consider when dealing with options. Less than desirable conditions require extra thought as to whether a spread or outright for that matter, is even worth entering into when prices theoretically look promising. I guess you could call those important points, "option nuances". 

  

So the next time you're looking at a successful cup-with-handle breakout like the one forced upon **Nuance Communications** ([NUAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUAN)) on "collaboration" buzz with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) that's also right in front of its earnings report...make an already speculative business a bit more bullet proof.

  

  

Ahead of tonight's report more than a few bulls seem to think that means buying calls based on fresh two-plus highs in premiums and lowly put/call of 0.10. Most active are the May 22 call on volume of about 800 contracts. As much, contrarians and theoretical types can cozy up to one another at the Bull & Bear tonight as the bulls having it all wrong. However, if I were to guess in front of the report; I think those optimistic but softer delta guys and gals and like our illustrated 8-lot above; will be buying the rounds later on.

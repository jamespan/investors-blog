Amazon stock hasn't done much since September. But with volatility jumping across the board as the market goes through this correction you don't need the price to change in order to make money on an option trade.


Stock traders only profit if stocks go up, but as option traders we can profit in up, down and sideways markets. The key is knowing which strategies to implement at which times.




Taking Advantage Of Volatility With An Iron Condor Option Trade
---------------------------------------------------------------


The implied volatility for **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) rose from 23% to 30% in the last few days. If price action stabilizes then iron condors can be a great trade.


As a reminder, an iron condor is simply a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay. That's combined with the expectation that the stock will not move too much in either direction.

To set up the option trade on Amazon stock, let's first take the bull put spread. Using the June 18 expiry, we could sell the 3000 put and buy the 2980 put. That spread went for around $5.20 yesterday.


Then the bear call spread could sell the 3300 call and buy the 3320 call. This spread traded around $6.25 yesterday.


In total the iron condor for AMZN stock generated around $11.45 in premium.


Profit And Risk Based On Amazon Stock Action
--------------------------------------------


The profit zone for this iron condor occurs if AMZN stock stays between 2988.55 and 3311.45. This calculation takes the short strikes and adds or subtracts the premium received (3000 minus 11.45 and 3300 plus 11.45).


The maximum risk on the iron condor can take the difference between the strikes and subtract the premium received. As both spreads are $20 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 20 – 11.45 x 100 = $855.


To calculate the potential return, take the premium received ($1145) divided by the maximum risk ($855). That's a potential return of 134% in just over a month for the iron condor on Amazon stock.


Managing The Iron Condor
------------------------


That's a very nice return and it would be great if things were as easy as that. However, iron condors generally need some management as the trade progresses and the stock starts to move in either direction.


That takes a bit of skill and experience, so this isn't a strategy for beginners, but it's a fantastic strategy once you get the hang of it.


For a trade like this, I would close, adjust or hedge the trade if AMZN stock broke below 3000 or above 3300.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

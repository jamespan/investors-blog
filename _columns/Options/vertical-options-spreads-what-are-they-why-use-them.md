This is the first of a series of articles on vertical options spreads. Vertical spreads are an intermediate-level options strategy with a wide variety of uses. Traders who use vertical spreads must first understand the strategy mechanics, i.e., what happens at expiration. Second, it is necessary to understand the nuances of the price behavior of vertical spreads prior to expiration, and, third, a two-step plan for trading a vertical spread is an important part of using vertical spreads successfully.

  

In addition to getting a stock's direction correct, option purchasers face two challenges: time erosion and changes in implied volatility. An option strategy known as a vertical spread reduces the impact of these market forces. There are, of course, some tradeoffs.

  

This article will first review the basics of vertical spreads. Second, the concepts of how these spreads might reduce the impact of time erosion and changing implied volatility will be discussed. Finally, an example using a stock recently features in IBD's [The Big Picture](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm) column will be presented.

  

**The Basics of Vertical Spreads**

  

A vertical spread is created by buying one option and, simultaneously, selling an equal quantity of another option of the same type, but with a different strike price.

  

One type of vertical spread is the "bull call spread," which is sometimes used by investors with a bullish opinion. As an example, assume that XYZ stock is trading at $49 per share. An XYZ "50-55 bull call spread" is created as follows (Note that commissions are not included. Also, vertical spreads must be carried in a margin account.):

  

Buy one XYZ 30-day 50 Call @ 3.50 or $350 debit  
Sell one XYZ 30-day 55 Call @ 1.25 or $125 credit  
Net 2.25 or $225 debit

  

**Profit Potential and Risk**

  

In the case of the bull call spread described above, the Risk And Return table nearby shows that the maximum risk is 2.25 and the maximum profit potential is to 2.75, or $275 per spread. The maximum risk of a bull call spread is the net cost paid including commissions, or $225 in this example. The maximum profit potential is calculated by subtracting the net cost of the spread, 2.25, from the difference between the strike prices, 5.00, which is the spread's maximum value. In this example, the maximum gain is achieved when the stock price reaches or rises above 55, and the maximum loss is realized when the price falls to 50 or below. The break-even point is equal to the lower strike price plus the net cost. In this example the break-even point at expiration is 50.00 + 2.25, or 52.25. The profit/(loss) calculations in the Risk And Return table are illustrated in the graph below. 

  

**Challenges Facing Options Traders**

  

Time erosion is the decrease in an option's time value. Time value is that portion of an option's total price in excess of intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the in-the-money portion of an option's total price. Since the life of an option is limited, the time value of an option decreases with each passing day as expiration approaches.

  

Implied volatility is the volatility percentage that explains the market price of an option. Implied volatility corresponds to the risk factor in insurance, and, as perceptions of a stock's risk change, the implied volatility changes. As a result, an option price can change even though neither the stock price nor the time to expiration changed noticeably. Decreasing implied volatility can also offset the anticipated increase in an option's price from a favorable stock price move.

  

Since vertical spreads consist of one long option and one short option, the combined position is less susceptible to the effects of time decay and the fluctuations in implied volatility relative to an outright long option position. Another benefit of a vertical spread is the reduced cost (risk): the premium received from the sold option can be used to offset the cost of the purchased option. The disadvantages of vertical spreads are that potential profits are limited and commissions may be greater.

  

**Reduced Impact of Time Erosion**

  

As time erosion reduces the price of the purchased (or long) call in a vertical spread, it is also reduces the price of the sold (or short) call. The net time erosion, therefore, is less than the erosion of the long call alone.

  

**Reduced Impact of Implied Volatility**

  

If implied volatility rises, then the prices of both the long and short calls in a vertical spread will rise. If implied volatility falls, the prices of both options will also fall. The net change in the spread's price, therefore, will be less than the change in price of just the long call.

  

**Other Vertical Spreads**

  

In addition to bull call spreads, there are bear call spreads. There are also bull and bear put spreads. There are also other types of spreads such as time spreads, ratio spreads and diagonal spreads. Not all spreads reduce the impact of time erosion and changes in implied volatility. Before using any spread, be sure you understand its advantages and disadvantages.

  

**Current Example — ARUN**

  

**Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) hit a 52-week high Friday on heavy volume after having rallied over $4.00 from the previous day. The company reported strong earnings before the open and was listed as a leader in up volume in [The Big Picture on Friday, February 22](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm). ARUN at 25.40 is comfortably above its 2-year highs and could be poised for a continued upward move. However, as Paul Whitfield stated in Monday's The Big Picture, "The uptrend remains under pressure, and a defensive posture is warranted."

  

If you believe that ARUN will trade sideways to up 10% while the uptrend is under pressure, and if you are willing to risk 1.80 in return for a potential profit of 2.20 per share, then the options market gives you an opportunity to buy a bull call spread expiring in April with a break-even point only slightly above the current stock price.

  

With ARUN trading at 25.40 at the close on Feb. 22, the ARUN April 24 Call was offered at 2.60 per share, and the April 28 Call had a bid price of 0.80. Simultaneously buying the 24 Call and selling the 28 Call at these prices creates an ARUN April 24-28 bull call spread for a net cost of 1.80 per share, not including commissions.

  

The maxim possible risk is 1.80 per share plus commissions, the cost of the spread. If the stock rallies to or above 28 at options expiration in April, then the bull call spread will reach its maximum value of 4.00 per share for a net profit of 2.20 per share, not including commissions, which is the maximum potential profit in this example. If the stock falls below 24.00 and the option position is held to expiration, then the maximum loss is realized. In practice, it is advisable to establish a risk limit before initiating such a trade and exit at that point if the stock price declines.

  

**Summary**

  

A bull call spread is created by purchasing a call with a lower strike price and selling another call with a higher strike price. The maximum risk is the net cost of the spread plus commissions, and the maximum profit is the difference between the strikes less the cost. In general, vertical spreads reduce the impact of two big challenges for options purchasers, time erosion and changing implied volatility.

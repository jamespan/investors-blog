This is the sixth in a series of articles on volatility. The goal of this series is to clarify the different meanings of the term volatility and to discuss its many possible uses, including describing stock price action, evaluating option prices, choosing option strategies, and forecasting the market. Option traders should strive to gain an accurate understanding of volatility — and its many uses — because volatility affects option prices, trading decisions and risk analysis.

  

As discussed in previous articles, implied volatility is the level of volatility that explains the market price of an option. Implied volatility is calculated by taking the five known inputs to the option pricing formula plus the market prices of a call and put, and solving for the level of volatility. Implied volatility makes an option's theoretical value equal to its market price. Also, as discussed in the last article, implied volatility changes, sometimes dramatically, around earnings reports.

  

This article discusses how traders can gain insight into how much implied volatility might change before and after earnings reports and how changing implied volatility can impact option prices and strategy selection. Since implied volatility tends to change the most before and after scheduled announcements — such as earnings reports — any information that helps to formulate realistic estimates of the results of strategies can be invaluable to traders.

  

**Changing Implied Volatility — An Example**

  

Exhibit 1 illustrates what happened immediately before and after the earnings announcement made by SalesForce.com (CRM) on February 28, 2013.

  

On Thursday, February 28, CRM stock closed at $169.20, and the March 170, 180 and 190 calls closed at 6.90, 3.00 and 1.15, respectively. On the very next day — after CRM announced earnings of 53 cents per share versus an expected loss of 3 cents per share — the stock price rose 12.80 to 182.00. The March 170 call rose 87% to 12.90 and the March 180 Call rose 66% to 5.00, but the March 190 Call fell 4% to 1.10.

  

Newcomers to options might wonder, "How this can be? How could the March 180 Call rise only 2.00 with the stock price rising 12.80? And how could the 190 Call fall in price?"

  

Exhibit 1 illustrates that stock price is not the only factor affecting option prices. Days to expiration (or time) and implied volatility are also factors. While the impact of the loss of only one day is probably minimal, the 26 percentage point drop in implied volatility is significant.

  

On Thursday, before the announcement, the level of implied volatility was 54%. On Friday after the announcement, however, the level of implied volatility had dropped to 26%. A newcomer to options might reasonably ask, "How much of an impact did the drop in implied volatility have?" Exhibit 2 answers this question by estimating the options prices if implied volatility had remained constant.

  

Exhibit 2 estimates that, if implied volatility has remain constant at 51%, then the March 190 Call would have increased from 1.15 to 3.95 for a 243% increase in price and the largest percentage increase of the three calls analyzed. Furthermore, this increase would have made the March 190 Call the most profitable of the three. In reality, however, as shown in Exhibit 1, the March 190 Call actually lost money and was the worst performing of the three calls analyzed.

  

**What Happened?**

  

A trader that is new options might reasonably ask, "What is going on here? Why did implied volatility drop so much?" The answer to these questions lies in the expectations in the options market as evidenced by the levels of implied volatility.

  

On Thursday, before the announcement, the market was looking forward and preparing for a "big" stock price change after the earnings announcement. And this is reflected in the high level of implied volatility of 51%. On Friday, the market was still looking forward, but the stock price move from the earnings announcement was in the past. With the new and lower level of implied volatility of 26%, the market no longer had expectations for a stock price change similar to the change of the day before (after the earnings announcement).

  

**How Might This Be Predicted?**

  

If you have never traded options on SalesForce.com, then you might know that 51% is a "high" level of implied volatility. And you might also not know how much the level might drop after an earnings announcement. Fortunately, the Chicago Board Options Exchange in conjunction with i-Volatility.com offers a free tool for tracking levels of implied volatility.com.

  

Exhibit 3 shows the one-year composite chart of both historical volatility (lower line) and implied volatility. These lines are an average of volatility levels across strike prices and expiration dates. The numbers on the chart, therefore, will not match any specific option, but they give a good indication of whether the current levels of volatility are "high," "low," or "average" and for estimating how much volatility levels might change after important announcements.

  

The arrows indicate when earnings announcements were made; and the sharp drops in the upper line indicate how much composite implied volatility fell after the announcements. For example, the right-most arrow shows that the composite level of implied volatility fell from approximately 42% to approximately 27%. While this change is less than the actual change experienced by the March options in the example discussed above, seeing that 42% is "high" for the composite level is a good clue that 51% is "very high" for a specific option.

  

**Summary**

  

Implied volatility can change dramatically before and immediately after earnings announcements. And these changes can significantly impact the desirability of buying specific options. Options traders, therefore, must gather information about changing volatility levels and use that information to make realistic forecasts for future events.

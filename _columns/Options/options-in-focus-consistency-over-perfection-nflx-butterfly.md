Two sessions ago we discussed and compared a short-term weekly March 205 / 210 / 215 long butterfly favored by this strategist relative to the fast money's more optimistic bet in the 210 call, which appeared to be a popular one based on heavy buy side activity. With less than an hour to go Friday, it turns out we were very much right in our two-lot, $1.10 per spread wager versus a compared three-lot long call strategy. 

  

At current prices and shares of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) just pennies from the coveted middle 210 strike, our spread is worth nearly $4.55 for a profit of $3.45 per spread. On the other hand, the long call is trading for about $0.30 per contract compared to a purchase price of $0.87.

  

As much, Friday's price action has been about as perfect as it gets; well, for our long fly at least. As today's move higher in NFLX is a reminder to long call buyers; when buying premium, particularly front month options close to expiration, it's not enough to be correct on direction when dealing with "out" or at-the-money premium. The size and speed of the move in the underlying are the much more important arbiters of value. 

  

  

While our fly didn't hold the same Greek risks, the allocated dollars were very similar. Not taking that truth for granted, it's fully realized our NFLX position could just as easily have proven a bad bet, despite what we saw as being a smarter position. That said, striving to hit perfection by nailing down consistency as it regards money management, rather than making the occasional psychic stock forecast, is what really defines successful option trading.

  

In appreciating Friday's bit of good fortune and as we noted on Wednesday, closing half the position on a double to $2.20 would have and still does make good sense for the long butterfly and then maybe, allowing the remainder to ride. Of course, in this particular case, doing the right thing consistently just happens to have added up to a whole lot of less cents and dollars than the picture perfect moment in time captured above.

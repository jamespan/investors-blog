**Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) stock is one blue chip stock holding up well lately and was also recently an [IBD Stock of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/disney-stock-flashes-buy-signal-on-this-1-2-punch/).


Technically, DIS stock is holding above rising 21, 50 and 200-day moving averages and the Relative Strength line has been improving for the last six weeks. The [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is currently 76


Counting against Disney stock is a weak [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 34 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of just 12. However traders wanting to take some bullish exposure in a risk defined way could look at a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to May expiration gives the trade plenty of time to work out. Yesterday, a 200 strike call option was trading around $10.40 and the 210 call was around $6.90.


Buying the 200 call and selling the 210 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $350 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100) and the maximum profit potential would be $650 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


DIS Stock Bull Call Spread Has Limited Downside
-----------------------------------------------


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if DIS stock closes below 200 on May 21, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $350 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 210. So no matter how high DIS stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $650.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to DIS stock using options. In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $3.50 to $1.50 I would consider closing early for a loss, otherwise I would hold until expiration.


Disney earnings are set for May 13, so there would be earnings risk toward the end of this trade.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

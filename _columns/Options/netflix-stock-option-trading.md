**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is a highly rated stock that has had a solid run and could be due for a pause.




Netflix stock is above upward sloping 21-, 50- and 200-day moving averages. However, after an impressive run, I'm thinking it might pause around this level.


A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Usually, this is done with monthly options, but it can also be done with weekly options. Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they would use puts.


In today's example, we'll look at a calendar spread on Netflix stock.


With Netflix stock trading around 680, setting up a calendar spread at 680 gives the trade a neutral outlook.


Selling the July 19 call option with a strike price of 680 will generate around $3,120 in premium, and buying the Aug. 2, 680 call will cost about $3,575.


Max Profit On Netflix Stock Trade Is $2,000
-------------------------------------------


That results in a net cost for the trade of $455 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.



The estimated maximum profit is around $2,000. But that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if Netflix stock remains around 680 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay faster than the bought option, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 619 and 761. But these can also change slightly depending on changes in implied volatility.


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more-advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


Profit Target, Stop Loss for Netflix Stock Trade
------------------------------------------------


For a trade like this, I would set a profit target of 30%, and I would set a stop loss if Netflix stock breaks through either 620 or 760.


The main risk with the trade is that Netflix is due to report earnings on July 18, and the options market is pricing in a potential 8.8% move in either direction.


Calendar spreads are a neutral option trading strategy. Bullish traders might consider something simpler like a bull put spread, similar to the bull call spread on **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) [explained Tuesday](https://www.investors.com/research/options/can-tesla-stock-deliver-on-profits-bull-call-spread/).


Netflix stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-netflix-nflx.aspx) of 99, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

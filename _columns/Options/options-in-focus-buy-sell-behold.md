Vertical spreads are handy, if not very adaptable strategies. Traders can look at potential income-generation verticals such as an at-the-money or in-the-money bull call or its same-strike put equivalents. The latter type allows traders wishing to accumulate shares on weakness to do so with limited risk versus a naked short put "targeted purchase" strategy. 

  

There's also out-of-the bull call spreads to consider. While traders will need some type of bullish move in the underlying to see any gains, the profit potential is greater than with the fore-mentioned verticals. Thus, if one is more confident about price movement in the underlying, the reduced likelihood of profit may nonetheless merit its use. 

  

Verticals can also be designed to either take on increased risks associated with Greeks or chopped down, depending on the trader's outlook on a particular security. For instance, while the vertical is typically approached as a way to flatten vega or volatility risk, by widening the distance between strikes and going out into options with one to three months of life left, the trader can dramatically increase that type of exposure. At the same time, this kind of positioning will also accentuate one's delta risk, but at the end of the day, still maintain the safety of a spread with limited risk.

  

To be sure, between the different contract months, strikes and the use of either calls or puts, it might seem like an insurmountable challenge to find the right spread that best suits the trader's risk and reward objectives. However, if you're willing to allocate just a small bit of the time spent looking for qualified handles, square boxes and the likes, we're quite sure you'll be glad you found a way to buy and sell successfully at the same time.

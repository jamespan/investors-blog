We're right in the thick of earnings season with results coming in daily for key companies in the S&P 500.




While it can be a risky time for option traders, there is also a lot of opportunity.


One popular trade among option traders is a short straddle that is held over the earnings announcement. This is a risky trade because it involves the sale of naked options, so it is not recommended for beginners.


The losses are potentially unlimited so always keep that in mind.


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) reports earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell so I thought it would be interesting to take a look at a short straddle using the Jan. 29 expiration.


To set up a short straddle, traders would sell the at-the-money call and the at-the-money put. AAPL stock closed at $142.92 on Monday, so the at-the-money strike would be at $143. At the close of trade yesterday, the $143 call was trading around $4.90 and the $143 put was trading for $4.95.


Selling these two options would generate $985 in premium with break-even points at $133.15 and $152.85 (the strike plus and minus the total premium).


Selling Straddles On AAPL Stock Is A Higher Risk Trade
------------------------------------------------------


Market makers set option prices based on an expected move over the life of an option. Currently the implied move for AAPL stock over earnings is around 6.89%.


This is calculated as the premium of $9.85 divided by the stock price of $142.92. It also means the stock can move up or down by 6.89% before the trade has losses at expiration.



After Apple's last earnings announcement, the stock moved -5.6%. There's no guarantee of course that the stock will stay within the expected move again this time.


Implied volatility is currently trading at 47%, much higher than the regular level seen for AAPL stock. In part this is because of the earnings announcement, as there is always a lot of uncertainty around how the numbers will come out.


Will AAPL stock stay within the expected move of 6.89% or will the move be bigger than that?


If the move is less than 6.89% the straddle sellers win. If the move is more than that, the straddle buyers win.


Selling straddles over earnings is a popular strategy for option traders, however it's important to be aware of the risks when trading naked options.

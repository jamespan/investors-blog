The market has certainly had an incredible run these past few weeks, and some highfliers may be due for a rest. If stocks do pause, a good setup is to look for quality stocks that are pulling back to key moving averages.




One stock fitting that criteria is **Amgen** ([AMGN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMGN)), the biotech giant. Amgen stock rallied from a low point near 175 all the way up to 245 and is now sitting near the 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Amgen stock is currently trading around 220, and the 200-day moving average sits around 218.


Implied volatility on Amgen stock currently sits at 30%, which is higher than the typical range of 18% to 25%.


That means it's a great time to be a seller of [options](https://www.investors.com/category/research/options/) on Amgen. That, coupled with the potential bullish action, makes it a great candidate for a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined-risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Amgen Stock And The Bullish Option Trade
----------------------------------------


With Amgen closing at 222.40 Tuesday, it makes sense to place the bull put spread below the important moving averages.


Selling a July 17 200 put and buying a 190 put would generate $140 in premium based on Tuesday's closing prices.



This trade offers a 16.28% return potential in just under two months, provided Amgen is above 200 at expiration.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $140 per contract with a maximum risk of $860. The spread would achieve the maximum profit if Amgen stock closes above 200 on July 17, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the premium seller to keep the $140 option premium.


Maximum Loss For This Trade
---------------------------


The maximum loss would occur if AMGN closes below 190 on July 17; that would force the premium seller to lose $860 on the trade. To calculate the maximum potential loss, we take the difference in the spread (10) less the premium received (1.40), which gives us 8.60. Then we multiply that by 100 to get the dollar value.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 198.60, which is calculated as 200 less the $1.40 option premium per contract.


Conservative traders may prefer to wait for a test of the moving averages, in which case the put spread could be sold for around $2.40 to $2.50.


With option trades like this, most people like to set a stop loss at two times the premium received.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment. However, a bull put spread, when done correctly, can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock or ETF with the same upside potential and less downside risk.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

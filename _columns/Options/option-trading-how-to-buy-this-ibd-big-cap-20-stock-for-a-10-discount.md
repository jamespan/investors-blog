**Mosaic** ([MOS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MOS)) was recently added to the [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and is currently showing a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 75 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93.




Mosaic reclaimed its 50-day moving average during last week's strong advance. The stock is forming the right side of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) with a 43.34 buy point.


One way to take ownership of a stock for less than the Street's price is via an option strategy called a cash-secured put.


A cash-secured put is a slightly less bullish trade than buying the stock. It is considered a neutral to slightly bullish trade.


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash in your trading account to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium or be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.



Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start with options. They are like a covered call and are pretty easy to understand once you know the basics.


Traders selling puts should understand that they may be assigned (i.e., forced to buy) 100 shares at the strike price.


Option Trading With Mosaic
--------------------------


Let's look at an example using Mosaic stock.


With the stock closing at 40 Monday, investors could sell a March put with a strike price of 38 for around $2.35.


Investors selling this put would receive $235 into their account, which would be theirs to keep. If Mosaic falls below 38 by March 18, they would be required to buy 100 shares at 38. The effective net cost of the position would be $35.65 per share, thanks to the option premium received.


That is 10.9% below Monday's closing price.


If the stock stays above 38 at expiry, the put expires worthless, leaving the trader with a 6.59% return on capital at risk. That works out to be 30.08% at an annualized rate.


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls quickly, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the premium received will help to offset the loss.


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if the fertilizer maker's shares fell to $0, which would see the trade lose $3,565, but most traders would cut losses long before then.


Generating Returns With Option Trading
--------------------------------------


Cash-secured puts are a great way to generate a return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership.


If the put does get assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base and can potentially begin selling covered calls to generate additional income from the position.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

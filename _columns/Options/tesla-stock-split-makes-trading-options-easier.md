**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) [announced a five-for-one stock split this week](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-split-announced-five-for-one-stock-jumps/) aimed at making ownership more accessible to employees and investors. While good news for Tesla stock investors, it is even better news for option traders.




As of today, investors that sell a put on TSLA stock have exposure to roughly $150,000 worth of stock with a single contract. That's a large sum and makes trading options on Tesla stock inaccessible for a lot of retail traders.


With the stock split, Tesla shares will trade around 300 rather than the current 1500.


This means that traders who sell a put option on Tesla stock will be able to do so while only risking $30,000 rather than $150,000.


Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start out with options. They are very similar to a covered call and are quite easy to understand once you know the basics.


Cash Secured Put For Tesla Stock
--------------------------------



A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock.


The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


We previously looked at an [example on Delta stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/delta-stock-how-to-trade-cash-secured-put-option/) which is working out well.


Trading in TSLA stock will be on a split adjusted basis from August 31, so mark that date on your calendar if you're a put seller that likes Tesla.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

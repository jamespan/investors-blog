**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) is showing the lowest level of implied volatility that we've seen in two years. That could mean it's a good time to be a buyer of volatility in MU stock.




We can do this via a strategy called a long strangle, which is constructed through buying an out-of-the-money call and an out-of-the-money put.


Buying a long strangle is cheaper than a buying a long straddle, but will still suffer from time decay. That means the options will lose a little bit of value with each day that passes if the stock doesn't make a big move.


With a long strangle, the further out in time the trade is placed, the slower the time decay, but the options are more expensive and require more capital.


For MU stock, a long strangle could be placed by buying a 90 strike call and a 75 strike put for the Sept. 20 expiration. The call was trading Tuesday around $7.85 and the put around $5.45.


MU Stock Trade Break-Even Levels
--------------------------------


When we add the two together, the total cost of the trade would be around $13.30 per contract or $1,330.


This is the total amount of risk in the trade and the maximum that could be lost.



The break-even prices are calculated by taking the strike price plus and minus the cost of the strangle.


That gives us break-even prices of 61.70 and 103.30. But profits can be made with a smaller move if the move comes earlier in the trade. For example, the estimated break-even prices at the end of January are around 68 and 87.50.


Changes to implied volatility will have a big impact on this trade and the interim break-even prices. So it's important to have a solid understanding of volatility before placing a trade like this.


Idea Scenario For MU Stock Strangle
-----------------------------------


The ideal scenario is a large move in either direction within the first week or two of the trade.


The worst-case scenario with this MU stock long strangle would be a stable stock price. That would see the call and put slowly lose value each day. For a long strangle, I usually set a stop loss at around 20% of capital at risk, which would be around $260, and a profit target of around 40%.


Micron Technology is due to report earnings toward the end of March, and implied volatility is likely to drop after that event.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-micron-technology-mu.aspx), MU stock is ranked No. 4 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 60, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 3 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91.

When we last discussed IBD 50 constituent and diet supplement supplier **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) our focus was on the company's rather illiquid options whose protective qualities, for those fortunate to be long the stock, could still make sense to use in the real world of trading and minimizing risk exposure. 

  

A couple weeks later and it appears traders are now seriously out of their minds and insane for call options, despite still very meager liquidity provision. But are they really? More than 55,000 contracts have traded Thursday with 90% plus of that volume concentrated in a slug of May in-the-money calls. The reality is today's feeding frenzy is actually not about being overly bullish but really about trying to game or play Friday's ex-dividend date. 

  

The ex-dividend date provides existing long shareholders with an eventual payout of $20 per 100 shares in HLF. The way mostly professional fast money option traders who maintain ultra low commission schedules will look to play the dividend is through negotiated swapping of buy-writes or verticals with similarly positioned parties.

  

By buying and selling the same in-the-money call strikes (which also need to meet the requirement of having high existing open interest) with both sides of these two strategies, traders are hoping to capture the dividend through another party's error of not exercising their own long call contract. You see, being long a deep call will mimic a stock as it ticks up and down (if its deep enough), but when it comes to dividends, that same long call, if not exchanged for stock, will forfeit the dividend payout allocated to shareholders. 

  

In a nutshell, which the action does kind of resemble, today's very active traders are all gunning for the same thing. And that thing is, is to exercise their negotiated long contracts from today's trading, which compliments of the O.C.C. aren't washed out from their sold calls on the same strike. Then, crossing their fingers and ever hopeful, they'll wish that someone long within the existing pool of open interest forgets to do their own form of exercising tonight or simply decides not to for personal financial or risk related reasons. 

  

If some of these existing longs do feel compelled not to act and don't exercise their contracts, which in this day and age is "slimmer and slimmer" to come by, some traders through the gift giving lottery process, (also overseen by the O.C.C.) will wake up with buy-writes in their accounts due to their unassigned short calls. And in a perfect world, those buy-writes will be profitable by the amount of the dividend or $20. 

  

The biggest risk with this strategy is if you find you wake up with all these potentially profitable buy-writes, but for whatever reason, shares fall hard enough before you have the opportunity to lock in that profit. You see, where there's open profit, there's also risk. And in this situation, that's in the form of a synthetic short put you've sold at $0.20 and one that might need tending in a world that's less than perfect sometimes.

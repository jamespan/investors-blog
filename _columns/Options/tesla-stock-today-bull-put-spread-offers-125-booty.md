**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) bounced back on Friday, closing up 8.2% on the day. It looks like this mini downtrend might be over. So, if you are looking for a more conservative way to play Tesla stock using options, consider the bull put spread.


As a reminder, a bull put spread is a defined risk strategy, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance. This type of trade will profit if Tesla stock trades sideways or higher. You can even sometimes land a profit if the stock trades slightly lower.


Traders who think Tesla will stay above 350 for the next few weeks could sell a Feb. 21-expiration 350-345 bull put spread for around $1.25 per set of options, or $125, according to recent trading. In this trade, you sell the 350 strike put (the higher-priced option strike) and buy the lower-priced 345 strike put for protection on the downside.




The [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) in Tesla stock has risen to 357. Plus, there is also strong technical support at 375.


Tesla Stock Today: The Bull Put Spread
--------------------------------------


Selling this spread in Tesla stock would generate roughly $125 in premium. The trade also carries a maximum risk of $375.


If the spread expires worthless that would be a 33% return in seven weeks — provided Tesla stock is above 350 at expiration.


The maximum loss would occur if Tesla stock closes below 345 on Feb. 21. In this case, the premium seller loses $375 on the trade. 



The break-even point for the trade is 348.75, simply calculated as 350 less the $1.25 option premium received per contract. I would set a stop loss if the loss is equal to the amount of premium received, or in this case $125.


Sticking to this stop loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), TSLA stock ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 91, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 78 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

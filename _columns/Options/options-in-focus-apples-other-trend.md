With just more than an hour left in the session, IBD 50 constituent and S&P 500 muscle **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was trading up about 0.90% and following through slightly on Monday's breakout of a short consolidation. The price action puts shares at fresh all-time highs and a bit less than 2% removed from its proper buy point courtesy of a flat base some four weeks in length which found support by way of its 50-day simple moving average.

  

Option traders have shown their support or maybe lack thereof by favoring calls by a slightly greater than normal margin of 1.5-to-1 and letting implieds continue to slip. For their part, weekly and regular February contracts are in the lower quartile of their 52-week trading range, while March premium is actually setting fresh two year lows.

  

April is also at trading at range lows but its 24% at-the-money bid is a couple points higher than March's roughly 22% IV reading and that month is trading above February's 19% - 20% levels. So, what gives as all of these contracts fall outside of the earnings cycle?

  

The big influence and reason for the positive skew the further out one goes is traders are in effect betting Apple's longer-term downtrend in its underlying or statistical volatility, could be due for some reversion to the mean; with the word "some" stressed. 

  

In the end, as Apple moved from a smaller but still large cult-like following during a very strong growth phase worthy of vaulting shares into the market's second most well-capitalized company; the character of its underlying stock has changedâ€”and lesser volatility, the new normal. 

  

Apple, for better or worse, and that depends on the trader one asks; has grown up. As much, it would be silly to think at this stage shares could move as freely as they once did as it becomes more and more difficult to pull off hyper-like growth without another revolutionary new product that defines consumerism. Of course this is still Apple so I won't say "never" to that possibility. But without the assistance of another exogenous and historic market event like the credit crisis; I'd say the possibility of price volatility making a strong and sustainable comeback are slimmer than a Mac Air.

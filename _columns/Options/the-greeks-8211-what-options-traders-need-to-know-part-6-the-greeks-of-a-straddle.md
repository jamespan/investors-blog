How and why option prices change is a mystery to many options traders. This is the sixth in a series of articles that discuss the seemingly complex topic of options price behavior and the "Greeks." The topic today is how the Greeks of individual options are combined to help traders analyze multiple-part option strategies. An understanding of the Greeks of option positions gives traders specific stock price targets that can be used to evaluate forecasts and choose strategies. 

  

**Introduction** 

  

The first step for options traders being introduced to the Greeks is to understand how prices of individual options change when stock price, time to expiration, volatility or the interest rate change. The second step is to analyze two-part options strategies such as straddles and vertical spreads. This article will first define a specific spread strategy and then show how the Greeks of the individual options are combined so that the entire spread position can be analyzed. 

  

The previous article in this series, Part 5 — rho, concluded that a change in the interest rate assumption has a minor impact on option prices that most traders can ignore rho. This article will follow that conclusion and focus only on the delta, gamma, vega and theta of the spread strategy discussed. 

  

**Straddle Defined** 

  

A straddle involves the simultaneous purchase of a call and put with the same underlying stock, the same strike price and the same expiration date. Exhibit 1 is a profit and loss diagram of a 60-strike straddle at expiration purchased for 4.46 per spread. In Exhibit 1 it is assumed that the 60 Call and 60 Put were purchased for 2.24 per share and 2.22 per share, respectively.

**Straddle Greeks Calculated** 

  

Exhibit 2 shows the six assumed inputs for the 60 Call and 60 Put that make up the straddle in Exhibit 1 and the outputs of the option pricing formula. The inputs are a stock price and strike price of $60.00, days to expiration of 35, an interest rate of 0.40%, no dividends and volatility of 30%. The outputs are the option prices and the Greeks.

**Straddle Greeks Analyzed** 

  

Notice is that the Greeks of the individual options are added together to get the Greeks of the total position. For example, the delta of the 60 Call, +0.52, is added to the delta of the 60 Put, -0.48, to get the delta of the 60 Straddle of +0.04. A newcomer's first reaction might be that the delta of the 60 Put was subtracted from the delta of the 60 Call, but it must be remembered that the delta of the 60 Put is negative. Therefore, the deltas of the two options were added to get the delta of the two-part straddle position. 

  

So what do the Greeks tell us? Let's start with the delta of +0.04, which is pretty close to zero. By itself, this delta tells us that the straddle will make only four cents of the stock price rises one dollar and that it will lose four cents if the stock price falls one dollar. Such a small amount of profit or loss might discourage a trader from considering such a trade. But don't give up yet. Let's consider the gamma. 

  

The gamma of +0.14 says that the delta will rise from +0.04 to +0.18 if the stock price rises by one dollar. And the delta will continue to rise if the stock price keeps rising. On the downside, if the stock price falls, the delta will fall from +0.04 to -0.12 for the first dollar stock price decline. The delta will then decline to -0.26 with the next dollar decline, and the delta will keep declining if the stock price keeps declining. 

  

Considering the delta and gamma together, we see that the delta of the straddle starts out at +0.04, which is near zero, but then it rises if the stock price rises and falls if the stock price falls. This is good if the stock price makes a "big" move in either direction. 

  

The vega of the straddle, like the delta and gamma, is the sum of the vegas of the 60 Call and 60 Put. Essentially, this means that the straddle is twice as sensitive to changes in volatility as is each individual option. The positive sign, or plus sign, indicates that rising volatility increases the options' prices, so a rise in volatility would help a straddle and a decrease in volatility would hurt. 

  

The theta of the straddle is also the sum of the thetas of the 60 Call and 60 Put. And, since owning one option is hurtful with the passing of time, owning a straddle will be twice as bad. The negative sign, or minus sign, indicates that time passing to expiration causes the straddle to lose its value. 

  

So what do the Greeks of the straddle tell an option trader about its opportunities and risks? Conceptually, the delta and gamma indicate that a "big" stock price change is needed. The vega tells that rising volatility is good and that falling volatility is bad, and the negative theta tells us that passing time is a double negative. 

  

**Specific Numbers Generated** 

  

But the Greeks tell options traders more than concepts. The Greeks assign actual numbers — dollars of opportunity and risk — to spread positions. 

  

The delta and gamma indicate that this straddle will make roughly 11 cents for the first dollar stock price rise. This is calculated by taking the average of beginning delta of +0.04 and estimated ending delta of +0.18. Similarly, it can be calculated that the straddle will make 20 cents for the second dollar stock price rise, 29 cents for the third dollar rise, etc. And the theta tells us that the straddle will lose about 47 cents in seven days if the stock price does not change and volatility remains constant. 

  

Considering delta, gamma and theta together, a trader can estimate that the stock price must rise over two points in the first week in order for the straddle to break even, and a larger stock price is needed for the straddle to make money. On the downside, the stock price move must be a little larger, because the delta starts out slightly positive. These are specific numbers that a trader can use in making a forecast. There is no guaranty that a forecast will be accurate, but specific numbers are helpful in making trading decisions.

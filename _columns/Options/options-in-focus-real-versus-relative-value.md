The term "value" can be highly subjective when it comes to investing. In the world of options trading, some of that determination can be increased, if we see a situation that sports relative value when comparing one contract to other surrounding contracts. Typically, traders using calculated values from a trading platform of their choice will simply notice the implied volatility of the contract, either a call or put, in question, is priced differently than other nearby options.

  

An alternative means to recognizing this kind of value can be accomplished by lining up synthetic markets. This is a useful exercise for traders looking to remain sharp and reliant on their own mental facilities and a skill, which still has a place in investing, despite all the whiz-bang technology out there.

  

Hypothetically, let's consider a call market in conjunction with stock to form a synthetic put and compare it to the pricing of a real listed put contract. When the call is examined as part of this relationship (a synthetic put) and appears cheap versus the actual put contract, there's a good but not guaranteed case for having uncovered relative value.

  

Why would or how could this disparity occur? Typically, it's one of two factors or possibly both. For one, traders might be seeing some temporary order flow in a less liquid name. In this type situation there won't ordinarily be much in the way of customer paper and / or demand. As much, market makers update those quotes in a mostly hands off manner by inputting implied volatilities initially and then leaving the product to be quoted and updated automatically with nary any further human intervention.

  

Secondarily and when it comes to a call looking cheap in relation to its synthetic equivalent of the same strike and other surrounding calls, a trader could be seeing a hard-to-borrow situation. When shares are hard to borrow or impossible to short, calls can quite often trade at a theoretical discount to puts as the natural hedge to reduce delta or directional risk is with short stock, which is unavailable to borrow short.

  

When shares to short can't be located by one's broker, traders wishing to get long or short deltas without this meddlesome restriction will trade long puts in conjunction with long stock. This action or demand brings increased value to the puts, which goes beyond theoretical considerations and into the realm of real world applications.

  

Depending on those traders' directional outlook or fresh positions after establishing this long put / long stock combination; he or she can adjust deltas effortlessly by selling some existing long stock inventory. That's in stark contrast to the long call trader who at the same time may be quickly realizing his or her "bargain" is less than they bargained for when needing a quick hedge.

When the market hasn't had a decent correction for a while, it can be an excellent time to think about portfolio protection with VIX options.




The [Big Picture](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) shows a confirmed uptrend with four [distribution days](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-market-tops-distribution-days/) on the S&P 500 and two on the Nasdaq. That being said, traders with a large bullish expose may want to consider adding some protection.


One way to do that is via an options trade known as a ladder. Let's look at an example using VIX options.


To set up a call ladder, we sell an at-the-money call option. Then buy an out-of-the-money call and another further out-of-the-money call.


We receive a credit from selling the at-the-money call and pay debits for the two out-of-the-money call purchases.


The goal is to place the trade for a net credit, or at worst, zero cost.


Using the October expiration, that might look something like this:


VIX Option Trade
----------------


Sell 1 Oct. 19, 18 call @ 5.70


Buy 1 Oct. 19, 25 call @ 3.35


Buy 1 Oct. 19, 32.50 call at 2.20


We receive $570 for selling the 18-strike call and pay $555 for buying the 25 and 32.50 strike calls.


Therefore, the trade meets the criteria of being placed for a credit, with the net credit received equal to $15.


This trade will give some protection in the event of a spike in volatility in the coming weeks.


Holding Period
--------------


I would typically hold this hedge trade for around three weeks and then close it out if it is no longer needed.


VIX options behave slightly differently from stock options, so make sure you understand how they work before risking any live capital.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

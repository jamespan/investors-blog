  Dollar Rebounds As FOMC Meeting Makes Case For Profit Taking

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose for the first time in three days, with higher Treasury yields lending support to the currency as investors' focus turns to the Federal Reserve meeting that begins on Tuesday.


Given the dollar gauge holds its downtrend since the beginning of the year and is down 0.8% this month, there's scope for investors to scale back their short exposure, according to traders in London and Europe. Currently, market pricing of a Fed hike by year-end stands just below 50% and traders expect Chair Janet Yellen to keep her options open for December. Main focus will be on the policymakers' view on 2018 rate-hike plans as balance-sheet reduction is already priced in.


As well as Fed risk, leveraged investors bought back dollars vs. the pound as lack of follow through after cable hit a fresh year-to-date high at $1.3619 brought a round of sterling supply. Short-term investors took profits on longs initiated since Bank of England's policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe's hawkish comments on Sept. 15, said the traders, who asked not to be identified as they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Pound traders focus switches to Governor Mark Carney's speech due later Monday in Washington.


Cable dropped 0.4% to $1.3537 as of 10:39 a.m. London. Its positive momentum is far from gone, as risk reversals keep extending their recent run higher. The magnitude of the pound's rally within a short period of time, coupled with lack of technical resistances up to levels above $1.3800, have option traders seeking low-delta exposure. The spread between 25-delta and 10-delta risk reversals stands at its lowest since June 2009.

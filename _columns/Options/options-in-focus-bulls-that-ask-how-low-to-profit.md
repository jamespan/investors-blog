As a bullish option trader, sometimes the question of asking, "How low?" versus "How high?" makes more sense when looking to find a more suitable position based on what's available in a stock's calls and puts and one's assessment of risk. Given the broader market's quick shifting of gears from being in a correction per Investors Business Daily's Big Picture to a "gap happy, right back-atcha", "Market in Confirmed Uptrend"; this may be one of those times. 

  

For those in agreement, one idea to explore is the use of an out-of-the money bull put vertical credit spread or its risk equivalent in-the-money bull call debit spread. These types of positions use either all puts or all calls and consist of buying a lower, same month strike relative to a sold higher strike. In turn, this allows for profits to be made if shares go up much in the same way profits would accrue from being long stock. A drawback to any vertical position is profits are limited as well, unless an opportune adjustment is made during the life of the position. As well, profit maximization is generally slower to come prior to expiration. 

  

One substantial bonus with these positions and something not possible with long stock is profits are also possible if shares sit or even go down. In fact, the trader can even realize their maximum profit potential as long as the underlying remains above the higher sold strike at expiration. After a couple days of obvious market sponsorship from bulls, but action that's also perhaps looking technically extended, positioning for "How low?" might seem more approachable than otherwise.

  

  

Secondly, verticals maintain a limited risk price structure. Limited risk means all subjectivity over what's at stake dollar-wise, is removed in the event of an unwanted, larger-than-expected bearish gap in the stock. With the vertical the trader knows exactly how much capital is at risk. This calculation is based on the difference in strikes minus the credit received for a put vertical or simply the debit paid in the case of a bull call spread. 

  

In the end, stock traders long shares can try, but sizing risk off a stop loss such as the commonly used money management tool of 7% to 8% isn't the same thing as a guarantee as with using a vertical. Case in point is today's price action in recent IPO and social networking giantÂ **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) which opened down nearly 14% or yesterday's former growth flavor **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) which flamed out by 25% when all was said and done. 

  

Truthfully, both those stocks would have been less than ideal stuff for "How low?" vertical positioning in front of their earnings events. However, any 'guarantees' fulfilled in full today, didn't have to sweat extra damage control maneuvering, removed the potential even larger blowout risks with stocks and ultimately allow traders to live to fight another day financially and mentally stronger.

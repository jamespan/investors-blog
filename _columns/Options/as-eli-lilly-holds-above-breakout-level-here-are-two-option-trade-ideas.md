**Eli Lilly** ([LLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LLY)) last week broke out above a 284 buy point from a [cup-without-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) and is holding above that key level. 




The drug manufacturing company develops, manufactures and sells pharmaceutical products and animal health products. On Thursday, the [FDA rejected a lung cancer drug Lilly was testing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/lly-stock-fda-rejects-cheap-cancer-drug-here-is-what-is-next/), but the stock still rose.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Lilly stock ranks No. 2 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 88 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93. 


The stock is currently trading above its 50- and 200-day moving averages, and those moving averages are sloping upward. That's generally a bullish sign. 


Lilly Bull Put Spread Idea
--------------------------


With the stock holding up well, investors could look to sell a 270-265 bull put spread for the April 14 expiration. That spread was trading around $0.80 a share Wednesday. 


I would look to put in an order to sell the spread for $1 and see if Lilly stock comes down a bit in order for the spread to get filled. 


This would offer a potential 25% return in three weeks, provided Lilly stock is above 270 at expiration. 


The maximum profit on the trade would be $100 per contract with a maximum risk of $400.


The maximum loss would occur if Lilly closes below 265 on April 14, which would see the premium seller lose $400 on the trade.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is $269, which is calculated as $270 less the $1 option premium per contract. If the spread doesn't get filled, I would just move on to the next opportunity. 


Lilly Stock Cash Secured Put
----------------------------



Another idea would be to sell the 270 put as a cash-secured put. This would generate around $2.50 in premium, with a break-even price of $267.50. 


This strategy requires a lot more capital because the maximum loss would be $26,750 and would occur if Lilly shares went to zero. 


Similar to the bull put spread idea, if I wanted a bit more margin for error in the trade, I might set up the order around $3.50 instead of $2.50 and wait to see if it gets filled. A stop loss could be set at around 265. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

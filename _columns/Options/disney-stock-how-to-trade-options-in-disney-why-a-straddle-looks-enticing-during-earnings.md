We're right in the thick of [earnings season](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/) with results coming in daily for key companies in the S&P 500, including Disney stock next week. While it can be a risky time for option traders, there is also a lot of opportunity.




One popular trade among option traders is a short straddle that is held over the earnings announcement. This is a risky trade because it involves the sale of naked options, so it is not recommended for beginners.


The losses are potentially unlimited so always keep that in mind.


**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) reports earnings this coming Tuesday after the closing bell. So I thought it would be interesting to do a little case study and analyze how the options perform over this period. Specifically, we'll look at a short straddle with a May 8 expiration date.



To set up a short straddle, traders would sell the at-the-money call and the at-the-money put. DIS stock recently traded near 106.75 on Thursday, so the at-the-money strike would be at $107. At the close of play on Thursday, the $107 call was trading around $4.26 and the $107 put was trading for $3.00. Selling these two options would generate $726 in premium with break-even points at $99.74 and $114.26.


Here's how the trade would look.


Market makers set option prices based on an expected move over the life of an option. Currently the implied move for Disney stock over earnings is around 6.26%. This is calculated as the premium of $7.26 divided by the stock price of $106.40. It also means the stock can move up or down by 6.26% before the trade starts to suffer losses.


Disney Stock: How It Behaves After Quarterly Earnings
-----------------------------------------------------



After Disney's last earnings announcement, the stock fell only 2.3%. There's no guarantee of course that the stock will stay within the expected move again this time. Implied volatility is currently trading at 41%, much higher than the regular level seen for DIS which is around 22%.


In part this is because of the earnings announcement as there is always a lot of uncertainty around how the numbers will come out. The current market consensus is for fiscal second-quarter earnings per share to fall 40% to 96 cents on revenue of $18.22 billion, up 22%. This compares to earnings of $1.53 and revenue of $20.9 billion in the previous quarter.

The Expected Move In Disney Stock
---------------------------------


Let's see how the earnings numbers look and what the stock does afterward. Will it stay within the expected move of 6.26% or will the move be bigger than that?


If the move is less than 6.26% the straddle sellers win. If the move is more than that, the straddle buyers win. Selling straddles over earnings is a popular trade for option traders, however it's important to be aware of the risks when trading naked options.


Just a reminder that this isn't a trade recommendation, but rather an opportunity to analyze and learn how the option markets work. Check back next week for an update on how this went.

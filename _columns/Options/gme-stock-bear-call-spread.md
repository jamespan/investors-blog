The wallstreetbets-reddit crowd are at it again, pushing **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) stock back up to near 250.




The prior short squeeze saw GME stock rise rapidly to 483.


Let's assume we think that high won't get taken out again and that normality will eventually return. We could look at selling an out-of-the-money bear call spread.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call. The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiration.


There is no way I would risk trading uncovered options on a stock like GME, but a bear call spread is a risk defined strategy, so we always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


Let's look at an example using the July option chain. This gives GME stock a few months to return to more normal levels.


GME Stock Bear Call Spread
--------------------------


A July expiration bear call spread could be set up using the 490 strike as the short call and the 500 strike as the long call. That spread was trading around $1.40 yesterday. I would wait to see if GME stock rallies a bit more and consider selling that spread if it reached $4.00.


If filled, the maximum profit on the trade would be $400 per contract with a maximum risk of $600.


The spread would achieve the maximum profit if GME stock closes below 490 on July 16 in which case the entire spread would expire worthless allowing the trader to keep the $400 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if GME stock closes above 500 on July 16 which would see the premium seller lose $600 on the trade.



For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss if the spread increases in value to $700 or if GME stock closes above 450.


Trading volatile stocks like GameStop is risky but can provide a nice return if the trade works out. GME earnings are scheduled for March 23, so there is earnings risk with this trade.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

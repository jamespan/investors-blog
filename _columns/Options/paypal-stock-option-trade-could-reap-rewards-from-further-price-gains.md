With the stock market [uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-weakens-sp500-below-50-day-why-investors-must-turn-cautious/), traders wanting to take bullish exposure may want to think about doing so in a limited-risk way. 




One way to do that is via options, using a bullish butterfly spread. 


**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) was a recent Stock of the Day after [clearing an early entry](https://www.investors.com/news/paypal-stock-microsoft-among-long-term-leaders-in-buy-zones/) at 277.96. Traders can gain some upside exposure in a low-risk way via a bullish butterfly.


Butterfly spreads involve three different option strikes, all within the same expiration date, and can be created using either calls or puts. 


By trading a butterfly with a bullish bias, we can place the trade cheaply and have a large potential payoff.


Assuming we have a price target of 320 for PayPal stock within the next few months. Let's look at how we can set up a bullish butterfly based on those parameters. 


* Buy one Oct. 15, 300-strike price call at $14.25
* Sell two Oct. 15, 320-strike calls at $10.80
* Buy one Oct. 15, 340-strike call at $4.60


This trade only costs around $275 per spread but has a payoff potential much higher than that. 


The ideal scenario is for PYPL stock to be right around 320 at expiration on Oct. 15.


Maximum Profit Of $1,725 On PayPal Stock Option Play
----------------------------------------------------



The maximum loss on the trade is equal to the premium paid of around $275 per contract. This would occur anywhere below 300 or above 340 on PayPal shares. 


The maximum potential profit on the trade is $1,725. This is calculated by taking the width of the butterfly (20) times 100 less the premium paid ($275). 


Taking a low-risk trade like this can be one way to participate in any further rally without risking too much capital. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

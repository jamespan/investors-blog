"Yeesh!" Bulls caught holding shares of **Ebix** ([EBIX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EBIX)) and bystanders simply taking a peek might be heard muttering something along those lines Thursday. The soon-to-be former IBD 50 constituent got under the skin of investors today following mysterious word of a "cautious newsletter" made its way around trading desks. 

  

Option traders should also be wary and respect the "Yeesh!" factor. Today's intraday plummet in excess of 24% has attracted volume in excess of 11,000 contracts. However, any real liquidity provision will be tough to come by in the coming days if, and we believe it will, historical tendencies of very loose quoted markets and minimal investor participation make their way back onto the scene.

  

So, what are traders doing today if conditions are so detrimental to one's financial health? Well, I'd suspect there's a fair amount of activity trying to do nothing more than make markets by scalping order flow and walking away with no or vastly reduced position size at the end of the day. 

  

We'll know a bit more about that tomorrow when concentrated spots of interest such as the April 20 put which has traded nearly 6,500 contracts versus open interest of just 100 or the 2,800 April 25 calls that have been put up, have their open interest stats re-worked overnight by the crew at the Options Clearing Corp. 

  

However, during the worst of today's sell-off, individual quoted call and put markets were the kind deemed wide enough for a big rig to park itself between. As much, the non-recommended practice of putting out bids and offers, waiting to see if any contracts get hit or taken and then quickly looking to scalp, was probably too much of a dangling carrot for some traders to ignore. 

  

And for a few fast, program trading money types, today's slippery slope did come about as an intraday move rather than an overnight gap. What that could mean is any bids and offers that might have been left as good 'til cancelled orders, were more apt to be filled than would otherwise be the case. For those traders that did manage to take the other side of that sort of call and put paper, I'm sure there's no crying over today's technical reminder of fallouts that happen in both mad money and healthy market environments.

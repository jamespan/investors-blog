Earnings season kicks off this week with [banks starting to report earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/bank-earnings-among-first-q4-results-as-profit-outlook-deteriorates/) on Friday before the market opens.




We have **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)), **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) and **First Republic Bank** ([FRC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FRC)) all due to report on Friday.


It is shaping up to be a busy week and could give traders an early indicator of how this earnings season will measure up.


Those who are wondering what sort of moves to expect in bank stocks can use the options market to gain an insight into the market expectations.


Calculating Expected Move
-------------------------


We can use what is called the expected move. This tells us the market's expected range for an underlying stock for a specific period.


The quickest way to work out the expected move is to look up the stock's option chain and add together the price of the at-the-money put option and the at-the-money call option. We use the first expiry date *after* the earnings date.


While this approach isn't as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate.


Bank Stocks' Expected Moves
---------------------------


Citigroup options are pricing in a 4.90% move. Citi stock has stayed within the expected range five out of the last six reports.


Bank of America stock options are also implying a 4.90% move. BAC stock has stayed within the expected range four out of the last six times.



JPMorgan stock options indicate an expected move of around 3.80%. The stock has stayed within the expected range four out of the last six reports. Five of the last six post-earnings moves have been to the downside.


Option traders in Wells Fargo stock expect slightly bigger moves, with the range expected to be around 5%. WFC stock has stayed within the expected range four out of the last six times.


First Republic options are pricing in a 5.90% move. FRC stock has stayed within the expected range four out of the last six times.


Good luck this week, traders.

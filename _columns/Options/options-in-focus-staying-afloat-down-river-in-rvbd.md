In Wednesday's session, **Riverbed Technology** ([RVBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVBD)) has proven a strong lesson in not trading handles prematurely. I'm sadly kidding, but shares did crater from the coveted pattern development as part of a double-bottom base. Instead, bulls awoke to the stock succumbing to a heady overnight gap, which quickly reworked the price chart into a triple bottom formation much to the chagrin of positioned longs after the company, amongst other evils issued a slightly soft outlook. 

  

More to the point than calling out all the apparent institutional cheaters out there who took on the stock in very heavy and well-bid action within the handle, is the option for those same bulls to have had a stronger and definitive stop loss in place for emergencies like today's price action has summoned. 

  

We're of course talking about the use of puts in conjunction with stock or option strategies such as a stock substitute which uses a limited risk long call position or any one of numerous spreads which can be created to define risk to a known amount. 

  

Yesterday in this daily column, we wrote bullishly about Riverbed in front of the report with what looked like a ratio credit front-spread action in it's "at and out-of-the money" August 41 and 40 puts. We went on to temper the riskier net short position by discussing the use of a modified butterfly in attempting to collect on any out-of-the money credits. 

  

We purposely didn't go into further detail as to whether choosing a broken wing butterfly with its wider bull put spread and greater downside risk or the more conservative but smaller credit closed wing structure looked better to us. One thing is for sure, both those positions are also down river today, but those bulls are still afloat compared to their long stock brethren and as stated, are more "free to handle other positions with a bit more confidence" and capital still in the bank.

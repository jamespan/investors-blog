The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) tool shows **Shake Shack** ([SHAK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHAK)) is ranked 17th in its group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 40, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 62 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 19.




Shake Shack stock is also hitting resistance at a declining 20-day moving average. To me, that looks like a good setup for a bearish option trade.


Traders thinking the stock will stay below the 20-day moving average could look at doing a bear call spread. A bear call spread is a bearish option strategy that will profit if the stock falls, stays flat and sometimes even if the stock rises slightly.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


Shake Shack Stock: Options Bears Can Still Make Money If It Rises
-----------------------------------------------------------------


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways or even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry.


On Shake Shack stock, a bear call spread could be set up using the 55 strike as the short call and the 60 strike as the long call.


As of Friday, this trade offered a 28.2% return on risk over the next month when using the options expiring Aug. 21.



The maximum profit on the trade would be $110 per contract with a maximum risk of $390. The spread would achieve the maximum 28.2% profit if SHAK stock closes below 55 on August 21, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless allowing the premium seller to keep the $110 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if SHAK stock closes above 60 on Aug. 21; this would see the premium seller lose $390 on the trade.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk defined strategy. So, you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


In this case, SHAK stock could go to 500 (unlikely) and the most this trade would lose is $390.


Where To Cut Losses
-------------------


The break-even point for the bear call spread is 56.10, which is calculated as 55 plus the $1.10 option premium per contract. Keep in mind that due to the bid-ask spread, you may not be able to get filled at these prices.


For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss if the stock broke back above the 20- and 50 day moving averages. Therefore, if Shake Shack stock breaks above the 53-54 level, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Shake Shack has scheduled earnings for July 30. That could provide a catalyst for the stock to shoot higher. Trading options over earnings can be very risky.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

In front of tonight's earnings release, growth favorite and web-based travel goliath **Priceline** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) was fairly quiet judging by a ticker showing nary any movement from last night's close with shares off fractionally. Elsewhere though, traders were spied as being maybe a bit more on edge as evidenced by PCLN's well-bid weekly April at-the-monies pricing. 

  

With just one session left before those option contracts are either in-the-money or out-of-the money and with shares at 537 intraday, the long 535 / 540 strangle or the 535 or 540 straddle markets are about as close to an over/under bet on trader expectations regarding Friday's post earnings verdict as one could ask for. 

  

In truth and impacting premiums as well, there is that closely-watched item called the monthly jobs report. Traders bidding for protection could also be paying a bit more than otherwise due to tomorrow being the one-year anniversary of the ignominious Flash Crash.

  

  

What could possibly go wrong? Well, in this trader's estimation and looking above at $36 of sold premium constructed from a one lot strangle, a lot potentially could go wrong. However, given the magnitude of what type of move would be required to make those sellers wish they hadn't booked those positions would be giving those delta neutral bulls a lot more "credit", pardon the pun, than I think they deserve.

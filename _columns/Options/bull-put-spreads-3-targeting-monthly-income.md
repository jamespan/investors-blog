This is the fifth and final article in a series on vertical options spreads and the third of three specifically on bull put spreads. Vertical spreads are an intermediate-level options strategy with a wide variety of uses. Traders who use vertical spreads must first understand the strategy mechanics, i.e., what happens at expiration. Second, it is necessary to understand the nuances of the price behavior of vertical spreads prior to expiration, and, third, a two-step plan for trading a vertical spread is an important part of using vertical spreads successfully.

  

**Bull Put Spread Reviewed**

  

The sale of one put and simultaneous purchase of a second put with the same underlying and same expiration but with a *lower strike price* is known as a bull put spread. Graph 1 illustrates a Bull Put Spread in which one XYZ 50 Put is sold for 1.70, and one XYZ 45 Put is purchased for 0.60.

  

**Bull Put Spreads as a Trading Strategy** 

  

As the following example describes, the bull put spread strategy is suited for investors who seek to add monthly income and limited risk at the same time.

  

Gary is an aggressive investor who wants to increase his monthly income and is willing to accept a moderate amount of risk if that risk is truly limited. Gary follows several stocks, and when he believes that a stock is either in an uptrend or near the lower end of a trading range, he will trade out-of-the-money bull put spreads in an attempt to earn 5% in a month on the capital he places at risk. Let's follow Gary as he makes this month's trade.

  

XYZ is one of the stocks that Gary follows. It is currently trading at $88, which, in Gary's opinion, is near the low end of a bullish channel. Gary feels that there is little risk of XYZ declining to $80 between now and April expiration, which is 23 days away. He, therefore, establishes the XYZ April 75-80 bull put spread by selling one XYZ April 80 Put at 0.90 (90 cents) and, simultaneously, purchasing one XYZ April 75 Put for 0.60 (60 cents).

  

The resulting bull put spread is established for a net credit of 0.30 (30 cents) per share, or $30 per spread, before commissions. $30 is also the maximum profit potential. The amount of capital at risk — and the margin deposit required — is $470 per spread. The maximum risk of a bull put spread is the difference between the strike prices less the net credit received, not including commissions. Since 30/470 is approximately 0.06, or 6%, this spread meets Gary's target of 5% potential profit on capital at risk in one month.

  

If Gary holds this spread to option expiration — an approach that is not advised for the reasons explained later — then the price of XYZ could be above $80, between $75 and $80, or below $75. If XYZ is above $80, then both puts expire, and Gary keeps the net premium received of 0.30 per share or $30 per spread. As noted above, this profit meets Gary's goal of earning 5% on capital at risk in one month.

  

If the price of XYZ stock is between $75 and $80, then Gary's short 80 Put will be assigned, and he will purchase XYZ stock at an effective price of $79.70 (the assignment price of 80.00 less the 0.30 net premium received from the spread). If XYZ is below $75 at expiration, then the maximum potential loss of 4.70 per share or $470 per spread will occur.

  

**Maximum Risk versus Probability of Loss**

  

Some options traders object to the way Gary set up his bull put spread in the example above. "Why risk $470 to make $30?" some traders ask. "One maximum loss wipes out sixteen maximum profits!" other traders complain. 

  

When hearing these objections for the first time, one's reaction might be, "Yes, Gary's approach is risky." However, there are three countervailing reasons that Gary's approach is valid. First, Gary has exercised judgment in timing the market and in choosing XYZ stock. He follows XYZ and other stocks, and he establishes bull put spreads only when he thinks the timing is right. Obviously, just as any trader's judgment can be wrong, so too can Gary's be wrong. Nevertheless, if Gary's judgment is "more right than wrong," then his profitable trades should outnumber his losing trades.

  

Second, in the example above, XYZ stock was trading at $88 when Gary established the 75-80 bull put spread. This means that XYZ stock has to fall $8 or nearly 10% for the short 80 Put to be in the money. While such a price decline is possible, it is not "highly probable," especially if Gary's judgment in stock selection and market timing is better than 50-50.

  

Third, Gary must have the discipline to close positions when the market goes against him. If he is "disciplined at taking small losses," then the probability is close to zero that he will experience a maximum loss. For this reason, Gary must not plan to hold a bull put spread to expiration. He must have a plan — stated clearly in advance of making a trade — as to when he intends to take his loss.

  

**Strategic Thinking**

  

Out-of-the-money credit spreads in general, and bull put spreads in particular, are said to have a "high probability of making a small profit, and a small probability of having a large loss." For this reason, Gary and other options traders who are attracted to bull put spreads must do four things: (1) diversify across several stocks, (2) vary the out-of-the-money percentage, (3) use both bull put spreads and bear call spreads and (4) have a clear plan as to when a position will be closed, even if it is closed at a loss.

  

Diversifying across several stocks reduces the average position size and, therefore, reduces the maximum risk of any one spread. While more positions might increase the chances of incurring a maximum loss, the impact of such a loss will be smaller.

  

Using judgment to vary the distance that credit spreads are away from the current stock price, the so-called "out-of-the-money percentage," increases the role of skill and reduces the role of probability. Not only should judgment be used in deciding how far out-of-the-money different spreads should be, judgment should also be used to raise and lower the amount of capital committed to a credit-spread strategy. Sometimes, after all, it is best to stay in cash and await signals from the market before making any trades.

  

Trading both bull put spreads and bear call spreads is another form of diversification. Since a "big price move" can only happen in one direction, having credit spreads on both sides of the market is a technique that reduces risk.

  

Since a maximum potential loss of an out-of-the-money credit spread is several multiples of the potential profit, it is essential to watch the market and to be quick in closing credit spread positions when market action indicates that a spread is in "danger." Such action frequently involves judgment, but hard and fast rules are also necessary to make absolutely certain that large losses are avoided.

  

**Summary**

  

Bull put spreads, whether at-the-money or out-of-the-money, bring in option premium and limit risk at the same time.

  

For an investor who wants to buy stock below the current market price, an at-the-money or close-to-the-money bull spread creates an obligation to buy stock at a price equal to the strike price of the short put less the net premium received.

  

For aggressive traders who seek a "high percentage" monthly income and are suited to take the risk, out-of-the-money bull put spreads offer a high probability of making a profit that may be "small" in dollars but can be "high" in percentage terms. Diversification across stocks, judgment in market timing and stock selection, and discipline in closing positions when the market moves against a position, are key factors in success.

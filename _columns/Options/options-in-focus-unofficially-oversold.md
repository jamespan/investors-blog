With about 90 minutes left in Thursday's session, bulls on the prowl for stronger bargain-hunting opportunities finally have the CBOE Volatility index or VIX acting as contrarian support. Prices in the market's most notorious investor sentiment gauge are up 9.5% and nearing 23.5%. The action extends Wednesday's perky upside breakout above multiple hits of lateral resistance near 20% and the 200-day simple moving average.

  

More importantly, at current levels, the VIX is stretched about 23% above its 10-day simple moving average. As has been discussed prior, that's important as it suggests relative fear on the part of market participants relative to recent prices. As a mean-reverting instrument which will never hit zero like a bankrupt stock or move to "infinity and beyond" like some growth stocks seem to do on occasion. Differentials of 15% or more are important as they typically signal an imminent reversal in investor behavior.

  

With fear finally the order of the day, bulls have a tool, which suggests investor bearishness is likely overdone with a more quantitative approach. There are however, no guarantees as the fall of 2008 can attest too. During that period "the stretch" looked quite silly on occasion as fearful premium expansion in the VIX hit record levels closing in on 90%.

  

Additionally, traders that do fish for bottoms might consider the price action in the VIX is still removed from the historically feared level of 30%. As a rule of thumb based on past incidents, this level lines up nicely with investor panic that's led to more than a few market bottoms. Also, the S&P 500 is still shy by about 0.75% of a full-fledged test of its March Bottom circa 2011 and 200-day simple moving average.

  

In total, conditions are shaping up for stronger bargain-hunting opportunities, but we're not fully there in a perfect world where all systems are a go. As much and for those so daring, remember to use limited risk strategies when entering in "close enough" conditions, leaving some ammo for those times when perfection does strike and a bit more in the coffers for those rarer but even more opportunistic times when bulls wrongly decide to panic with conviction.

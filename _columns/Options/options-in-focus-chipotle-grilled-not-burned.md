What's the price to keep the proverbial portfolio burrito off one's plate? It depends, but one place to start is by looking at a company's option markets for ideas such as marrying an existing stock holding with a put to form a limited-risk synthetic long call. A stock bull could also look to attach a short call if prices look too spicy and establish a collar. This strategy shares the same risk and reward profile of a bull call spread or vertical. 

  

This kind of guaranteed protection versus the use of a stop loss, which may or may not offer a trader the actual safety they seek, came to mind today after recent growth flavor and still quite yummy-to-the-tummy TexMex chain **Chipotle Mexican Grill**  ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) announced a disappointing earnings report which ultimately scorched shares by more than 22% Friday.

  

With earnings uncertainty, especially when shares are high-priced and notoriously volatile around the event like CMG has a history of, investors will need to stomach the cost of pricier-than-otherwise protection if interested in an open-ended reward structure like the married put. 

  

  

Conversely, using a risk reversal spread which sells a call and buys a protective put to create a legged collar against an existing long stock position is going to greatly reduce costly Greeks. However, liquidity, since two options are involved, is going to take a comparatively larger bite out of the spread position when all is said and done. As much, the pros and cons of each strategy should be given their dues before traders decide which might be suitable for portfolios. 

  

Above, we're showing an illustration comparing 100 shares long from 393 versus a bull that then took the time to establish a collar in front of the report using a protective 375 put one strike below aÂ one standard deviation move through August expiration and a 430 strike call to finance the operation. With a very visible but financially livable grilling for the collar versus an outright and overly well-done burn for the long stock position; hopefully the options menu looks like an attractive one to remember going forward, hopefully.

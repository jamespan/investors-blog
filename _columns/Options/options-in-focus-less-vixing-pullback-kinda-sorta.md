What did investors expect? Well, since our last update on the VIX two days ago, readers of this column fully realize the expectation from this option strategist and market soothsayer was for higher prices in the broader market. Doink? You could say we were wrong. Technically, we'd prefer the use of "early" or "premature" as the action, while down, hasn't exactly been terribly detrimental to anyone except headline alarmists looking for eyeballs to read copy. 

  

Truthfully, Tuesday's pullback of 2% in the S&P 500 and today's early cheer-turned-intraday jeer, while a bit spooky at times, has kept to the regularly scheduled program of a confirmed market uptrend, the 10-day simple moving average has acted as support, the "Best Six" calendar period is all but upon us and, and, and....

  

And then there's the VIX, again. After narrowly breaking the historically overly fearful 30% for a second time, the sentiment gauge has only managed to make a less-than-scary move just narrowly above its 10-day simple moving average before reversing back below 30% late in Wednesday's session and remaining in a far from overconfident position and one much more aligned with room for investor improvement. 

  

All told and on an otherwise boring day within a confirmed uptrend (okay, I'm kidding), the fact remains there's plenty of reasons to continue giving the market the benefit of the doubt. Personally, nowhere have I ever read of the market being a straightforward walk in the park, except by hypsters in my spam mailbox. In the end, there's always bears out there as well as the occasional obstacle to get past if you want to move with those follow-through days, which even the good ones, are known to pull a couple tricks in-between the treats.

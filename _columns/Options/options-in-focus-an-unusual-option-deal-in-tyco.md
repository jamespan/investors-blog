**Tyco** ([TYC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TYC)) shares are pausing for a second session after finding bulls' wallets Monday on renewed merger gossip. Buzz has centered on French-based Schneider Electric as a suitor, but execs there have denied any knowledge of discussions with the company. 

  

While we always take rumor mill gossip with a heaping spoonful of salt, shares have continued to hold their own and call activity has also remained favorably lopsided compared to the puts. Net, net the does have us reflecting on those speculations and one two-way spread which may have traded today. 

  

Without looking at the actual prints, but in appreciating some fairly evenly traded contracts on either side of 10,000 in the May 55 and 60 calls, as well as the July 55 and 60 calls and even larger open interest in each; we might surmise a roll from a May vertical into July has taken place. 

  

The difference in cost for the longer-term play which gives the trader (we'll assume a buyer) an additional 56 calendar days to see his or her spread go in-the-money and without assuming adjustment, is roughly $0.40 for a net debit of $1.50 versus May's market price of $1.10 per spread. 

  

Another possibility and mind you this is all conjecture at this point, is that instead of closing out the May bull vertical as part of a roll, a trader sold "to open" May as a bear spread while simultaneously buying July as the bull spread. While it would be considered a more esoteric position, its objectives are quite straightforward, though not altogether linear in what the trader wants. 

  

For the mentioned $0.40 debit, if a trader established this two-way or double vertical (as I'm not sure what to call it), they'd ideally like the May spread to go out worthless. This would leave the trader with the July bull call for $0.40. 

  

The trader would also then like to wake up sometime before July's expiration and read headlines of the Tyco deal going through for something north of $60 a share. Were that to occur, the trader would enjoy a nice sized profit of $4.60 per spread. 

  

And what if the deal came through with May still on the board or just never failed to materialize? In the former scenario the trader would cover the risk of his May bear vertical with the July bull vertical. In the latter situation, both spreads go out worthless. Either way you slice it though, the risk amounts to $0.40 and maybe some food for thought when lots of salt is typically required.

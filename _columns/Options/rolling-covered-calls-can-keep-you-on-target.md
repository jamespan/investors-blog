**Forecasts and Objectives Can Change**

  

Have you ever started out for the grocery store and ended up going to a movie instead? Something similar can happen with a covered call. Imagine that you confidently buy XYZ stock at $53 per share, hoping for it rise modestly and simultaneously sell a 60-day XYZ 55 Call covered call hoping for an attractive static rate of return and possibly an even better if-called rate of return. But then you read an article touting XYZ's long-term growth prospects, and your outlook changes. You now believe that XYZ stock could rise as high at $70.00 in six months. The stock that you initially purchased hoping for a profit of 4-5% in 60 days has now become a possible big mover and a possible long-term holding. What should you do? 

  

This is just one of many examples in which a covered call position, with an initial forecast and an initial objective, encountered some change. Perhaps it is a change in the objective, as in the example. Perhaps the forecast was wrong. Regardless of what has changed, the new situation must be addressed. Should the investor take action? If yes, what should the action be?

  

Introduction to Rolling and Subjective Considerations  
The concept of "rolling" is that the covered call you sold initially is closed out (with a buy-to-close order) and another covered call is sold to replace it. There are many possible reasons for rolling a covered call.

  

Suppose, for example, that the stock price rose above the strike price of the covered call. If you do not want to sell the stock, then you now have greater risk of assignment, because your covered call is now in the money. You therefore might want to buy back that covered call to close out the obligation to sell the stock. At the same time you might sell another call with a higher strike price, which has a smaller chance of being assigned.

  

Alternatively, the stock price could have declined in price. If your intention was to earn income from selling calls, then you could have a loss if the stock price keeps falling. You therefore might want to buy back the covered that has decreased in value and sell another call with a lower strike price that will bring in more option premium and increase the chance of making a net profit.

  

When the stock price does not move as forecast, when the forecast changes or when the objective changes, rolling a covered call is a common strategy. Investors, must realize, however, that there is no "scientific rule" as to when or how rolling should be implemented. Should the existing covered call be closed and replaced with another call? If yes, should the new call have a higher strike price or a later expiration date? There is no "right" or "wrong" answer to such questions. Rolling a covered call is a subjective decision that every investor must make independently.

  

**Rolling up**Rolling up involves buying to close an existing covered call and simultaneously selling another covered call on the same stock and with the same expiration date but with a higher strike price.

  

Here is an example of how rolling up might come about. In the "initial situation" stock XYZ is trading at $79.00 per share, and the investor believed it would trade in a narrow range for the next 60 days. The investor, therefore, initiated a covered write position by buying 100 XYZ shares and selling 1 XYZ October 80 Call. Subsequently, the price of XYZ rose to $83.00, and the investor "rolled up" the October 80 Call to the October 85 Call. There is a net cost for rolling up, but the benefit is a higher potential maximum profit potential. Here are the details.

  

Initial situation: XYZ stock is trading at $79.00  
60 days to October expiration

  

Step 1: Open a covered call position: Buy 100 shares of XYZ stock @ 79.00 per share  
Sell 1 XYZ October 80 Call @ 2.50 per share

  

Comment: This initial covered call position has a maximum profit potential of $3.50 per share and a breakeven stock price of $76.50. The maximum profit potential is calculated by adding the call premium to the strike price and subtracting the purchase price of the stock, or (80.00 + 2.50) — 79.00 = 3.50. The breakeven stock price is calculated by subtracting the call premium from the purchase price of the stock, or 79.00 — 2.50 = 76.50. The initial XYZ covered call position is shown in Graph 1.

  

New situation: XYZ stock is trading at $83.00  
25 days to October expiration  
   
Step 2: Roll up: Buy 1 XYZ October 80 Call @ 4.00 per share  
Sell 1 XYZ October 85 Call @ 2.00 per share  
Net cost per share 2.00

  

Comment: The action involved in "rolling up" has two parts, buying to close the October 80 Call and selling to open an October 85 Call. The new covered call position is "long 100 shares of XYZ and short 1 October 85 Call." The investor is now obligated to sell the XYZ shares at $85 instead of $80 per share. Although this is an increase of $5 per share if the 85 Call is assigned, the net cost of getting this increase in strike price is $2.00 per share.

  

The new maximum profit potential is $6.50 per share and the new breakeven stock price is $78.50. The new maximum profit potential is calculated by adding the original maximum profit to the difference in strike prices minus the net cost of rolling up, or (3.50 + 5.00 — 2.00 = 6.50. The new breakeven stock price is calculated by adding the net cost of rolling up to the original breakeven stock price, or 76.50 + 2.00 = 78.50. The new XYZ covered call position after Step 2 is shown in Graph 2.

  

**Summary**

  

Stock prices do not always cooperate with forecasts. Forecasts or objectives or both can change. As a result, investors who use covered calls should know about basic "rolling" techniques in case they are ever needed. Unfortunately, there is no "right" or "wrong" method of rolling a covered call. The decision to roll is a subjective one that every investor must make individually.

  

"Rolling" a covered call involves a two-part trade in which the covered call sold initially is closed out (with a buy-to-close order) and another covered call is sold to replace it. Rolling up involves buying to close an existing covered call and simultaneously selling another covered call on the same stock and with the same expiration date but with a higher strike price.

  

Rolling up, for a reasonable cost, can enable you to keep a stock you do not want to sell. Alternatively, it can increase net profits on a covered call if you believe the stock price will trade close to or above the strike price of the new call. Rolling up might not always be the appropriate strategy, but you should know the mechanics for those times that you feel it is.

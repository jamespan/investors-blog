NASDAQ 100 and IBD 50 constituent **Alexion Pharmaceuticals**  ([ALXN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALXN)) saw unusually strong option activity Monday. Total volume of roughly 10,500 contracts was well above the biopharmaceutical outfit's 50-day simple moving average of 585, with strong favor for calls over puts by a margin of about 6-to-1.

  

Roughly 65% of today's trading is concentrated in ALXN's surrounding money June 90, 95 and 100 calls. On the surface, the volume would appear to be in sympathy with today's strong bid in shares following news the company is being added to the S&P 500 index at the close of trading on Thursday, May 24, but do realize that's not the only option in town; pardon the pun. 

  

Mostly static implieds in the low to mid 30s and stationed with its two month trading range doesn't confirm overly aggressive buying as being decisively behind ALXN's unusual option action. In fact, in conjunction with premiums that are slightly inflated over statistical range values; traders could be focused on a more moderately bullish position such as the buy-write, which looks to extract income and theta during the life of the contract. With a holiday coming up and only 24 calendar days to boot, this type of positioning is given more credibility. 

  

Also, for would-be bulls viewing the chart a bit too enthusiastically for potential breakouts, we might suggest paying attention to ALXN's open interest relative to volume in those strikes. Existing open interest of 2,500 in the 90s, 2,200 in the 95 strike and just 244 contracts in the 100 call compares to corresponding volume of 2,300, 3,575 and 933. As much, Monday's heaviest trading could be largely tied to existing positions rolling or adjusting. While that type of action certainly can't be faulted, none of it quite adds up to needing to purchase a call to open without extra consideration first.

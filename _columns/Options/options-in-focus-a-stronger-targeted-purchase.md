Buying a stock at a discount to its current market price can sound like an attractive proposition to some traders, whether it's related to buying technical support and / or perhaps having added value on a fundamental basis. 

  

In the world of option trading, the sale of a put when backed up or secured by cash in order to prepare for an actual assignment and take on ownership of shares, is called a targeted purchase and most closely aligns itself with this style of trading. 

  

The potential problem with the targeted purchase is when conditions deteriorate. Cash secured or not, you're still short a put with no guaranteed stop loss until that rare level of 0.00. As much, what once looked like a bright short put / targeted purchase idea can easily turn into something more menacing than anticipated in our portfolio. 

  

The very good news is traders liking this methodology can get a much better handle on their risk by purchasing a lower strike put and establishing a bull put spread rather than a naked, albeit cash-secured put. Traders should also know, the margin requirement for a spread will be far smaller than the outright short and can allow for other bright (and hopefully limited risk) ideas with the extra available capital, should one so chose. 

  

Bottom-line, the credit taken in with the vertical will be smaller than the short put not using protection. But depending on how confident one is of their value bet also means the amount doesn't have to be all that large, if they're okay with assuming additional risk. 

  

In the end, the trader can chose to sell a tight vertical with adjacent strikes or widen the spread to reflect a more confident view. To which, in that other end which sometimes rears its ugly face, you'll undoubtedly be glad you considered the option of spreading before the chart made you wish you had.

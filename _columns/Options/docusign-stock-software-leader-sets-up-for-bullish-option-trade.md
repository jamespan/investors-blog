DocuSign stock has benefited from the new work-from-home environment we find ourselves in these days. **DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) has rallied from a March low around 65 to a high of 230 and currently sits around 208.




Strong stocks pulling back and finding support at their [10-week moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/top-stocks-tend-to-do-this-after-technical-breakout/) is a positive sign and DocuSign stock could be poised for further upside.


IBD assigns DocuSign stock a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 and a Relative Strength Rating of 98, making it one of the top-ranked stocks in the enterprise software group according to [Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-docusign-inc-docu.aspx).


Bullish option traders might consider a bullish butterfly for September expiry.


DocuSign Stock: Butterfly Spread
--------------------------------


A butterfly is a neutral, income-oriented strategy. It is a limited risk and limited profit trade, but on a typical butterfly trade, the profit potential is higher than the potential loss.


Butterfly spreads involve 3 different option strike prices, all within the same expiration date, and can be created using either calls or puts.


By trading a butterfly with a bullish bias we can place the trade cheaply and have a large potential payoff.



Let's take a look at how that might look on DocuSign stock.


Buy 1 September 18 240 call @ 5.40


Sell 2 September 18 250 calls @ 3.75


Buy 1 September 18 260 call @ 2.56

Low Risk/High Reward
--------------------


This trade only costs around $46 per spread but has a payoff potential much higher than that.


The ideal scenario is for DocuSign stock to be right around 250 at expiration on September 18th. You have to get pretty lucky with a trade like this, but sometimes they work out.


The maximum loss on the trade is equal to the premium paid of around $46 per contract. This would occur anywhere below 240 or above 260.

**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) is showing extremely low implied volatility, with an IV percentile of 1%. That means the oil stock's current level of implied volatility is lower than 99% of all other readings in the last 12 months.




That could mean it's a good time to look at positive-vega trade such as a long strangle.


A long strangle is constructed through buying an out-of-the-money call and an out-of-the-money put. The trade aims to make a profit from a big move in either direction by the underlying stock, or from a rise in volatility.


Buying a long strangle is cheaper than a buying a long straddle, but will still suffer from time decay. That means the options will lose a little bit of value with each day that passes if the stock doesn't make a big move.


Oil Stock Trade's Impact From Time Decay
----------------------------------------


With a long strangle, the further out in time the trade is placed, the slower the time decay, but the options are more expensive and require more capital.


For Exxon Mobil, a long strangle could be placed by buying a 130 strike call and a 110 strike put for the Aug. 16 expiration. The call was trading around $0.90 late Tuesday, and the put around $1.40.



When we add the two together, the total cost of the trade would be around $2.30 per contract, or $230.


This is the total amount of risk in the trade and the maximum that could be lost.


The break-even prices are calculated by taking the strike price plus and minus the cost of the strangle.


That gives us break-even prices of 108.60 and 131.40. But profits can be made with a smaller move if the oil stock's move comes earlier in the trade.


For example, the estimated break-even prices in mid-June are around 114 and 125.


Changes to implied volatility will have a big impact on this trade and the interim break-even prices. So it's important to have a solid understanding of volatility before placing a trade like this.


Exit Strategy For Oil Stock Option Trade
----------------------------------------


The ideal scenario is a large move in either direction within the first week or two of the trade.


The worst-case scenario with this Exxon Mobil long strangle would be a stable stock price, which would see the call and put slowly lose value each day. For a long strangle, I usually set a stop loss at around 20% of capital at risk, which would be around $50, and a profit target of around 40%.


I also wouldn't hold the trade any longer than June 30.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-exxonmobil-xom.aspx), Exxon Mobil is ranked No. 7 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 69, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 69 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 67.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Zoom Video Communications** ([ZM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZM)) has been languishing recently, but during that time, implied volatility has fallen off a cliff.




Implied volatility on Zoom stock is around 40%, which is a lot lower than the 100% we saw this time last year.


That means options on Zoom stock are cheap compared with recent history. When that occurs, it's better to be a net buyer of options rather than a [seller](https://www.investors.com/research/options/uber-stock-consolidation-can-still-bring-option-profits/).


Technically, the stock doesn't look great as it trades below the [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and 50-day moving averages, but investors willing to take a contrarian view on the stock could do so in a risk-defined way using an option strategy known as a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade, but also limits the upside.

Going out to May 21 expiration, a 340 strike-price call option was trading around $12.60 and the 350 call was around $9.20.


Buying the 340 call and selling the 350 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $340 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100) and the maximum profit potential would be $660 (the difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


Most Trade Loses Is Premium Paid
--------------------------------


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy. So if Zoom stock closes below 340 on May 21, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $340 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 350. So, no matter how high Zoom stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $660.



Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to Zoom using options.


In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $3.40 to $1.70, or if the stock dropped below 300, I would consider closing early for a loss. Otherwise, I would hold to expiration.


Zoom stock is not showing great ratings so this is definitely a contrarian trade. The [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) is 54, the [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) is 77 and the [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) is 43.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Earnings can be tricky, if you haven't figured that out by now. But with the use of options, rather than stock ownership (or shorting) alone, it is possible to have your cake and eat it too. The way we can do this first and foremost is with limited-risk positions. These can range from the very simple outright long call or long put, to a staple like vertical or maybe onto something more exotic like a ratio backspread or a slingshot strategy. 

  

Market prices or what option traders refer to as implied volatility, your expectations of what you expect the stock to do or not to do, as well as liquidity, should all be reflected upon if you want to come up with what might be considered a better strategy than simply being involved with the stock. 

  

Why bring this message up? Well, in Friday's session the No. 2 ranked IBD 50 component **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) issued a disappointing outlook. What followed was "ARUN" to fill the bullish gap left in the wake of a slightly more endearing results from the prior quarter's earnings report. 

  

With more than 42,000 evenly-traded contracts in ARUN's calls and puts on Thursday hitting the tape and one point wide strike increments; it's good to know that at least a few other traders feel the same way and even if they are on the other side of the bet.

  

  

In the end, if you happened to have gotten dinged a bit more than planned by today's -17.10% finish, then maybe it's time you consider all your options before your next step into a sometimes very mad, money market. 

  

Shown above is a 4x May 32 / 33 call priced using last night's mid quotes. You might not agree with the position itself but hopefully you're agreeable in its ability to keep traders out of harm's way with no bit of luck required and better prepared financially and mentally for the proverbial "Monbacky!" if that's your sort of thing.

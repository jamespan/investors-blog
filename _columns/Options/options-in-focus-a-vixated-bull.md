When it comes to the ups and downs of the broader averages, bulls should cross their fingers that the third time will prove the charm. What's that you say? For bulls watching the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" for clues to future price direction, this appears to be the situation at hand with less than an hour in Tuesday's sessionâ€”and to us, it appears to be a big deal. 

  

Our thoughts, which we first discussed over the weekend in our Weekly Outlook column at Optionetics, is the VIX's third attempt at breaking below 30% should prove to be a key event for bulls, either for the better or worse. That time appears to be now as the market's most notorious sentiment gauge is off about 4.5% and trading near 28.5%. 

  

At sub 30%, Tuesday's price action in the VIX is another stab at moving investor sentiment back towards more historically normalized and less volatile levels after a prolonged period of heightened price gyrations and attached, elevated volatility readings in the likes of the VIX. That said and after two failed attempts, the second being a well-telegraphed overly confident dip, we do see today's technical break as a stronger positive development.

  

  

While we are bullish, we firmly believe if bulls are going to take authoritative control on an intermediate time frame, sentiment can't be allowed to reverse back up above 30% for a third time. To us, that would represent a bit of a strike out situation for bulls typically requiring more confident (but not complacent) sentiment readings in order to enable market prices to move higher in a controlled and constructive manner.

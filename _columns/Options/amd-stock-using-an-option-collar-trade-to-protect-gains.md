After the stock market pullback, I thought it would be a good idea to demonstrate how options can be used to protect profits in a stock position. 




The strategy is called a protective collar and is used to preserve capital while also maintaining some exposure to additional potential gains. 


Another benefit of a collar strategy is that it allows an investor to continue holding a core position that they don't want to sell.


The collar strategy requires an investor who already owns 100 shares of a stock to purchase an out-of-the-money put option and sell an out-of-the-money call option. 


Selling the call finances the purchase of the long put, so this trade can usually be done for little to no cost, and sometimes even for a credit. You can think of it as a covered call with a protective put. 


Let's look at an example.


Setting Up Protective Collar In AMD Stock
-----------------------------------------


Assuming an investor holds 100 shares of **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) stock he or she wants to continue holding, but is worried about a short-term pullback:


* Investor owns 100 shares of AMD stock.
* Sell one February-expiring 150-strike call at $8.45
* Buy one February 125 put at $7.30


By employing this collar strategy, we have limited our losses below 125, and have also generated a credit of $115 (the difference in cost between selling the call and buying the put). 


If we were to buy only the put, it would cost $730. 


Selling the call helps pay for the put, but it also limits the potential gains above 150. 


Placing a collar trade can be a good idea on a stock holding that has appreciated in value. 


For a typical collar trade, you want the sold call to fully cover the cost of the put, but you can adjust the strike prices as you see fit. 


This collar trade has a delta of 30, meaning the new exposure is roughly equivalent to owning 30 shares of AMD stock. So, we have reduced our risk in the position. A 100 share-only position would have a delta of 100. 


AMD Stock Remains A Leader

I hope you enjoyed learning about the collar strategy. And I hope you can use this strategy in the future to protect profits.

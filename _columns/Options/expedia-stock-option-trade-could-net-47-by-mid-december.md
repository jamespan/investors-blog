**Expedia** ([EXPE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EXPE)) [jumped 16% on Friday](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-how-to-handle-market-rally-airbus-apple-nvidia-tesla-moderna-peloton-in-focus/) as the company posted a profit and nearly doubled revenue. EXPE stock cleared a 175.47 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) on strong volume.




The company is ranked No. 4 in IBD's travel booking industry group and is showing a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 71, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 57 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 85. 


Traders who expect strength in Expedia stock to continue could look at a bull put spread option trade. 


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. 


Expedia Stock Option With December Target
-----------------------------------------


Selling the December-expiring, 175-strike price put and buying the 170 put would create a bull put spread. 


This spread was trading on Friday for around $1.60. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $160 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $340. 


That represents a 47% return on risk between now and Dec. 17 if EXPE stock remains above 175. 



If Expedia stock closes below 170 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $340. 


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 173.40, which is calculated as 175 less the 1.60 option premium per contract. 


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 8, which means it is a similar exposure to owning eight shares of Expedia stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves. 


No Earnings Risk For Expedia Stock Trade
----------------------------------------


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1.60 to $3.20, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


With Q3 earnings already released, this trade should have no earnings risk. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) recently closed back above the 21-day and 50-day moving averages and is showing strong accumulation.




Today, I want to look at using options to create a synthetic long stock trade.


A synthetic long stock trade is a way of taking an equivalent long exposure on a stock without having to put up any capital other than the margin requirement. (We'll get to that shortly.)


The strategy is constructed by selling an at-the-money put and buying an at-the-money call.


Let's look at Apple stock as an example.


Assuming investors wanted a bullish exposure via a synthetic long, they could sell a 150 put and buy a 150 call.


Currently, the September 2023-expiry 150 put is trading around $16.20, and the 150 call is trading around $18.50.


Cost Of Synthetic Long $230
---------------------------


Therefore, a September synthetic long stock trade would cost just $2.40 per contract, or $240.


As the name suggests, this is a synthetic long position, and the trader has a similar exposure to owning 100 shares of the underlying. That exposure would cost about $14,800 if the investor bought 100 shares.



So, this is effectively a leveraged position and may not be appropriate for every trader.


Even though the option trade only costs $240, the investor could still lose $15,000 if Apple stock went to $0.


This synthetic long trade produces an equivalent exposure to owning 100 shares for a lower cost.


For this synthetic long position, the margin requirement would be around $4,800. So the investor could use the leverage power of options to trade Apple stock for less.


Leverage May Also Magnify Losses
--------------------------------


Of course, leverage is a double-edged sword, and a falling stock price will magnify losses.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

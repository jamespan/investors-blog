**Tempur Sealy** ([TPX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TPX)) stock was [Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tpx-stock-tempur-sealy-earnings-outlook/) as it broke out to a new high and cleared a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) of 26.05.




Tempur Sealy stock boasts a near-perfect 98 IBD [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). All-time stock winners tend to have Composite Ratings of at least 90 near the start of big runs. Tempur Sealy stock also has an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 81 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 79.


Investors wanting leveraged exposure to Tempur Sealy stock can do so via an option strategy called a long call.


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (the strike price), up until a certain date (the expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage. (This can be both a good and a bad thing.)


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of Tempur Sealy, he or she would have to invest around $2,635 at the current price.


Instead, the investor could gain the same exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option. One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.


Tempur Sealy Option $500 Vs. $2,635 For Shares
----------------------------------------------


If an investor were to buy a single Tempur Sealy call option with a 22.50 strike price expiring in March 2021, that investor would need to invest only around $500 rather than $2,635. If Tempur Sealy stock goes to $0, the investor loses only $500 while still maintaining a similar exposure to the gains.


The Tempur Sealy 22.50 call option gives the investor the right to buy 100 Tempur Sealy shares at 22.50 up until the expiration date.


The call option costs around $5, so the investor would need Tempur Sealy stock to rise above 27.50 (the strike price plus premium paid) to be profitable on the investment.


There is always a risk with trading on leverage like this of course, and if Tempur Sealy drops below 22.50 at expiration, the investor would lose 100% of the investment, which is the $500. An investor holding 100 shares on the other hand would lose at least $385.


Buying a call option is just one of numerous possible option strategies, but it is a very easy one for investors to start with.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment. This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation. Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

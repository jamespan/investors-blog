Markets have been quiet lately, as measured by implied volatility. The Cboe Market Volatility index, or [the VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/), has dropped below 18 in recent days. We have not seen this level since before the coronavirus pandemic.




Most of the trades we've looked at recently — like [this iron condor option trade idea](https://www.investors.com/research/options/twitter-stock-how-to-trade-options-why-an-iron-condor-could-produce-47-percent-return/) and [this long-term option strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/options/long-term-option-trade-idea-on-tilray-stock-offers-62-potential-return/) — will benefit when implied volatility drops or remains low.


Every now and then I like to add in some trades that will benefit when [implied volatility](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) rises.


One way to find potential trade candidates is to look at the implied volatility percentile of a stock. This measures where the current level of implied volatility sits in relation to all readings in the last 12 months.


An implied volatility percentile of 0% means that the current level of implied volatility is the lowest level seen in the last 12 months.


**Walgreens** ([WBA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WBA)) is currently showing an implied volatility percentile of 1%.


That could mean it's a good time to be a buyer of volatility in Walgreens stock.


Walgreens Stock: What A Long Straddle Means
-------------------------------------------


We can do this via a strategy called a long straddle. Construct it through buying an at-the-money call and an-at-the-money put.


Buying at-the-money options can be expensive, and they will also suffer from time decay. This means they will lose a little bit of value with each day that passes if the stock doesn't make a big move.


With a long straddle, the further out in time the trade is placed, the slower the time decay. But the options are more expensive. Plus, they require more capital.


For long straddles I usually go out about three to four months. Then I look to close the trade half way through if the profit target or stop loss have not been hit. This helps to minimize the time decay which gets more severe the closer the trade gets to expiration.



For Walgreens stock, a long straddle could be placed by buying an October 55 strike call and put. The call recently traded around $5.60 and the put around $4.30.


When we add the two together, the total cost of the trade would be around $9.90 per contract or $990. This is the total amount of risk in the trade and the maximum that could be lost.


Break-Even Scenarios
--------------------


The break-even prices are calculated by taking the strike price plus and minus the cost of the straddle.


That gives us break-even prices of 45.10 and 64.90, but profits can be made with a smaller move if the move comes earlier in the trade.


For example, the estimated break-even prices at the end of April are 50 and 59.50.


Changes to implied volatility will have a big impact on this trade and the interim break-even prices, so it's important to have a solid understanding of volatility before placing a trade like this.


The worst-case scenario with this WBA long straddle would be a stable stock price. The call and put would slowly lose value each day. For a long straddle I usually set a stop loss at around 20% of capital at risk which would be around $200.


Walgreens is due to report earnings toward the end of June, and implied volatility is likely to drop after that event.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Following Monday's strong showing in which shares of **Apple**  ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) spiked higher by nearly 3% to record highs and established itself as the largest capitalization company ever, bulls are back for a bit more in Tuesday's first half. Intraday, AAPL rose modestly after broker Jeffries lifted its price target from 800 to 900 and prompting a bit more buying to extend shares about 8.3% past a recent cup-with-handle buy point. 

  

On the option side, volume is once again heavy with nearly 420,000 contracts on the board, although not on pace to surpass yesterday's spike of about 1.27 million calls and puts. Calls are leading over put activity by roughly a 2-to-1 margin. The out-of-the-money August Weeklys 675 and 680 calls are Tuesday's most active with nearly equal volume of about 19,000 apiece, while the near-the-money 670 call is the third most active with 17,500 traded. 

  

With all three easily surpassing open interest figures, fresh opening purchases such as an outright long call position are likely popular with short-term traders. However, given fairly equal volume in each and theta risk for contracts set to expire Friday and made up entirely of time value. Verticals appear to be another simple, but possibly stronger position that's likely attracting interest. 

  

To demonstrate, with shares of AAPL at 667, the August 670 / 675 vertical is trading for $2.00 per spread compared to individual quoted markets of $6.65 for the lower strike 670 and $4.65 for the 675 call. Comparing prices, it's easy to appreciate that for a bull, buying the vertical reduces a good deal of theta risk compared to a long call strategy with either of the two calls. In fact, daily time decay stands at $1.32 for the 670 call, $1.22 for the 675 versus a negligible but building $0.11 for the vertical. 

  

A direct consequence of this pricing feature is an investor purchasing the vertical maintains a breakeven of 672 at expiration. That compares to 676.65 for the 670 call and 679.65 for the 675. Further, the bull call position can expect modest profitability at the breakeven level prior to Friday due to the relationship of the 670 call's intrinsic worth and slightly higher extrinsic value relative to the 675 call which would only maintain the latter. On the other hand, much heavier and still-rising theta risk for the long calls means the clock is ticking considerably harder until proven otherwise. That could occur with some much needed and substantial lifting of premiums from those other Greeks, delta and gamma. Unfortunately, with each passing hour, let alone day, the pair will be increasingly hard-pressed to prove their worth.

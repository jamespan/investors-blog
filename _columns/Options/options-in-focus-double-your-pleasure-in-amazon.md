When there's a large implied volatility spread between calendar months due to an upcoming earnings event, it can be tempting to establish a calendar or even a double calendar. However, before you grow infatuated with a profit range that initially suggests "How can I lose?" take the required defensive step of making sure you're comfortable with those important "What if's" such as a realistic assessment of a volatility crush where it hurts most. Let's examine the latter position with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). 

  

With earnings tonight, Amazon's weekly January options, which will expire tomorrow, are the "pure play" as far as the investor reaction to earnings are concerned. As much and as a stock that's had its share of high profile stock jumps and dumps following its report, implieds ballooned to well-inflated levels near 160%. Tomorrow, prices for better or worse will go to parity or zero, no if's ands or buts' about it. 

  

At the same time with the weekly February contract having just 8 calendar days left in its own cycle, premium there has also found a fairly strong bid prone to a volatility crush in the aftermath of tonightâ€™s release. Shown below and to illustrate, we're looking at a three-lot double calendar spread designed during Thursday's second half.

  

  

For the uninitiated, the profit range does seem to suggest an "I can't lose" proposition when implieds are left static. It would take a very strong move in the magnitude of about 15%, which did occur in fellow IBD 50 constituent **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) today; before this double calendar would start to lose money. 

  

The reality though is going to yield vastly different results, which should have traders at least thinking twice before entering. After fudging with post earnings implieds using my best guesstimate based on historical and implied volatility of the last couple months; I came up with the risk graph below.

  

  

For inquiring minds, I used 40% implied volatility for the February 170 put and 35% in the February 195 call. We might very well be off a bit in our assessment of where implieds will land but the underlying point is the breakevens are much less favorable, our max profit is cut roughly in half and we have something of a less-than-desirable sweet spot if shares were to simply sit still.

Not so long ago, **NVIDIA** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) was seemingly making all the right moves with products like its Tegra 2 chip platform and nothing short of a delicious-looking momentum spurt in its shares to kick off the new calendar year. Several weeks later, the story has turned with items like delays with Intel's Sandy Bridge project impacting prior cheerleading. The stock has since tumbled about 34% from its intermediate highs. 

  

In the here and now and with its corrective action under its belt, is it time for the story to shift gears once more? Maybe, but as we all know there aren't any guarantees in the stock market, except maybe the opening and closing bell at the NYSE. However, with a double-bottom pattern setting up and shares still above the ol' bull line of the longer-term 200-day simple moving average, traders thinking NVDA is a deep pullback candidate may want to look at the May calls. 

  

The May contract will be the front month for NVIDIA's earnings release on May 12 and could act as a beneficial catalyst for shares and maybe a long call strategy. Currently, premiums are at two-plus month lows and fairly priced to even slightly cheap in relation to NVDA's statistical movement. 

  

The June contract, which still has 70 calendar days until expiration, is in a similar position theoretically but with the extra time allowance of 28 days. In combining implied volatility risk that we're willing to live with and giving oneself enough time to see shares rise to the occasion (hopefully), those factors do seem to lend themselves to purchasing a call for a position when we're also directionally bullish. But, let's not fool ourselves entirely either with what we're trying to accomplish.

  

If a trader is purchasing a long call under the guise of premiums being attractively priced and the contract enjoying ample time until another guarantee in the market comes about, then you shouldn't necessarily be so focused on positioning technically with a long delta. In the end, if the position boils down to just owning a long call and nothing else, the impact of delta is most often, bar none, going to be the final arbiter of profit or loss. And if you're not comfortable with that risk, instead, it might behoove you to consider a long strangle or straddle.

**CrowdStrike Holdings** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) is [slightly extended](https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/growth-stocks-weeks-volatility-leaves-crowdstrike-zscaler-in-buy-ranges-global-e-nears-ipo-base/) from a 251.38 entry in an 18-week base. 




CrowdStrike stock shows a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 69, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91 and is sitting above its rising [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), and 200-day moving averages. 


Today, I want to look at a way to use options to limit downside risk for little to no cost. 


The strategy is called a collar trade and involves buying 100 shares of the stock and simultaneously buying an out-of-the-money put and selling an out-of-the-money call. 


The proceeds from selling the call are used to finance the purchase of the protective put. 


Let's look at an example using CRWD stock. 


* Buy 100 shares at 261.79
* Sell one October-expiring 320-strike call at 7.30
* Buy one October 220 put at 7.80


By employing this collar strategy, we have limited our losses below 220, and it has only cost $50 (the difference in cost between selling the call and buying the put). 


If we were to buy only the put, it would cost $780. Selling the call helps pay for the put, but it also limits the potential gains above 320. 



Placing a collar trade can be a good idea on a stock holding that has appreciated in value. 


In this example, assume the CrowdStrike stock was purchased in early June for 220. Using this collar trade will ensure the worst-case scenario results in a scratch trade. 


CrowdStrike Stock Collar Should Cover Cost Of The Put
-----------------------------------------------------


For a typical collar trade, you want the sold call to fully cover the cost of the put, but you can adjust the strike prices as you see fit. 


This collar trade has a delta of 57, so we have reduced our risk in the position. A 100-share position would have a delta of 100. 


I hope you enjoyed learning about the collar strategy and trust you will relish using this strategy in the future. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

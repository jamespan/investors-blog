It would be hard to overlook our timely discussion from yesterday. Not only was our focus on reminding investors with open profits to "remember hedging and protecting gains before it becomes a dicier situation", but the object of our fascination was none other than a technically extended **Apple**  ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). 

  

If you missed it, which if you're an active investor, would be next to impossible, the second half of trade Wednesday saw Apple shares ravaged by a hard-hitting 6% drop from fresh all-time highs. That same action produced a massive bearish engulfing candle on massive volume of 52.4 million that also broke below psychological support of $500. 

  

What hasn't been broken are portfolios which bought protection or used strategies discussed on Tuesday such as a collar or long call, stock substitution position before today's worrisome cattle call of too much grazing at technical altitude became a market thumping reality. 

  

Also not yet broken and looking forward, AAPL's prior year-long up channel connecting its February and September 2011 highs. What was resistance could provide key support for a pullback beyond today's garden or umm, fruit variety profit-taking. By our own non-scientific calculations, that level is around $455 and would represent a healthy corrective move of about 13%.

  

Willing to make an "iPlay" on the downside? The good news and what hasn't changed one iota is Apple's option liquidity remains largely unrivaled and allows for most any type of strategy that might be executed for a fair price, as being possible. Along those lines, an unorthodox bearish risk reversal which uses a limited risk bear call spread combined with either an outright long put or a long bear put spread looks like an interesting idea in conjunction with using maybe yesterday's highs as a stop loss. 

  

We won't get more specific than that, other than saying March would be the contract of choice and if so desired, you could take in one of those much-too-hyped credits. Regardless and based on the hundreds of thousands of contracts traded in the March strikes alone, there's certainly someone willing to take the other side for a reasonably-priced debit.

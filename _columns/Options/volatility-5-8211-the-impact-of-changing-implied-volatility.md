This is the fifth in a series of articles on volatility. The goal of this series is to clarify the different meanings of the term volatility and to discuss its many possible uses, including describing stock price action, evaluating option prices, choosing option strategies, and forecasting the market. Option traders should strive to gain an accurate understanding of volatility — and its many uses — because volatility affects option prices, trading decisions and risk analysis.

  

As discussed in the article last week, implied volatility is the level of volatility that explains the market price of an option. Implied volatility is calculated by taking the five known inputs to the option pricing formula plus the market prices of the call and put, and solving for the level of volatility. Essentially, the options pricing formula is worked in reverse by taking a known output, the option market price, and solving for an unknown input, the level of volatility. Implied volatility makes an option's theoretical value equal to its market price.

  

This article discusses how prices of options — and trading decisions — can be impacted by changes in implied volatility.

  

**Estimating Option Prices**

  

Exhibit 1 illustrates conceptually how option prices change from some "Day 1" when an option position is established to some other "Day 2" when the position is closed.

  

The concept presented in Exhibit 1 is that three inputs change enough to have a meaningful impact on the price of an option, and three inputs do not change. The changing inputs are stock price, days to expiration and implied volatility. The inputs that remain constant or have an insignificant impact if they do change are strike price, interest rate and dividends. The impact of changing interest rate is minimal, and dividend changes are generally announced in advance.

  

Now consider some market forecasts in which an option trader is considering the purchase of a call option in an effort to profit from a bullish stock price forecast. Exhibits 2, 3 and 4 illustrate how different forecasts lead to the selection of different options.

  

On Day 1 in Exhibit 2, under "Initial Inputs," the stock price is $73, there are 35 days to expiration, and the implied volatility is 30%. Given these assumptions plus an interest rate of 1% and no dividends, the values of the 75-strike Call, the 80-strike Call and the 85-strike Call are 1.88, 0.62 and 0.16, respectively.

  

The Day 2 column in Exhibit 2 shows the results of a forecast calling for a stock price rise to $79 at 28 days to expiration (7 calendar days have passed) and implied volatility unchanged at 30%. Under the "New Outputs," we see that the 75 Call has increased to 5.08 for a 170% increase. The 80 Call has increased to 2.19 for a 253% increase, and the 85 Call has increased to 0.72 for a 350% increase.

  

Given these results, the 85-strike Call has the highest percentage price increase. As a result, the first choice for a trader with approximately $500 to invest and risk would be to buy 31 of the 85-strike Calls for $496 (31 x $16). Buying 8 of the 80-strike calls for $496 (8 x $62), and buying 3 of the 75-strike Calls for $564 (3 x $188) would both return a lower percentage profit on approximately the same amount of capital invested. 

  

Exhibit 3 shows the results of a different forecast in which the same stock price rise to $79 takes more time. In Exhibit 3, the Day 2 column shows 14 days to expiration (21 calendar days have passed) and implied volatility unchanged at 30%. Under the "New Outputs," we see that the 75 Call has increased to 4.49 for a 139% increase. The 80 Call has increased to 1.42 for a 129% increase, and the 85 Call has increased to 0.25 for a 56% increase.

  

Given these results, the 75-strike Call has the highest percentage price increase and would be the first choice. Under this scenario, buying 3 of the 75-strike Calls would yield a higher profit than buying 8 of the 80-strike calls or buying 31 of the 75-strike Calls.

  

Exhibit 4 shows the results of a third forecast in which the stock price rises to $79 at 28 days to expiration, but the level of implied volatility has declined from 30% to 20%. In Exhibit 4, the Day 2 column shows 28 days to expiration (7 calendar days have passed) and implied volatility at 20%. Under the "New Outputs," we see that the 75 Call has increased to 4.45 for a 136% increase. The 80 Call has increased to 1.33 for a 114% increase, and the 85 Call has increased to 0.20 for a 25% increase.

  

In this scenario, the 75-strike Call is again the first choice for a trader with approximately $500 to invest. Buying 3 of the 75-strike Calls would again be more profitable than buying 8 of the 80-strike calls or buying 31 of the 85-strike Calls.

  

**Comparing the Impact of Time and Decreasing Implied Volatility**  
   
A comparison of Exhibits 3 and 4 shows that a decrease in implied volatility from 30% to 20% (Exhibit 4) has nearly the same impact on option prices as two weeks of time erosion (Exhibit 3). In both exhibits, the options prices decreased significantly, and the "1st choice" for a trader switched from the out-of-the-money 85-strike Call to the close-to-the-money 75-strike call.

  

This observation — that decreasing implied volatility can change a trader's first choice of options — is especially important for traders who buy options to trade earnings reports. It is around earnings reports that implied volatility can change dramatically as traders take positions in an effort to profit from their predictions.

  

Next week's article explores how implied volatility can change around earnings reports and how options traders might protect themselves from adverse changes.

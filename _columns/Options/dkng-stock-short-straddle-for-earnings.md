It's been a big couple of weeks on the earnings calendar and we've had quite a few successful ideas like [this one](https://www.investors.com/research/options/roku-stock-bull-put-spread-can-exploit-volatility/) on **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) stock and [this one](https://www.investors.com/research/options/amzn-stock-bull-put-spread-looks-capture-volatility-premium/) on **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) stock.




While it can be a risky time for option traders, there is also a lot of opportunity.


One popular trade among option traders is a short straddle that is held over the earnings announcement. This is a risky trade because it involves the sale of naked options, so it is not recommended for beginners.


The losses are potentially unlimited so always keep that in mind.


**Draft Kings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) reports earnings on Friday morning, so let's take a look at a short straddle using the Feb. 26 expiration.


To set up a short straddle, traders would sell the at-the-money call and the at-the-money put.


DKNG stock closed at $60.31 on Wednesday, so the at-the-money strike would be at $60.



At the close of trade yesterday, the $60 call was trading around $2.85 and the $60 put was trading for $2.50. Selling these two options would generate $535 in premium with break-even points at $54.65 and $65.35.


The Short Straddle For DKNG Stock Over Earnings
-----------------------------------------------


Market makers set option prices based on an expected move over the life of an option. Currently the implied move for DKNG stock over earnings is around 8.87%. This is calculated as the premium of $5.35 divided by the stock price of $60.31.


It also means the stock can move up or down by 8.87% before the trade starts to suffer losses. After Draft Kings's last earnings announcement, the stock moved plus-3.9%.


There's no guarantee of course that the stock will stay within the expected move again this time.


Implied volatility is currently trading at 137% for the Feb. 26 options, much higher than the regular level seen for DKNG stock. In part this is because of the earnings announcement as there is always a lot of uncertainty around how the numbers will come out.


Will DKNG stock stay within the expected move of 8.87% or will the move be bigger than that?


If the move is less than 8.87% the straddle sellers win. If the move is more than that, the straddle buyers win. Selling straddles over earnings is a popular strategy for option traders, however trading naked options is very risky.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

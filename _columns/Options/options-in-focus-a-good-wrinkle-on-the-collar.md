Many longer-term traders that use options directionally enjoy the collar strategy. The long stock position combines an equivalent ratio of long at or out-of-the money puts for protection and a similar amount of short calls one or more strikes above the put for financing purposes. 

  

The design of the collar limits the upside potential but the use of adjustments during a favorable run higher can allow the trader to increase his or her max return while also vastly improving upon its limited downside risk. Further, many investors will use the collar to accumulate shares after a corrective move. This can be accomplished by re-working or adjusting the collar around current prices in the event shares of a determined long-term holding move into a perceived value situation. 

  

Also and maybe not completely obvious, there is more than one way to initiate this flexible strategy. One popular method is to use a risk equivalent bull-put spread positioned at or out-of-the money. In using the bull put spread as an entry into the collar the trader opens up the possibility of acquiring long stock below current prices if assigned on the higher strike short put. If that doesn't sound like good news, it's actually in keeping with the actions touched upon above wherein traders use the collar to accumulate stock after a corrective move. 

  

Much like with a collar position which finds shares dropping after being established, if the outlook of the bull put spread strategist grows less convinced buying shares on weakness is appropriate or a good idea, there's nothing to stop the trader from simply exiting the position. While the trader could be facing some sort of limited loss, there could be a profit as well. Despite the trader's more bearish opinion, if shares aren't too far below the upper sold strike of the vertical and some time has passed, the spread may have collected time decay leading to actual profits.

  

  

Ultimately, the vertical can be closed in its entirety prior to an assignment or even after the fact. Further and regardless of changed technical forecasts, the trader can rest more comfortably knowing the max risk at stake is the same dollar amount accepted initially when having the full faith and confidence of a bull seemed like a good idea. 

  

Shown above and to illustrate is a 3 x **SPDR Gold Trust ETF** ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) October 164 / 161 put bull vertical. Of course we can't say it's a golden opportunity. However, with superior liquidity provision and less than 4% risk guaranteed, even if shares opt to move more than one standard deviation away from what appears to be a strengthening technical situation, it's the kind of wrinkle we sometimes like on our collars.

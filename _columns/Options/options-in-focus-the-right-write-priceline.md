With the broader market reversing in late Friday trade, the price has become slightly less profitable but still very much on the right side of the action for short premium holders in **Priceline.com** ([PLCN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLCN)). Late in yesterday's session we discussed the Internet travel behemoth's well-bid weeklys April 535 / 540 strangle and mused its attractive-looking compensation relative to risk in front of its earnings report. 

  

  

What could possibly go wrong? Well, not too much now even though an actual repeat of last year's Flash Crash would, if we were to give a reasonable estimate, would prove fatal to profits which "only" have another approximate 5% of room before traders on the "write" side of the trade would breakeven. 

  

The other reality is any short strangles entering the session actually enjoyed profits of $29 to $30 per contract out-the-gate as shares opened and wiggled around the unchanged mark during the first half hour. As much, I'd like to give them "credit" for being on both the "write" side of the trade, as well as having done the right thing as the day progressed.

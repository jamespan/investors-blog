The **iShares Silver Trust ETF** ([SLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLV)) has quickly become a great lesson in what goes up in a persistent and tenacious march is also likely to face unseemly profit-taking when bulls try to collectively "schnitzel a little" at the same time. Since pushing and prodding its way higher to multidecade highs over the last few weeks while finding "trendy" support from the short-term 10-day simple moving average, shares of SLV have collapsed roughly 20% in three hard hitting sessions of fierce exiting. 

  

With Wednesday's lows testing the 50-day simple moving average, bulls maybe recently wishing for such an opportunity to buy the longer-term support line are facing that reality. But of those riding the uptrend of recent days and weeks, how many are really in a position to "Monbacky!!??" 

  

The last I checked, most traders actually have limited financial resources rather than a never-ending reservoir of funds with which to can accumulate more shares when conditions present a potential value play but at the same time prove unnerving and maybe damaging to one's existing holdings. 

  

Based on the aggressive nature of SLV's quick collapse, we're estimating the majority of bulls were ill-prepared for this type of price move and aren't in position to add on weakness without drastically increasing their risk. That said, certain option strategies, if deployed prior, could be taking advantage of the dizzying price collapse without adding undue risk as the proverbial blood in the Street is still flowing. 

  

I'm not suggesting it's for everyone, but strategies like dynamic collars or a married put are two positions which keep losses well-contained and bulls in position to "Buy, Buy, Buy!!" when profit-taking gets maybe a bit too aggressive. In the case of Silver, the near 20% pullback from highs means a trader using one of these strategies could be in position to accumulate or increase their long stock holding by up to 20% by funding the venture with the profitable proceeds from the bearish option portion of his or her holdings. 

  

Remember though, this type of reality isn't really about "Buy, Buy, Buy!!" but more akin to "Buy, Buy and Sell!!" In the end, this type trader is looking to buy stock, buy an equal amount of protective puts and maybe sell the same number of calls to finance this smarter road to riches; where less attention is paid to fickle price charts and more on bullet proof risk graphs.

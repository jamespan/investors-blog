Late in the session, IBD 50 constituent **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) is in the top spot for unusual option volume on a seven-fold increase over its daily average with volume topping 6,700 contracts in front of tonight's earnings report. Calls and puts are evenly matched with a put/call ratio of 1.09. 

  

Most active on the board and not entirely surprising, September is seeing most all of today's interest. With 15 calendar days left there's a bit more than two trading weeks for those calls and puts to play out before they're either stock equivalents or fully worthless. 

  

Also keeping September the only game in town for most of today's traders is Ulta's existing blemish of less-than-hot option liquidity. The unfortunate reality is individual quoted markets of about $0.30 in the surrounding money September calls and puts doesn't get any more attractive in further out maturities. As much, spread orders, even simple ones with just two legs such as verticals or straddles become all the more dicey due to likely slippage in opening and possibly the closing of positions.

  

  

Implied volatility is bid and continuing its spike toward the high 60's. That type of demand for protective premium is very much on par with recent past quarterly reports as illustrated above and denoted by the "E" wedged inside the green triangle on the chart. 

  

Related, the expected move based on the at-the-money straddle market's implied volatility of about 67% suggests traders see a one standard deviation or 68% chance shares will be contained within 13.5% of Thursday's price near 95.50 through expiration.

  

At the same time, with statistical or underlying stock volatility mostly in the lower quartile of its yearly range (not shown) and tonight's uncertainty to be reflected in the share price tomorrow, for better or worse, we'd estimate September premiums could get cut down by about 50% towards 35% to 40% IV. Hmm, I guess you could say there are some crazy option highlights in which customers of ULTA's calls and puts, hopefully considered ahead of time.

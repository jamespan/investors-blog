A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price. In today's example, we'll look at a calendar spread trade for Goldman Sachs stock.




Calendar spreads are usually done with monthly options, but they can also be used with weekly options.


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they would use puts.


Goldman Sachs Stock: Calendar Spread
------------------------------------


With **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) trading around 220, setting up a calendar spread at 220 gives the trade a neutral outlook.


Selling the December 18 220 call option for Goldman Sacks stock will generate around $700 in premium. Buying the January 15 220 call will cost around $1,010.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $310 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is $450 but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if Goldman Sachs stock remains around 220 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay at a faster rate than the bought option allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


The breakeven prices for the trade are estimated at around 209 and 232. But these can also change slightly depending on the impact of changes in implied volatility.


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


Profit Target/Stop Loss
-----------------------


For a trade like this I would set a profit target of 20%. I would set a stop loss if Goldman Sachs stock breaks through either 209 or 232.



For a trade like this I would risk not more than 2% to 3% of my capital.


Goldman Sachs' Q4 earnings report is due in January, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

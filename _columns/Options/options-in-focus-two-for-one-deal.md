For those stock traders holding onto the occasional paper loss, did you know there's a strategy with options that requires no cost to establish but can potentially yield double the returns of a naked long stock position, if there's a rebound in share price? For more than a few knowledgeable option traders the trade is known as a double long position. 

  

The double long is comprised of a call ratio front-spread in which the trader buys a lower strike and sells two higher strike calls against every 100 shares of long stock already held. One way to look at this strategy is to think of it as a combined buy-write and bull call spread. The key to doubling one's return with this strategy isn't hard to do. In fact, all that's required is for the trader to locate a 1 x (2) ratio that can be executed for no money, a "close enough for government work" tiny debit or better yet, a small credit. 

  

What might make this position attractive to some bulls looking to own or already "long and wrong" is the long shares plus the 1 x -2 ratio spread means there's no short call contract risk above the sold higher strike. Remember or realize this, long stock is a synthetic long call / short put. Hence, the trader maintains two long calls against a short call hedge of two contracts. 

  

In saying all the above, the magic with "the double" should now be less mysterious as to how and why it works. Instead of a simple long stock position the double long position is, as already noted, a buy-write and bull call spread for no extra cost. This means up to the strike sold the trader maintains the benefit of doubling his or her return as the bull call vertical widens to its max profit potential, while also producing matching gains in the underlying shares, which would have been owned regardless of the option spread. 

  

The downside of this option-and-stock strategy is two-fold. First, there is actual downside risk involved with owning long stock and which the trader will have to accept and / or look to manage under potentially adverse conditions. As for the ratio spread itself, if shares should move lower a likely worse case would require the trader to buy back the position for a small debit prior to expiration. While the spread would eventually go out worthless below the purchased strike, it could present margin issues or simply pose too much risk for traders to bear in the interim. 

  

The second risk or maybe dilemma some bullish traders face is that while the "double long" does double one's profit pleasure up to the sold strike, but beyond that the gains are capped. Again, the position is the same as a buy-write and bull call vertical combined. As much, remember or realize both these spreads outperform shares in flat or moderately bullish environments but will make traders feel the pain of lost potential profits on those occasions when a stock pulls off a more headline-worthy move.

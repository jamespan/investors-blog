Recent IPO, potential growth outfit and niche, luxury men's retail label **Michael Kors** ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)) came in with all-around strong results this morning. But despite beating on both its top and bottom-lines and issuing upside, above-views FY13 guidance, investors saw fit to back away from an out-the-gate gap test of its 50-day simple moving average and move shares from a high near 42.75 to an intraday level of about 40 a share. 

  

For longer-term investors seeing today's report as an opportunity to get long KORS with a good deal of company-specific uncertainty now removed, but respecting the inability of shares to get above their 50-day simple moving average within its weekly base; a collar using call and put options, might be a smart way to accessorize the position. 

  

The collar strategy buys stock, sells an "at" or out-of-the-money call and purchases a put for downside protection on a one-to-one basis. While the position is generally considered a moderately bullish one, the placement of strikes is what ultimately determines the risk and reward involved and how much movement in the underlying shares will be required to realize either of those amounts.

  

  

To illustrate a collar and one which looks interesting given what's occurring in the stock today, we've set up a 3x collar using the July 37 put and July 42 call for a net cost of $40.29 per spread. The component prices used to establish the debit are $40.04 for long stock, $2.00 call sale and $1.75 purchase price for the put. Thus, the option "risk reversal" costs $0.25 per spread which is added to the price paid for shares.

  

This particular collar is uneven, meaning the sold call and protective put aren't equidistant to the share price and the position maintains a bit more downside exposure versus its potential upside gain. However, adjustments might be possible down the road, given the right opportunity. In the end, the collar is a limited risk and limited reward position. But prior to expiration it's best not to cling to the notion a collar is a static spread; rather, see it as being potentially electric or dynamic and open to new designs that better fit the times.

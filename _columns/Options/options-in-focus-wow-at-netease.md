According to some recent commentary on Investors.com, some are ever hopeful "the games don't stop" for Chinese online game developer **NetEase.com**  ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)). The outfit licenses **Activision Blizzard's** ([ATVI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ATVI)) wildly popular "World of Warcraft" video game and could land the exclusive rights to Activision's "Call of Duty" franchise as well. 

  

On another battlefield though, bulls are still behind enemy lines technically. Shares of NTES climbed a healthy 3.25% today to jump above its 50-day simple moving average but are now testing overhead resistance from its longer-term 200-day average, as well as a facing a recent "Death Cross." 

  

The good news for hopeful bulls is shares of NTES could be shaping a reset base count with the seven months representing a first stage slightly quirky, double-bottom weekly base. The bad news is that same formation likely has bears taking offense to that optimism and maybe unwilling to back away from a notorious series of lower highs and lows i.e. a weekly downtrend. 

  

The somewhat better news, whether you're with the axis' of good and evil i.e. bulls or bears; options in NetEase.com are available. Admittedly, liquidity is a bit loose and not worthy of simply raising the white flag over and surrendering too. However, on a day such as today when conditions are friendly to a certain directional camp of stock traders; making sure the resistance doesn't sneak up on you overnight can definitely be better defended against with the likes of legged married put or collar.

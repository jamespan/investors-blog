The last time we spoke about **VMWare** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)), it was in defense of a slightly controversial base count. Back on October 19 a first stage double bottom pattern which looked to be staging a breakout was discussed, along with some option strategizing. 

  

Unfortunately and as we pointed out, due to the timing of the bullish action in shares, our first choice for a play, an OTM long call, was less approachable as December wasn't yet on the board and November was just entering its theta heavy, final 30 calendar days where time decay increases for that type option. 

  

If it turns out you were "slightly slower" than that day's ultra fast money operators, you may be in luck or at least have the opportunity to look at an even more qualified base in-the-making, as well as the use of December options for positioning.

  

  

With earnings out of the way and implied volatility having declined further, the use of an out-of-the money call, remains a favored choice. Shown above, is a three-lot position of December 105 calls. Priced for $3.10 per contract, the risk on a model $20K portfolio is wedged between 4% and 5% in the event no action is taken during the life of the position and shares remain below 105. 

  

With a light volume tease of the handle's pivot high of 100.45 on Thursday and slightly lower close, in order to double the premium this bull will need VMW to move higher by 11% come expiration. That seems approachable given VMW's price history. And with 42 calendar days still left until expiration, a swifter move through the buy point, healthy volume or otherwise, will allow for even quicker identical profits to materialize.

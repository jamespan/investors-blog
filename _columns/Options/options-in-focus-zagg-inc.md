One name showing a bit more zig and "zagg" than most Monday were shares of **Zagg Inc**  ([ZAGG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZAGG)). The mobile device accessory outfit easily topped views this morning and raised its sales outlook for FY11 above forecasts. With shares of ZAGG up about 7.50%, the stock appears to be staging a breakout to all-time-highs from a slightly-flawed high level double bottom base seven weeks in length. 

  

On the option side, trading has been brisk and reflective of Monday's enthusiasm by shareholders, but not obscenely so determined as to be over-the-top. Compared to a daily average of about 5,000 contracts, roughly 17,000 calls and puts have traded with the former favored by a two-to-one margin with a bit of time still on the clock. 

  

Interested bulls wishing to use Zagg's option market for leverage and / or implement strategies not possible with stock alone, do need to be aware of a couple flaws in its pricing and potential hazards related to option strategies. For one, despite the overall attractive sounding liquidity provision, the use of spreads beyond the front couple months looks prohibitive. And even there, individual markets are spotty enough as to realize slippage can be an issue in both trying to enter and in exiting positions. 

  

Secondly and related, as a lower capitalization stock with potentially big growth but one not immune to naysayers as evidenced by its short interest of 50%, puts are skewed higher relative to calls as shares appear potentially hard-to-borrow. Not only does this distort traditional arbitrage relationships such as conversion / reversal markets, but even a strategy like a long call calendar maintains extra risk. 

  

In this type situation there's the possibility of being assigned on the short near-term call with little or no advance notice to close down the position first. The problem is when the stock can't be located for borrowing, other unwanted actions like exercising one's long contract prematurely in order to cover short stock risk is a potential hazard which ultimately, could have been avoided with a little attention to detail and understanding that type situation intimately like a pro would.

**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) looked like a stock that was going to stay put for a while last week. On Sept. 22, this column looked at an [iron condor trade in Adobe stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/adobe-stock-how-this-option-trade-in-adobe-can-produce-return/). Let's check in and see how the trade is working out.




Adobe Stock Iron Condor: Then And Now
-------------------------------------


At the time of the Sept. 22 article, ADBE stock was trading around 480. Now it's hanging around 500.


Recall that our iron condor setup used two [vertical spreads](https://www.investors.com/research/options/dbx-stock-analyzing-bullish-option-trade/). The 430 — 420 bull put spread traded around $1.40 and the 520 — 530 bear call spread traded around $1.60. That put the total premium received at $3.


As of yesterday, Adobe stock finished around 490. The put spread dropped in value to 40 cents and the call spread was up slightly to $1.75.


The combined total of $2.15 was less than the initial $3 premium received. That put the trade at 85 cents profit per share per contract and a return on risk of 12.14% in just over a week's time.


Trading today has eroded profits further as the call spread increased in value.


Below you will find a full breakdown of how the trade progressed.

What To Do Now
--------------


Remember, with the iron condor, you don't want the stock to go up too much or down too much. Right now, the risk seems to be more on the upside. In fact, an earlier column this week laid out a bullish option trade to take advantage of a move in [Adobe stock with a long call option strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/options/adobe-stock-using-long-call-option-strategy-to-gain-leveraged-exposure/).


If Adobe stock moves above 523 by expiration, it will knock you out of the profit zone. The loss on the bear call spread will be more than your profits on the bull put spread.


It might make sense to take profits or adjust. When you adjust your outlook on what a stock may do, you may need to make an adjustment to the option trade as well. We've also had a [change in market outlook.](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-gives-bullish-signal/)


A couple of simple adjusting strategies include rolling the call spread further out or delta hedging with shares.


Don't worry if that doesn't make any sense just yet. Adjusting is an advanced topic which we will cover in more detail in future columns.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

This week, we've looked at a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/roku-stock-bull-put-spread-can-exploit-volatility/) on **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) and a [bear call spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/unh-stock-bear-spread-has-wide-profit-range/) on **United Health** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)), but today I want to analyze a cash secured put on **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) stock.




AMD stock is highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96 and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 98 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 59.


Technically, the stock looks a bit weak right now but could be looked at as a bargain, being 10.67% below the high set in January.


What I am looking to do is sell a March cash-secured put with a strike price of 80. But first I'll wait to see if the stock price drops a little further in the short-term.


A cash-secured put involves selling an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock at the strike price.


AMD Stock Cash-Secured Put Can Profit in Two Ways
-------------------------------------------------



The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to take assignment and acquire the stock below the current price.


The March 80 strike put for AMD stock was trading around $1.40 yesterday. I would love to see the stock drop a bit more in order for that option to be priced around $2.50.


If I'm able to sell that put for $2.50 that would mean a potential return of $250. There is $7,750 at risk (strike price minus premium received times 100), but only if AMD stock falls to 0.


That represents a potential 3.23% return in one month provided AMD stock stays above 80.


With markets looking a little shaky, it makes sense to stick with a [standard CAN SLIM stop loss of 7%-8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


With the trade risking $7,750 that equates to $540 - $620, so if losses reach that level, I would close the trade.


Let's see what the next few days bring for AMD stock.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

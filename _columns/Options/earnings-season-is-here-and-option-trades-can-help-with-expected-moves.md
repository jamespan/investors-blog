Earnings season kicks into gear this week with some big names reporting. How can we profit with option trades?




Among the marquee names reporting this week, we have **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) and **Charles Schwab** ([SCHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SCHW)) that reported this morning. On Wednesday, **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)), **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)), **United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) and **Procter & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) report. Thursday has **American Airlines** ([AAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAL)) and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) on tap. Finally, **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) and **Ally Financial** ([ALLY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ALLY)) report on Friday.


It's shaping up to be a busy week.


Calculating Expected Stock Moves With Options
---------------------------------------------


Those who are wondering what sort of stock moves we might see can use the options market to gain an insight into the market expectation.


So what can option trades tell us about the move in stocks?


We can use what is called the expected move. This tells us the market's expected range for an underlying stock for a specific period.


The quickest way to work out the expected move is to look up the price of a straddle option trade for the first expiry date after the earnings date. Simply add together the price of the at-the-money put option and the at-the-money call option.


While this approach isn't as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate.


Let's take a look at the expected moves for these stocks this week:


Tuesday Earnings
----------------


GS: – 3.7%


SCHW: – 3.4%


You can see that Goldman Sachs stock moved outside of its expected move with its drop of more than 6% today, while Charles Schwab moved lower but rebounded a bit. It's just outside of the expected move. The option trades give you an idea of the expectation, but that doesn't always translate to reality.


Wednesday
---------


BAC: – 3.5%


MS: – 4.0%


UAL: – 5.5%


PG: – 2.5%


Thursday
--------


AAL: – 5.9%


NFLX: – 7.4%


Friday
------


SLB: – 4.7%


ALLY: – 4.3%


It's important to note that these expected moves based on the option trades can be in either direction.


Using Expected Moves For Option Trades
--------------------------------------


Option traders can use these expected moves in option trades to structure a few different strategies. Bearish traders can look at selling bear call spreads outside the expected range.


Bullish traders can sell bull put spreads outside the expected range or look at naked puts for those with a higher risk tolerance.


Neutral traders can look at iron condors. For iron condors, it is best to keep the short strikes outside the expected range.


When trading options over earnings, it is best to stick to risk-defined strategies and keep the position size small. If the stock makes a larger-than-expected move and the trade suffers a full loss, it should not have more than a 1-3% effect on your portfolio.


Good luck this week, traders.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

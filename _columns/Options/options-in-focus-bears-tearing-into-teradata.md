Option traders are busy Wednesday in IBD 50 component **Teradata** ([TDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDC)) in front of tomorrow morning's earnings release. With about an hour left in the session, volume in the enterprise data provider's options swelled nearly ten-fold to more than 4,000 contracts with investor's fancying puts by a strong 4.5-to-1.0 margin. 

  

In conjunction with ballooning August implieds setting a fresh three month high of 55% compared to range activity mostly in the 30s to low 40s, we can make a more educated guess of buyers looking for either protection or placing speculative downside bets as being behind the order flow. 

  

Checking the board, the lopsided action only intensifies as roughly 75% of Wednesday's option activity is concentrated in the out-of-the-money August 60 put. With less than 250 contracts residing in the strike, volume in excess of 3,000 appears to making the wager of shares moving aggressively lower following the company's report. 

  

In truth, the trading could also represent a protective hedge. However, with literally hundreds of smaller prints on the session and just one block-sized print amongst the 3,000 or so traded; the likelihood of the action representing naked long put bets increases dramatically. The reason is its highly doubtful this type of continuous order flow is part of a more elaborate (but still simple) spread such as a married put which incorporates long stock with the put purchase. 

  

The word "aggressively" in describing today's most active contract shouldn't be overlooked. The fact is while we don't know how investors will react in shares of TDC tomorrow, we can anticipate with much greater authority that option premiums are very likely to come under pressure and revert back towards their short-term mean of recent weeks and months. 

  

All else being equal, if shares were to open unchanged, the put which remains out of the money by about 10% and currently priced for $1.15 is likely to be trading for $0.45 to $0.55 per contract. That's based on the contract's vega per point of 0.04and an estimated drop in implieds from about 63% to 48%, give or take a point or two on either side.

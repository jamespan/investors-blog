The last time I discussed **Trina Solar** ([TSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSL)) back on February 22, I was admittedly hot on the stock's technical prospects after eyeing a large 13-month inverse head and shoulder pattern on the weekly chart. At the same time, IBD was looking to "handle" things slightly different with a proper buy point of 29.99 coming under quick pressure within a smaller cup-shaped base. 

  

For stock traders using traditional stop losses of 7% to 8% below the handle buy point, the choice turned out to be a good one thus far as shares fell a full 2.50 points or 9% below an 8% stop of 27.59 at Friday's lows of 24.

  

Looking at the bigger and former picture presented by this strategist, it turns out the weekly inverse head and shoulder formation has continued to hold, albeit a bit sloppily and "complex" at this point. Right shoulder lows of 22.05 remain far removed from even Friday's lows and intact. 

  

The other truth of course is to have held stock since the February 22 high requires a large bit of risk taking on a percentage basis for any would-be shareholders. Or does it? Actually, that depends if those same bulls use options in conjunction with the stock purchase. 

  

Without giving away the family ranch, one position that could be showing a much lesser and controlled loss of about -3% is a very dynamic kind of collar. The loss compares to the -13% profit drain still facing a shareholder holding from the 30 level despite Monday's pop in excess of 7% in shares. What's more, this type option position is poised to begin accruing profits near current levels of 26. 

  

Don't get it? Well, this more fluid type of long stock, short call and long put position does take some education to learn the more dynamic part, which makes it so interesting. However, in one trader's opinion, it's far from costly compared to that other notorious kind given at the school of hard knocks and in those often enough, mad money markets.

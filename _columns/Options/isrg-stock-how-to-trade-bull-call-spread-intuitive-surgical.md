**Intuitive Surgical** ([ISRG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ISRG)) [cleared an early entry](https://www.investors.com/news/idexx-stock-intuitive-surgical-stock-top-early-buy-points/) of 781.99 on Friday from a [handle-like formation](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-spot-traits-of-proper-handles-on-cup-patterns/).




ISRG stock is holding nicely above a rising [21-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and the 50-day moving average with a Composite Rating of 78, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 62 and a Relative Strength Rating of 75.


For a bullish trade, we would typically like to see [stronger IBD ratings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/), but the technical picture looks quite strong.


Intuitive is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 21. So, if the stock continues to rally up until that date, bullish option trades should do well.


A bull call spread is an easy, risk-defined strategy that will benefit from further upside in the stock. You can create it through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade, but it also limits the upside.


ISRG Stock: Trading The Bull Call Spread
----------------------------------------


Going out to February expiration, a 790-strike call option, which is out of the money, was trading on Friday around $43.95. An 800-strike call expiring on Feb. 19 traded around $39.30 per contract.


Buying the 790 call and selling the 800 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $465 (difference in the two above option prices multiplied by 100.


So, you would see the maximum profit potential at $535 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy, so if ISRG stock closes below 790 on Feb. 19, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $465 premium paid.


Why The Total Profit Is Capped
------------------------------



Potential gains are also capped above 800, so no matter how high ISRG stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $535.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to ISRG stock using options.


In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $4.65 to $2.30, I would consider closing early for a loss. Otherwise, I would hold to expiry.


An Additional Option Risk
-------------------------


Meanwhile, also consider that the bid-ask spreads are quite high on ISRG options. Thus, it may be difficult to get filled at a good price.


Always remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

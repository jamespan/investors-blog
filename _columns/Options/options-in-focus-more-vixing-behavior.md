  Options In Focus: More VIX'ing Behavior?

Despite very flattish and tight conditions entering the final half hour of trade on Monday in the S&P 500, the CBOE Volatility Index has staged a very decisive move in shedding nearly 11% to a reading below 19%. What's more baffling is the confident behavior in the market's most notorious sentiment index is signaling short-term complacency on the part of investors despite still obvious credit market risks with particular focus on Greece and Spain and a looming and potentially strong FOMC catalyst on Wednesday.

  

In conjunction with a break of the closely watched 20% level which twice in the past month has acted as support for the VIX, the sentiment gauge is now a full 15% below its 10-day simple moving average. Readings of 15% or greater are typically an indication prices in the broader average are readying to move in the opposite direction of the short-term trend as sentiment sets itself up for a return back towards its mean as represented by the 10-day simple moving average.

  

As there are no guarantees with the market and maybe as the saying goes, "Rules were made to be broken", we can't help but wonder aloud if today's move in the VIX is a bullish omen for the broader market, rather than a more traditional sign alerting investors to be cautious? 

  

It would be nice to simply be optimistic and vote in favor of the former. But given those other options which allow option traders to act like hedgehogs rather than overt bulls thinking this time is seriously different or that the veil of uncertainty and June Gloom are just going to vanish; softer delta strategies such as verticals or to steal one from Chris Tyler, putting a collar on that bull, look to be wise choices to consider.

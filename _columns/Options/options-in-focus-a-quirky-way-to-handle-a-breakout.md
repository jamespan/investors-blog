Some may think of adjusting a spread that's working in our favor as a quirky way to handle a position. Such might the case with a bull put spread discussed on Monday in **CF Industries Holdings**  ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)). The piece focused on CF's breakout from a loose consolidation or what some might call a "quirky" handle and using a vertical as a means to initiating a possible collar or perhaps taking in the credit and repeating the cycle. 

  

With the described breakout gaining ground for the period and now challenging its prior cup or "W'ish" shaped base highs our June 145 / 140 bull put spread is profitable by $0.60 to $0.70 but still roughly $1.00 from reaching its max profit potential anywhere above 145. 

  

While our hypothesized collar strategist is on his way to collecting some premium as long as shares continue to cooperate, one somewhat quirky adjustment a trader in this same position might consider making given potential resistance from the former highs and a market still not up to the challenge of being a confirmed uptrend, is the Iron Condor. 

  

As the established bull put is now profitable and CF has rallied up to make the 150 strike the new at-the-money and one which coincides with some possible backing and filling; a trader could sell the June 150 / 155 bear call spread to lock in an Iron Condor or "IC" with virtually no risk.  



  

Looking above, the risk and reward profile of the two positions are dramatically different. As much, when we say the IC might not be for everyone, we actually mean it. That said, our own experience often shows us how these quirky or odd looking adjustments find a way of turning into better-looking adjustments over time; particularly when when market conditions are still less than ideal for bulls. With that in mind and less than "W'ishful" than otherwise, this IC looks like decent fertilizer for the portfolio to grow stronger.

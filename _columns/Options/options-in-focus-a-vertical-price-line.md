Amidst a pressured Tuesday for the broader market, shares of Internet travel giant **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) are floating nicely above its 50-day simple moving average. Following an out-the-gate near test of that line's technical wherewithal, shares have rallied to around the unchanged level.

  

The price action in PCLN is also making an optimistic statement on the charts by establishing what could turn out to be a a pivot low for a handle consolidation within a four-month long, corrective double-bottom base. 

  

Despite today's bullish features, option traders have put together a rather ambivalent and neutral put/call ratio of 0.94 and roughly 6,500 contracts apiece changing hands. Implieds have lifted but trade only slightly above statistical values. However, on a dollar basis premiums look more expensive than booking a first class seat on board Richard Branson's SpaceShip Two due to PCLN's underlying $500 price tag and mid-40s implieds. 

  

What's a bull to do? For a better positional lift-off, "going vertical" looks about right in our view. Given liquidity which is present but one whose individual call and put markets are loose enough to reflect PCLN's often bouncy $0.50 to $1.00 blips on the radar, the two legged spread is a good compromise for bulls. 

  

In favor of the vertical, the limited risk spread can vigorously reduce the cost to position on a one-to-one contract basis and rid the trader of any unwanted vega risk. Because of its simplicity in using just one contract month and two strikes, the trader also has a real world opportunity to get filled around mid market without having to endure too many of those sometimes slippery and fore-mentioned "blips on the radar." 

  

  

Of course, these type perks do come with a cost. The big obstacle for many traders is the speed at which the vertical's capped profits are secured compared to a potential outright long call position should shares really ignite and move skyward. On the other hand, given the amount of mishaps which often occur before enjoying a riveting and unobstructed journey into those unchartered blue heavens on our price charts; it seems well worth the price of consideration. 

  

Shown above and to illustrate is a 1x October 540 / 560 bull call spread priced mid market for $8.50. Potential profits of $11.50 at expiration would occur if shares of PCLN were above the sold 560 call. At the same time, this position will break even if shares are above 548.50, while the outright 540 call would require a price of 567.35 and the 560s (if purchased) a more orbital 578.85.

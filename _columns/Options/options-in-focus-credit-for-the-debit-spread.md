The fascination with credit spreads compared to debit spreads can't be denied or can it? The fact is if there were a systematic advantage, it would be exploited, arbed out and non-existent. Case in point, did you know an out-of-the-money bull put spread initiated for a credit is the same as buying an in-the-money bull call spread for a debit when dealing with identical strikes and the same contract month? Well, if you didn't, you should.

  

Aside from out of the money puts sometimes having better liquidity provision, the risk and reward of the two verticals are identical, as well as what needs to be put up in the trading account. What? You didn't think that credit was really for free or at an advantage over the call vertical did you? For instance, on a vertical such as a two-and-a-half point bull put spread, if you take in a credit of $0.50 your broker will demand you have capital on hand to sufficiently cover the risk of two points before backing in the credit. The net result is $200 per spread of buying power has been removed from the account until proven differently. 

  

At the same time, if and in most instances the same strike call vertical can be negotiated in the open market for a debit of $2.00, this likeminded bullish investor is also tying up two points of capital, though in a more straightforward manner as the debit paid is simply subtracted from the account's buying power. At the end of the day or umm, at expiration, if the credit spread shows a profit, the debit spread will, barring slippage, reflect the same dollar gain. Likewise, if there's a loss in one type of spread, rest assured their credit or debit-munching brethren are feeling the same amount of limited risk pain.

  

That all said, one real benefit of the put spread is the opportunity on occasion to close out just the short put and maintain the further away long put for the longshot payoff with no real extra risk involved if it's far enough away from being in the money. In this situation, the trader with the bull call spread would need to exit their position in full or otherwise face large delta risk which could wipe out their paper profits and turn into a loss.

  

On the plus side, an early assignment for the bull call spread would allow that trader to maximize his or her profit potential before expiration or maintain a synthetic long put with no risk. Admittedly this type event is unlikely, especially compared to the potential perk of buying in the short put cheaply. Nonetheless, it can happen on occasion and could provide a nice quicker-than-expected gain or an even nicer windfall if all goes, not according to plan, for the other call trader unwisely exercising their right to stock ownership prematurely.

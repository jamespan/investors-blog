More than a few people on Wall Street have been known to agree with the saying a person can't go broke taking profits. While that easy-on-the-eyes adage is debatable, one possible way to secure profits more smartly is to make use of the option market when trading a one-legged option position.

  

By being mindful of the synthetic market before exiting a position like a long call or long put, it's possible to sometimes save a couple pennies to perhaps a nickel or even a dime here and there. And over the long run, that could turn into a good deal more regarding our bottom-line.

  

So, how exactly might this be done in real life? We'll focus on the long put position in XYZ Corp to illustrate this concept by showing how a slight variation in option and stock prices, evaluating liquidity and applying synthetic relationships could lead to stronger results over the long-term.

  

Trader Gordon Gekko, a known whale or size player, has been short XYZ Corp for some time via a long June 42 put contract which he purchased for $1.00 after his homework told him shares were vastly overvalued at 44. With the stock trading down to 38.50 over the course of a handful of weeks, he senses it's now time to exit. But is it time to sell the put for a profit? 

  

With XYZ at 38.50 the June 42 put is quoted $3.40 bid / $3.60 ask. XYZ's options aren't exactly the most liquid game in town despite shares trading heavily enough to satisfy most all investor appetites within five cents of the going market price. 

  

At the same time the reciprocal June 42 call market for the out-of-money option is $0.00 bid / $0.15 ask. In this instance and despite what would amount to a nice profit, the pricing of the two options dictates Gordon would be better off purchasing stock rather than simply "selling to close" his position. 

  

In this quoted situation and given GG's typical larger to block-size positioning, an order to sell the put, even at mid market, would result in a fill of $3.50 and net profit of $2.50 per contract. That sale has an equivalent call parity value of $0.00. Still, the question of whether market makers would be willing to take the trade in an attempt to lock in the long call synthetic for free is far from a guaranteed "yes." 

  

Given the pretty much "rip up" current market in the call and Gordon's contract size, when the puts do trade, the market makers will (theoretically) have to run out and buy stock. As much, they'd likely have to "pay up" about five cents, which in turn means they'd be paying a likely small debit of $0.05 per contract for the synthetic call. 

  

All told and with those puts trading in ten cent increments, the market makers could be apt to say, "Hit the bid Gordo or walk away." And to which, he likely should. Instead, if by purchasing an equivalent amount of shares at $38.50 in his own account and paying no worse than $38.55 if his size forces that situation; Gordon is still systematically locking in a profit of $2.45 to $2.50 per contract. 

  

Remember or realize this, GG is effectively short stock from 41 (Put — premium paid), so buying stock at no more than 38.55 would guarantee a minimum profit of $2.45 and better than the "to close" $2.40 per contract realistically available in the option market. 

  

Additionally, this method also enjoys the teaser of Gordon now being long a near worthless synthetic June 42 call. That means if his "friend" Sir Larry opts to stage a hostile takeover and there's still time until expiration—well, Gordon could turn out to be a very savvy synthetic shark and big winner (again) riding that other whale's coattails.

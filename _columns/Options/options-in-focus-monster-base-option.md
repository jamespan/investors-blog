It seems appropriate to us, changing the name Hansen's Natural and the now defunct ticker "HANS" to **Monster Beverage Corp** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) given the gargantuan stature of the company's muscular beverage product. But the change also seems a sign of the times given MNST's rather monster or enormous and bubbly-looking four-month long ascending base.

  

First off, let's caveat MNST's base by saying it is admittedly a slightly flawed formation. For one, the construction maintains basically four pivot highs rather than the classic three since construction began back in early August. Furthermore, the first pivot high, which we're classifying as occurring back on September 21, did subsequently see shares slide 19%. That's a bit more than the idealized maximum 15% dip to start off the first counter wave.

  

Other than those pesky details, which I'm almost certain are subject to revision by other prying eyes, the new and improved Hansen's i.e. Monster, still affords traders listed calls and puts to protect and maybe even juice up one's stock holdings.

  

The downside, as was the case with Hansen's, the name change hasn't improved its option's liquidity. Personally, we'd label those markets as only moderately yummy and good for either outrights and maybe two-sided spreads like a vertical, calendar or diagonal. That all said, while Monster's options aren't going to win flavor of the month anytime soon, they're good enough to consume in moderation without any adverse side effects.

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is one of the strongest stocks in the market. During the recent decline, shares never got below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).




Nvidia is a top-performing half-position holding in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) and sits on the [Leaders Near A Buy Point](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) list.


With the [market still in a correction](https://research.investors.com/markettrend.aspx), investors may not want to risk too much capital on new stock purchases.


Yet the great thing about options is that investors can take directional exposure for a fraction of buying the stock. One way to do that is via a bullish option trade known as a bull call spread.


Nvidia Stock And A Bull Call Spread
-----------------------------------



A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy that is created through [buying a call](https://www.investors.com/research/options/options-trading-how-to-start-using-options-how-to-manage-risk/) and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


On Nvidia stock, going out to options expiring on Nov. 20, a 520 strike call option was trading around $44 on Friday and a 540 call was around $35.50.


Buying the 520 call and selling the 540 call would create a bull call spread.


The cost of the trade would be around $850 and the maximum profit potential would be $1,150. We calculate this by taking the difference in strike prices of $20 times 100 shares, less the premium paid.


How Much Would This Option Trade Lose?
--------------------------------------


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy, so if the price of Nvidia stock closes below 520 on Nov. 20, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $850 premium paid.


Potential gains get capped above 540, so no matter how high Nvidia might go, the most the trade could profit is $1,150.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way to gain a bullish exposure to a top stock using options. But remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Options, perhaps, have more myths about them than any subject related to investing and trading. These myths persist despite the industry's existence in the U.S. for 40 years. This is the third and final article in a series that addresses several myths about options and tries to set the record straight. In [previous](http://news.investors.com/investing-options/061213-659834-myths-about-options-and8211-take-1.htm) [articles](http://news.investors.com/investing-options/061913-660585-10-myths-about-options-and8211-take-2.htm) several myths were debunked, including myths such as "90% of options expire worthless," "you should only buy undervalued options," and "trading options is a zero-sum game." 

  

**Myth #7: The market makers beat you every time.**

  

It is a common misconception that non-professional investors and traders are competing against the professional market makers. It is believed by some that, in order for the professionals to profit, the non-professionals must lose. "Since they study the market full time," the reasoning goes, "it is impossible to beat them."

  

What this line of reasoning misses is that market makers are in a different business than either investors or speculators. Investors want to benefit from long-term stock ownership. Investors generally use only bullish strategies, and they use options to reduce risk and increase income from non-leveraged equity holdings. Speculators, in contrast, attempt to make money by predicting short-term price changes. Speculators frequently use leverage, and they use both bullish and bearish strategies. Market makers have a third method of making money, the business of arbitrage. A market maker's goal is to buy at the bid price and sell at the ask price, thus making the spread in between. By managing market-neutral positions, market makers attempt to make many small profits on a high volume of trades. Market makers, as a rule, do not trade market direction.

  

Investors, speculators and market makers are not in competition with each other. They have different ways of making money, and they are all essential to properly-function markets.

  

**Myth #8: Selling puts is risky.**

  

This is an interesting statement, because there are frequently two diametrically opposed groups of attendees at seminars at The Options Institute. The first group states confidently, "I never sell puts, because it is simply too risky!" The second group then says, with equal confidence, "I always sell puts, because it is so conservative!" Which group is right? The answer is, "it depends."

  

"Selling a put" creates an obligation to buy the underlying stock. If the investor wants to buy the shares and has the money to buy the shares, then this obligation is no more risky than buying stock. This is known as a "cash-secured" short put. If assignment occurs, then stock is purchased, 100 shares for each short put. The "effective price" of the purchased shares is the strike price of the put less the premium received plus commissions. After acquiring shares via put assignment, the investor should have a plan for monitoring the stock position.

  

Now suppose that the assumptions from above are not true. Suppose that the investor with the short put position does not want to buy the underlying stock and, furthermore, does not have sufficient cash to do so. This short put position is known as a "naked put." The percentage risk of a naked put is substantially greater than that of a cash-secured put.

  

Assume, for example, that a 50-strike put is sold for $2 per share. The maximum risk of this position is $48 per share plus commissions, and this risk would be realized if the stock price declines to zero. The question is, what percentage of the equity capital supporting the position does the $48 represent? If the short put position is fully collateralized with $48 in equity in the form of cash, then the risk of $48 is 100% of the $48 in equity. However, if a trader is approved for margin account trading, then it is possible to establish this short put position with less than the full $48 per share, not including minimum account requirements. If the short put described above is established with equity of only $16 per share, for example, then the potential risk of $48 is 300% of the $16 in equity.

  

Understanding the difference between a "cash-secured" put and a "naked" put is the key to understanding "risk." Cash-secured puts have risk similar to purchasing stock, and naked puts have substantially higher risk in percentage terms.

  

**Myth #9: Option positions must be watched every minute.**

  

Some traders do need to constantly stay on top of their positions, and others do not. The difference is not options. The difference is one's psychological ability to live with the risk of adverse price fluctuations. This is known as the "sleep factor." Let's say that a small price change in your position causes you to make or lose $1,000. It also means that five small changes in the same direction will cause you to make or lose $5,000. Is there a high probability that five small price changes in the same direction will happen, and does such a risk cause you such anxiety that you have to watch the market every second to make sure that you are okay? If the answer is, "yes," then the positions you are trading are too big. That is not the fault of options; that is the fault of size.

  

The art of trading involves managing capital in a way that is consistent with your comfort level. This means that, if the market has a big adverse move, then you will not be motivated to "jump out the window." You must be able to psychologically accept the probable risk of your positions so that you can maintain your ability to make rational decisions. If you trade too big, then emotions might interfere and cause you to take irrational, and costly, actions. Unfortunately, there is no formula to determine what is an appropriate position size. This is something that every trader must determine individually.

  

**Myth #10: I can trade stocks; therefore, I can trade options.**

  

There are two points to be made. First, trading is different than investing. Second, trading stocks is different than trading options.

  

It is important to identify the difference between investing and trading, because many people call themselves "traders," when they are actually acting like investors. People who "buy and hold," for example, tend to be investors. Although there are no absolute rules that separate investing and trading, investing generally has a longer time horizon than trading. Also, most investments are motivated by fundamental factors. In contrast, trading strategies are more often chosen because of technical factors such as breakouts, double bottoms and double tops. Another common difference is that investors generally do not use leverage, i.e., they will not buy stock on margin. It is common practice, however, for traders to use leverage in a variety of ways. Buying calls without having cash available to purchase the underlying stock involves leverage. Selling naked puts, as discussed above, is another strategy employing leverage.

  

Trading stocks and trading options differ in the nature of the forecast that is required. To trade a stock, all that is required is a bullish or bearish forecast. If you buy a stock, for example, the price can rise tomorrow, next week or next year. In all three cases, if the stock price rises, you make money. In the case of options, however, time is crucial. If you buy a one-month call, and the stock does not rise until the second month, then you have a losing option trade.

  

The relationship of the stock price to the option's strike price is also important. A stock price can fall from $50 to $43, but if you purchased the 40-strike Put, then you can still have a losing trade.

  

A third factor, the implied volatility in an option price, can also affect results of option strategies. There is not enough space to discuss this topic in depth, but the volatility component in an option's price corresponds to the risk component in an insurance premium. Implied volatility is the volatility percentage that justifies the market price of an option. Implied volatility is market-determined, and it changes as investor perceptions of risk change. Before a company announces earnings, for example, the implied volatility may rise as the market becomes increasingly anxious about the announcement. After the report, regardless of the price action of the stock, implied volatility might decrease if investors believe that "all the news is out."

  

Trading options is unique, because option traders need a three-part forecast. They need a specific prediction for the stock price, the time period and the level of implied volatility. In contrast, stock traders need only a forecast for the general direction of the stock price.

  

**Conclusion**

  

Your chances of success are improved if you approach trading like a business. What is your method of market forecasting, and how will you apply that method? How will you manage your capital? How much time per day, per week or per month will you devote to trading?

  

Rather than worry about broad generalizations, such as the common myths about options discussed in this series, think about how you define success and make a step-by-step plan that will help you achieve that success.

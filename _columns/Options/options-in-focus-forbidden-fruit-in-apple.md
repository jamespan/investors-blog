Leading Tuesday's charge higher for many larger institutional investors, other than the day's headlines regarding Greece and an attached soothing lower U.S. dollar, was none other than **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Not only did the computing behemoth's shares manage to reclaim the 50-day simple moving average, it did so in heavy volume. 

  

Altogether, Apple shares could be offering some strong technical signs of better days ahead for the broader market. However, with the influential heavyweight's recent breakdown taking a constructive double bottom shaped base and turning it into a more quirky-looking formation, traders may still have good reason to be cautious. 

  

For traders involving themselves in the kingpin's options, some of that caution showed up in some very heavy near-term activity in both Apple's Weekly June calls and puts. While Apple typically enjoys all-around strong option volume, it's rare to see this very short-term bet with so much relative volume compared to its regular contracts, unless it happens to be Expiration Friday for those calls and puts.

  

In heavier than normal option trading of 300,000 contracts compared to an average of about 250,000, the Weekly June calls and puts have traded around 120,000 of the day's total thus far or about 40% of the overall volume. Calls are seeing favor by a mostly typical 1.5-to-1 margin over the puts intraday with the most active contract being the at-the-money 345 call on volume of nearly 28,000.

  

"Cautious?" Some might ask whether trading contracts with such a narrow and finite amount of time remaining, can be considered cautious. Personally, this strategist's view is that it can be at times. On one level of course, increased negative gamma and theta risks for both the short contract seller and the buyer of the same contract, can be extra challenging to one's P&L. 

  

On the other hand, when we consider spreads which might neutralize those risks or maybe positioning extra gingerly with these type contracts as a means of testing the waters; I believe there is room to remove some of the stigma. In the end, I'd rather at least look, rather than ignore what the other guy or gal might be doing just because they may play by different rules of engagement than you or me.

Shares of IBD 50 constituent and sweat fashionista purveyor **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) were looking a bit hot and bothered Friday. After narrowly reaching fresh highs out-the-gate, shares quickly retreated in a downward dog like maneuver and finishing the session off nearly 3%.

  

On the option side, with no related prints to speak of and little existing open interest, one large and undeterred bull looks to have purchased 12,551 April 80 calls for $1.60 during the opening tumble off highs as shares traded down about a buck off highs of 74.50 near 73.50. The dollar commitment of is just north of $2 million dollars and allows the trader the right, not obligation, to acquire a bit more than 1.25 million shares of LULU at $80.

  

With shares having pressed another 1.50 points lower and near $72 since the trader acquired those rights and the contract losing $0.24 in value to a closing price of $1.34, that reflects a paper loss of just more than $300,000. That's some serious coin to consider. The good news is with a delta of 25, the stock need only rebound by a point. With today's buyer driving the order flow and earnings set for next Thursday morning, a modest nudge higher in implieds is helping Lululemon's resident bull, ever slightly, counter a bit of the negative impact of wearing the wrong delta in Friday's session.

  

Looking forward, we'd bet this obviously well-capitalized trader doesn't have a game plan in front of the report, though they believe they have the inside skinny on what's in store for investors. That said, this bull is likely willing to use their right to hold on to defined, albeit large risk, with the hope of feeling obliged, down the road past earnings, to some exercising of their own, and which has nothing to do with spandex and sweat suits.

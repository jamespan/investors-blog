As seasoned options traders can attest, one of the best things about stock option trading for beginners is the new world of possibilities it opens. This is true for both options and stock. Options settle to stock. Because of this, some of the simplest stock option trading strategies can be best.




The simplest way to understand options is to know the four actions an investor can take. An investor can buy a call, sell a call, buy a put, or sell as put. Knowing the definitions of each is crucial.

Looking at the definitions of each there are key distinctions. Options buyers have rights. Options sellers have obligations. These two distinctions are important and each present different opportunity. Most new options traders use options as a speculative tool, typically buying options. A lot of options trading beginners are fearful of obligations, but selling options can be a valuable tool.


Selling Options
---------------


One of the best strategies for beginning options traders is to sell puts. By selling puts, an options trader is taking on an obligation to buy stock. In exchange for taking on this obligation, this options trader is receiving a payment. This payment can serve to improve cashflow and decrease the cost basis of the stock. An example of this in action would be Square.


Look at the example as a bullish investor. For this example they want to own **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) and think that the optimal price to pay is 70 per share. In this example an investor has two choices:


1. Wait for price to drop to 70.


2. Sell the next month 70 Put and receive a credit while waiting.

In this example, the 70 put would pay the investor a credit of $2.16 for a one-month put. By selling this put, the investor is obligated to buy Square for the next month, but at the price they want. Over the course of the next month, SQ can move one of three ways.


Square's Price Action
---------------------


**Up**: If SQ moves up, the investor does not buy the stock. At the end of the month, the obligation expires. In this case the investor keeps the full $2.16 credit they received. If the investor did this in an IRA and the full 70 was tied up, the rate of return would be 3.08% for one month. For the next month, the investor can reevaluate if they want to do it again or change strategies.


**Sideways**: If SQ remains relatively flat, the investor does not buy the stock. At the end of the month, the obligation expires, and the investor keeps the $2.16 credit they received. If the investor did this in an IRA and the full 70 was tied up, the rate of return would be 3.08% for 1 month. Since price is relatively unchanged, the investor can repeat the same strike the next month.


**Down**: If SQ drops in price to the 70 strike, there is a chance the investor will be "put" the stock. The investor will have to buy the stock but keep the $2.16 credit. This $2.16 credit makes the cost basis of the stock 67.84, essentially allowing the investor the ability to buy the stock at a discount.


The risk of this strategy is the exact same risk profile as owning the stock at the short strike. So as an investor, the 8% stop loss rule would still apply. If the stock drops below the 8% stop loss point, if they have not been assigned the stock they may want to buy back the short put.

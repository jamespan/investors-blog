It's always tricky business as to how stock investors will react to a report. What numbers or guidance actually "disappoints" or "pleases" investors runs much deeper than the simple analysis of comparing actual results versus estimates. That said though, one place where traders can gauge the size of the expected move related to earnings is the option market. 

  

Using implied volatility readings which are based on a one standard deviation or roughly 67% vote of confidence, one can estimate what traders collectively see as the over / under for the movement in shares over a certain period. When Weekly options are offered and are also heavily traded as to afford some honest to goodness betting which goes beyond just the theoretical; this view becomes all the more rigid in its expectations. 

  

One such stock, which fits the bill is **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). In front of tonight's earnings report, heavy trading in the active surrounding money April "Weeklys" are implying, pardon the pun, that there's a one standard deviation chance shares of AMZN will remain within approximately 7.50% of its current price of 183. 

  

We obtained that percentage over / under by the following formula:

  

1. 365 calendar days / 3 days to expiration = 121.7.   
2. Square root of 121.7 = 11   
3. 83% IV / 11 = 7.50%  


  

So, by Friday's close and at the end of the road for the April Weeklys contract, the estimate set forth by option traders, with the professional money typically taking the under bet i.e. shorting premium, believes shares will be somewhere between 196.75 and 169.25.

  

The implications of the option pricing are of course, sometimes wrong and in truth not everyone impacting call and put premiums today are playing the same game. Further, these prices ultimately have little to do with cups or double bottom undercut bases. Nonetheless, knowing how other traders are looking to "handle" earnings more effectively using a different set of rules and tools in the option market, is thought worth learning in order to gain a stronger positional edge than otherwise.

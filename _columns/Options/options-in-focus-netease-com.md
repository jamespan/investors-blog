IBD 50 constituent and China-based Internet portal **NetEase** ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) was left behind on Thursday as the market rose to the occasion during the second half to finish largely flat. With shares off nearly 3% by the closing bell, option traders appeared to trading in prescient sympathy with price action that amounted to a technical break of 50-day simple moving average support in an engulfing bearish candle. 

  

Heavier-than-normal option activity was concentrated in Netease.com's slightly out-of-the-money June 55 put with volume of about 2,400 contracts accounting for roughly 60% of the overall tally of 4,200. Multiple prints with none larger than 190 contracts were put up over the course of the session with the bulk of trading for $1.05 to $1.15. 

  

With open interest entering the session of 1,068 we can make the basic assumption traders were opening positions. We'd go a step further and estimate today's initiating activity was by and large establishing opening purchases of the put as the action began in earnest a little bit more than an hour into the session and shares at that point having reversed into negative territory and below Wednesday's lows. 

  

As of the close and priced mid-market for $1.18, a naked long put position will need NTES to drop, at most, roughly 9% by expiration in order to double in value to $2.36. A modest dip in implieds on the session could suggest sellers as driving today's order flow. However, our view is the pressure is the somewhat artificial or anticipatory result of market makers pricing in the forthcoming long holiday weekend, despite some estimated long put demand. 

  

Technically, with shares of NTES hitting a high of 61 but only to fail once again in holding above its initial late March base highs of 60.47, we can't help appreciate stock action which might make investors a bit nervous and seek out some form of protection like a long put against a long stock position or cause a speculative bear to ante up for some short deltas.

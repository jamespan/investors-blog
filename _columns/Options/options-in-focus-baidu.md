Shares of China based search giant **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) are under stiff selling pressure Thursday. With less than an hour left, the stock is off about 11%. A broad-based investigation by the Department of Justice into the accounting practices of Chinese companies, ongoing political risks, growing concerns about the country's economic strength going forward and maybe a bearish head and shoulder pattern, all appear to be playing roles in influencing bulls to behave a bit less so. 

  

Amongst option traders, the action has been equally forceful. Puts have found favor over calls by a 1.30-to-1.0 margin on massive volume of more than 210,000 and compared to an average day's rake of about 60,000. With Weeklys on the board and set to expire tomorrow, those contracts have proven the most active on multiple surrounding money strikes. 

  

Premiums are also strongly suggesting the conviction of today's more bearish traders (for better or worse) as implieds have jumped roughly 20% to 50% depending on the contract month of interest, while hitting multi-month highs well above statistical range values.

  

What's it all mean to shares of BIDU going forward? Well if our chart work proves correct and today's fast money crowd isn't so fast to already be done counting their coin.Â Perhaps a test of 100 is in the cards sometime soon. Beyond that and likely beyond tomorrow's less lauded expiration; in lieu of the rich pricing and given the luxury of strong liquidity provision, spreading that delta bias out a bit with one of those versatile verticals we like to stress in such times, still sounds about right.

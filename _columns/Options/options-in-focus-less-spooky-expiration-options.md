With an ominous-sounding quadruple witching facing investors Friday, it's an opportune time to discuss a favorite lesson of ours regarding 'other' expiration options. Puns aside, by knowing how to more effectively deal with certain option contracts set to expire, you'll be more confident and perhaps a bit better off in the trading account than otherwise, rather than foolishly spooked out of a position.

  

Truthfully, closing out an option position the old fashioned way in the open market might sound like anything but neglectful during the final days of a contract's life. Sometimes though, there are savvier alternatives. Let's explore a couple of simple but potentially more elegant ways to close down risk, which at times can make a good deal more "sense and cents" around expiration.

  

In our first scenario, we'll assume a trader initially purchased an ATM September 70 call for $2.10 in XYZ Corp., as shares cleared a 71.50 buy point with about three to four weeks of life left in the contract. A couple of weeks later and what ultimately proved a timely buy, the trader realizes they'd like to book profits with the stock at $76. Intrinsically, the call is worth $6 per contract but when the trader goes to close out the position by offering the call at $6.00, they notice the market is quoted as $5.70 bid / $6.00 ask. 

  

The trader might see the above quote and think "good enough for government work", hit the bid of $5.70 and call it a day with $3.60 in profits. In certain instances the trader might be right for taking this action. The most compelling reason is in highly volatile markets it might not be worth squabbling over a few pennies or even a quarter as you could quickly find yourself giving back a good deal more. But, if the trader executes in this manner without first looking at other available opportunities; over the long run they could be costing themselves real and sometimes, even much larger profits. 

  

One exiting strategy worth checking into is the 'same day exercise.' If your broker allows the use of this order, the trader can look to sell XYZ at the current market price of 76 and capture $6.00 from the long stock exercised for 70. Effectively, this process lets the trader pocket an extra $0.30 versus the discussed and traditional "sell to close" exit for $5.70 on the bid. This method even tops a sale of $5.80 to $5.90 in the call, if he or she felt splitting the current call market was feasible.

  

Of course, you should make sure the commission bill is less than the amount saved and liquidity in the underlying stock will also need to be determined adequate for this kind of exiting strategy to work effectively. If the trader can't realistically sell the stock for better than 75.90 thereabouts, the "good enough" option of selling the contract itself would likely make prudent sense at that point.

  

A second possible 'option', if the trading account "can cover" such a position and shares are available to sell short, is to short the stock at 76. This action converts the position into a synthetic long put through expiration. In this scenario, we can guess the equivalent well-out-of-money 70 put market is a "rip up" i.e. "no bid and offered" situation when this strategy is actually executed. However, with corrections in the market popping up from time to time, you never know if the "rip up" might turn into something of extreme value in short order.

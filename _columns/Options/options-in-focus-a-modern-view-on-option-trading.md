I was schooled in options a long time ago, back before smart phones and much closer to the days when Gordon Gekko's clunker of a device was the coolest and most mobile toy on the market. Not much has changed since then in the pricing of options. Sure, a few traders have been compelled to make minor tweaks to Black Scholes. But the strategies themselves are wholly unchanged during this stretch of time that goes from the late 80s and through present day 2010. 

  

One subtle shift though which this old dog has learned to appreciate is what Optionetics calls the modern risk graph. Back in the day I didn't have a choice as to how I saw risk related to an option position. For one, my risk manager back when I was on the AMEX trading floor was always just a landline phone call away.

  

As much he would gladly remind me multiple times a day just where the profits and losses lay—as well as any other menacing Greeks associated with any positions held. We parted ways back in the 90s but it took a lot longer for me to see an option position's risk profile in a whole new light called the modern risk graph at Optionetics and accept it as a pretty darned good evolution but one still not considered the industry standard. 

  

  

Shown above to illustrate the old school way of seeing things, let's take a slightly closer-to-the action sojourn back to September 2010 and look at a position consisting of 5 October 22 calls in **Rackspace** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)). On this view and as option traders are familiar with; profits go up as shares move to the right along the X axis, which is supposed to represent a rising stock price.

  

Looking below is the same exact bullish profile position but using the modern risk graph. The difference on this view is the P&L moves in sympathy with the underlying instrument. Both the modern risk graph and stock charts share the common characteristic of using the Y-axis to represent the movement of shares—both up and down! Hey, what a concept!

  

  

In the end and regardless of which risk graph a trader relies upon, the P&L's of both positions at any given time are unequivocally one in the same. But, while there's nothing that can alter that fact and don't suspect it to ever change as long as humans are in control of the trading—I don't mind embracing the sense and sometimes "cents and dollars" that go along with the modern but age old view of things.

Square stock is a fast-growing name in the online payment space. But with daunting competition from the likes of **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)), **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)), **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) has its hands full. But growth prospects are still bright at Square, with full-year profit expected to surge 70% this year and 52% in 2019.


Earnings are due Wednesday after the close. According to Zacks Investment Research, quarterly profit should be up 75% to 14 cents a share, with sales up 47% to $908.2 million.


Square stock had been on a nice roll in 2018 until the bottom fell out at the beginning of October. Square fell some 50% from its highs in just three months, getting belted with the rest of the market into the end of the year. The stock has bounced back nicely in 2019, but it's still about 23% off its high. A strong earnings report Wednesday could be the catalyst to get the stock back to the old highs at around 100.


Square Stock: Option Trade
--------------------------


With high-growth names like Square, option premiums tend to be pricey. As such, we would like to take some of the time decay away from a trade. With Square sitting around the 77 level, a monthly call option using the April 70 strike is an attractive option.


The premium for this in the money strike is $9.90, but it has about $7.20 of intrinsic value and only $2.70 of time decay (the option is deep in the money). As the market is expecting a very large move for Square stock (more than 12%), a move above the 85 level would have this trade in profit mode.


Paying $9.90 for a call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Square at 70, and costs only $990 per contract. This equates to just a bit more than one-seventh the cost of 100 shares of the stock outright. The most you can lose is $990 for one contract.


Square stock could easily get back to the old highs in a hurry with a strong earnings report. Recent earnings for growth companies like Square and other payment processors have been positive.


Breadth of leadership in the group is also strong. IBD's payment processing group recently ranked 48th out of 197 groups ranked by IBD based on six-month price performance. Square's Composite Rating of 96 ranks it No. 5 in the group behind names like Mastercard and PayPal.

Shares of technically at-risk Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR) bounced Tuesday and bulls in its listed options appeared responsive. With the stock finishing up 2.70% and attempting to validate a recent gap fill wedged between its 50 and 200-day simple moving averages as a corrective low, option traders picked up calls by a two-to-one margin in ten times its daily average on volume of 8,700 contracts. 

  

Checking the board for further details and beneath the surface, the option activity appears a bit more subdued. In the February contract, the heaviest call volume could be found in the February 42 calls. About 1,200 contracts changed hands versus open interest of 1,400. 

  

The trading, aside from not having a firm grip on whether the call activity represented the opening or closing of positions, largely matched and showed similar out of the money positioning compared to the most active put. Further, implieds were rather stable on the session. That suggests the net favor towards the call contract isn't indicative of net bullish buyers.

  

Looking a bit further out, some opening activity amounting to about 600 contracts in the newly listed at-the-money March 38 call was put up. Roughly 40% of the volume was the work of one print and doesn't appear tied to any other option trading.

  

A naked purchase will require a max move of 20% by expiration in order to see a double in price from $3.55 to $7.10. At the same time, the likes of a less bullish play such as a buy-write would be shaving about 9% off the cost of a long stock position with a breakeven of around 33.75. Profits are capped to 12.50% but the possibility to cover and roll up to a higher strike could increase those gains prior to expiration. 

  

And out in the not-too-distant future of April three in-the-money call strikes were active. Volume of about 2,000 represents a bit more than 20% of today's contracts. However, with a good chunk of that action appearing to be vertical positioning and the strikes at just one-point intervals. Those low delta wagers do little to summon up any additional bullish appreciation for shares of QCOR from this strategist.

A week into Murat Cetinkaya’s term as central bank governor and bearish bets on the lira have fallen to the lowest level in almost two years.


The premium for 12-month options to sell lira vs. the dollar -- rather than to buy Turkey’s currency -- fell to 4.75 percentage points on Tuesday, the least since July 2014, after Cetinkaya said curbing inflation remains the regulator’s top priority. While consumer price growth has stayed above the central bank’s target since 2011, the emphasis on price stability by the monetary authority chief in his first major public appearance signaled that he wasn’t giving in to government calls to radically cut interest rates.


Cetinkaya’s comments “will ease market participants’ concerns, mine as well, but obviously talk is one thing, and while concerns will be reduced they will not disappear,”  Henrik Gullberg, a senior emerging-market strategist at Nomura International in London, said by email.


Former central bank Governor Erdem Basci faced persistent calls by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and senior government officials to cut rates and prioritize growth over inflation. That pressure eroded investor confidence, helping send the lira down 20% in 2015, its third annual decline and biggest drop since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008.


Cetinkaya lowered the upper band of a three-pronged interest-rate corridor by half of a percentage point last week, in line with expectations, in his first rate meeting as head of the central bank. The cut, the second consecutive reduction, was a “measured” step toward simplifying Turkey’s monetary policy framework, he said, referring to a move initiated by Basci to narrow the corridor around one main rate.


The lira jumped 0.9% to 2.8188 vs. the dollar on Tuesday, the biggest gain in four weeks. While the currency is up only 0.8% since Cetinkaya was named to head the monetary authority on April 19, that’s the best performance in emerging Europe. The risk-reversal rate has dropped 0.55 percentage points over the same period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.


Cetinkaya left this year’s inflation forecast at 7.5%. Consumer-price growth slowed to 7.46% in March, the lowest in seven months, while core inflation, which excludes volatile components such as food and energy prices, dropped to 9.51% from the highest since July 2014.


Investors still need “confirmation at the next meetings that further rate cuts only materialize after core CPI deceleration,” said Nomura’s Gullberg.

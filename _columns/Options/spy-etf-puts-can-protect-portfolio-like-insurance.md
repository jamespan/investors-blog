Options can be used to generate extra income like in last week's Tesla bull [put spread example](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tsla-stock-put-spread-profits-if-support-holds/). But they can also be used to protect a stock holding from a large drop in price.




With the stock market looking extended here, it might be time to look at buying some protection on stocks that you don't necessarily want to sell.


A put option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain underlying asset at a given price (the strike price) on or before expiration.


For this right, the buyer of the put option pays a premium to the option seller. Think of it like buying insurance against your house burning down. You, as the homeowner, pay the insurance premium. And the option seller is like the insurance company.


A put option gives the owner the right to sell their stock at the strike price, no matter how low the stock price goes. The downside is protected while the investor still gets to benefit in the upside.


Let's assume we own a portfolio of stocks that we don't want to sell but are concerned about the short-term prospects.


SPY Puts Can Act As Insurance On A Stock Portfolio
--------------------------------------------------


Instead of liquidating our portfolio, we could buy put options on the **SPDR S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) to help cushion the effects of any downturn.


On Friday, with the SPY ETF trading around 381, a Feb. 19 expiration put with a strike price of 380 could be purchased for $8.25 per contract. That would be $825 in total for a contract that controls a block of 100 shares. The break-even price for the put option would be 371.75 and can be calculated by taking the strike price (380) and subtracting the premium paid ($8.25).



Buying some protection like this can be expensive, but it can also help us sleep a little better at night if we are concerned about a large drop in stocks over the next month.


This February 380 put option has an initial notional delta of -17,000. That simply means that it will roughly hedge the price risk of a $17,000 portfolio of stocks.


However, it's never perfect. You could find yourself in a position where the stocks you own drop but SPY ETF rallies, in which case the hedge would not work at all.


Put options can help protect against large price declines and are an important risk management tool for investors.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

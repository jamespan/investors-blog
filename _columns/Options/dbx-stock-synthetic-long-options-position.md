**Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) stock ripped higher on Friday and broke out above key resistance.




DBX stock is highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 98 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 56. Dropbox is also ranked No. 1 in the Computer Software-Database Group.


Today, I want to take a look at a synthetic long stock trade.


A synthetic long stock trade is a way of taking an equivalent long exposure on a stock without having to put up any capital other than the margin requirement (we'll get to that shortly). The strategy is constructed by selling an at-the-money put and buying an at-the-money call.


Let's look at DBX stock as an example.


Assuming an investor wanted bullish exposure via a synthetic long they could sell a 27 put and buy a 27 call.



Currently the Jan. 27 put is trading around $5.15 and the 27 call is trading around $5.35.


Therefore, a January synthetic long stock trade would only cost $0.20 per contract or $20.


**What's The Catch?**
---------------------


I'm glad you asked. As the name suggests, this is a synthetic long position and the trader has a similar exposure to owning 100 shares of the underling. That exposure would cost about $2,700 if the investor bought 100 shares.


So, this is effectively a leveraged position and may not be appropriate for every trader.


Even though the option trade only costs $20, the investor could still lose $2,720 if Dropbox stock went to $0. The advantage of the trade is that an equivalent exposure to owning 100 shares can be gained for only a fraction of the cost.


For this synthetic long position, the margin requirement would be around $1,100, so the investor could use the leverage power of options to trade multiple synthetic long positions with the same amount of capital required to purchase 100 shares.


Of course, leverage is a double edge sword and if the stock drops, losses will be magnified.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

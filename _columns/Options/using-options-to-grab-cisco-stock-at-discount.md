A [weak earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-earnings-cisco-stock-csco-q22020/) punished **Cisco Systems** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) over the last week. If you believe in the mean-reversion trade for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average there could be an opportunity to pick some Cisco stock up at a bargain basement price.




Buying At A Discount With A Cash-Secured Put
--------------------------------------------


As an option trader, you can use a [cash-secured put strategy](https://www.investors.com/research/options/delta-stock-how-to-trade-cash-secured-put-option/) to pick up shares of a stock at a lower cost basis.


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


They are very similar to a [covered call](https://www.investors.com/research/options/verizon-stock-increase-yield-by-16-6-percent-with-covered-calls/) and are quite easy to understand once you know the basics.


It's important that anyone selling puts understands that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price. You have to be OK owning the stock.


In the case of Cisco stock, it is already trading below the 200-day moving average line, has a [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-identifies-strong-stocks/) in a serious downtrend and a lowly [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of just 61. The normal [IBD analysis doesn't put Cisco stock as a buy right now](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cisco-stock-buy-now/).


The Cash-Secured Put For Cisco Stock
------------------------------------



For Cisco stock, a trader selling the Oct 40 put could generate around $1.00 in premium per contract.


As the put seller, you take on the obligation to purchase 100 shares of Cisco stock at 40 if the put buyer exercises their option.


The break-even price for the trade can be calculated by taking the strike price less the premium received. In this example for Cisco stock, the break-even price is 39. That's 6.9% below yesterday's closing price.


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if CSCO stock fell to 0. The trade would lose $3,900 per contract, $4,000 in the stock minus the $100 option premium received. In that way, it's similar to the risk of owning the stock outright. The difference being that you'll lose a little less because the option premium you capture offsets a small portion of the loss.


If the stock stays above 40 at expiration, the put expires worthless. That leaves the option trader with a healthy 2.6% return on capital at risk. That return is calculated by taking the $100 premium received divided by the $3,900 capital at risk.

Getting An Even Better Price
----------------------------


Cash secured puts are a fantastic way to generate a nice return on stocks the trader is happy to own.


Sometimes with a trade like this I'll set my order higher than the current price, say $1.50 in this case and try to generate a bit more premium.


Sometimes the stock drops a bit further allowing you to get filled at a better price.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

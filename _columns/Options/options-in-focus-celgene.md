Positive, encouraging interim data for **Celgene**'s ([CELG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CELG)) Revlimid presented at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology didn't take investors by storm Monday, but the biotech outfit did manage to hold gains on the session with the broader market firmly underwater all session.

  

Technically, the price action on the weekly view shows a stock that's put together a bullish "high handle" within what we'd label as a slightly flawed or quirky double bottom base which began in late March 2010.

  

With shares closing up 0.13 at 63.67, CELG is just through its buy point of 63.56 from a noted mid pivot hatched during the week of November 5, 2010. The price action also marks a third week of higher highs off the described high handle pattern's pivot low.

  

So, what's a bull to do? One idea given the S&P500's still precarious positioning beneath its 200-day simple moving average and a follow-through day still absent, is to go with an in-the-money vertical call spread like the January 60 / 62.5. With shares roughly 2% above the higher strike, this limited risk spread can go from its current price of $1.75 and expand to $2.50 at expiration, even in the event shares drop to but not below the 62.5 strike.

  

The pricing represents a return of more than 40% in 39 calendar days or about 360% annualized. An expiration breakeven of 61.75 allows for shares to move a bit more than 3% against the strategist before losses begin accruing up to the premium paid. The full premium is only at risk if shares are below 60 at expiration; though a large slide prior could also wipe out the spread's entire worth too. That said, with earnings pegged shortly after the January contract's expiration; risk of that nature appears lessened.

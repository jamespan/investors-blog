With the [stock market in a correction](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-bottom-some-old-faces-now-lead-ibd-50/), it can be challenging to find bullish option trade ideas, but buyers have been pushing **Digital Turbine** ([APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)) higher in recent weeks. APPS stock is looking reasonably healthy, having recently found support around the 200-day moving average.




APPS stock is also trading above the 21-day and 50-day moving averages and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94 from IBD, an [Earnings Per Share](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) Rating of 67 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 87.


The stock is showing accumulation along with an improving [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/a-stock-breakout-specialty-tool-the-relative-strength-line/).


APPS Stock: Bull Put Spread
---------------------------


Traders that expect strength in APPS stock to continue could look at a bull put spread option trade.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Selling the Nov. 19, 60 put and buying the 55 put would create a bull put spread.


This spread was trading for around $1.00 Tuesday. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $100 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $400.


That represents a 25% return on risk between now and Nov. 19 if APPS stock remains above 60.


If Digital Turbine stock closes below 55 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $400.


Break-Even Point
----------------


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 59, which is calculated as 60 less the $1.00 option premium per contract.


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 7 which means it is a similar exposure to owning 7 shares of APPS stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1.00 to $2.50, I would consider closing early for a loss.


With earnings set for early November, this trade could have earnings risk, so keep an eye on that.


Last week, we looked at a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/this-netflix-stock-option-trade-offers-25-potential-return-on-risk/) on **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), which has done very well and can be closed early for nearly a full profit.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

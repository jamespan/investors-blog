IBD 50 constituent and retail paint supplier **Sherwin-Williams**  ([SHW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SHW)) saw some unusually heavy option flow today punctuated by lopsided and concentrated action in a handful of August and September strike puts. In fact, roughly 90% of today's near 9,000 contracts were a result of that same action. While overall the action looks bearish, it isn't the type of paint job we'd necessarily label as entirely crimson red as a couple spreads which can have their deltas obscured by other Greeks, were involved.

  

One of two trades painting the tape and catching our eye today was a August 110 and August 125 ratio put spread put up 850 x 1700 times for about $2.38. With shares near 127.50 and about 2% above the upper strike put, a trader selling the 125s to buy twice as many of the well out-of-the-money 110s would receive the execution price as a credit. If shares remain above the 125 strike at expiration, the credit would be kept as both contracts go out worthless. 

  

Potentially even more profitable, a strong enough move in shares lower and / or a spike in implied volatility could allow for a much larger windfall. Below 110, the position becomes, on an expiration basis, net short the equivalent of 85,000 shares of stock. The bad news is those shades of gray, which fall in between the strikes.

  

  

Ultimately, an unadjusted position at expiration, if shares were to land right at the purchased 110 strike put would be a massive loss just in excess of $1.0 million for this side of the ratio spread. The reason being, the trader's short 125 put would balloon to a parity value of $15 per contract (x 850), while the lower strike protective put would go out completely worthless (1700) and be an ineffectual hedge at that point in time.

  

The ability to profit as shares move lower between the strikes versus seeing a paper and then possibly a real loss come expiration boils down to the speed and size of the movement in the underlying, as well as how cooperative implied volatility might be during that same period. The trader of course and as one might imagine, will would love nothing more than a perfect blend of a crimson red-like, quick outsized move below 110 and implieds gushing green to fresh highs. And if you can't imagine that paint scheme, maybe our visual aid above will help.

One of the more common actions option traders will invariably come across when looking at what the other guy or gal is doing is "the roll." The roll is a broad term used by traders when referring to the process of closing one or more contracts while opening up another position. One simple and very popular type of roll is the calendar spread. 

  

For a trader long a call or put that's about to expire, a spread order which sells that contract to close while buying a further out month 'to open' is the equivalent of entering into a long calendar position. However, unlike a long-calendar position that profits if shares sit on the strike until the near-term contract expires and / or implied volatility expands, the roll is still very much a directional bet on the underlying. 

  

Regardless of whether an open profit exists or not, the trader using this kind of roll is increasing his or her dollar exposure in order to maintain a directional bias on the underlying market. Thus, while the trader has to like the calendar from the standpoint of the price being paid, in the end the position's profit and loss (P&L) at various price levels is very much different from an actual calendar. 

  

How do you tell whose rolling and who might be putting on an actual calendar? Open Interest is one strong clue when a contract approaches expiration. If there's large residing open interest in the near-term contract and much lower levels in the outer month, there's a much stronger likelihood a bear or bull long a put or call is extending their bet out in time versus a trader initiating an actual calendar. 

  

Another factor to consider other than open interest is the skew between contract months as this can reveal positioning clues as well. For instance, when a company is nearing its earnings release there's an increased tendency for abnormal-looking IV skews between the front month contract and options with longer maturities with the shorter-term contract's implieds trading much higher than the back months. 

  

When this situation arises however, the reverse calendar, despite its theoretically frightening skew of "buying high implieds and selling cheaper implieds", is a strategy that could be behind the activity. While it may not make sense on the surface, if a stock has a history of reacting strongly to this sort of catalyst, the reverse or short calendar can turn quickly profitable. That's due to the position's long gamma, short-vega Greek profile, which would allow the credit taken in to shrink in the open market the next day if either bulls or bears in the underlying are grinning from ear-to-ear.

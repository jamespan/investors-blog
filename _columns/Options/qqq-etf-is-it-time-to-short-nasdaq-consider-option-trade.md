The Nasdaq composite's bull run is showing signs of weakness, with the Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) exchange traded fund breaking below the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) on Friday. One trade that could take advantage of further weakness in QQQ over the next week is a bear put spread.




A bear put spread is a debit spread. This means we need to pay the premium in order to open the trade. If we place the bear put spread out of the money, then we have a trade with low cost and a high reward potential if the stock drops.


On QQQ stock, you could set up a bear put spread this way. Use the $245 strike as the long put and the $240 strike as the short put for Aug. 7 expiration.


This trade would cost around $100 per contract with a maximum potential gain of $400.


To achieve the maximum profit, this trade would need QQQ to drop 6.09% between now and expiration on Aug. 7.


QQQ Stock Short Trade: Where A Bear Put Spread Breaks Even
----------------------------------------------------------



The break-even point for the bear put spread is 244. We calculate this by taking 245 less the $1.00 option premium per contract.


If QQQ stock drops early in the trade, it may be possible to make a profit at slightly higher prices.


At expiration, if QQQ stock is trading above 245, the entire spread would expire worthless and the trade would lose 100%, or $100.


For a trade like this, I probably wouldn't bother with a stop loss. Either the trade works or it doesn't. So I would trade an appropriate position size in case I suffered the full 100% loss.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) was added to the SwingTrader portfolio on Aug. 11 with a buy point of 71.78. So, let's look at using options to create a synthetic long stock trade in BLDR stock.




**BLDR Stock: Why Consider This Option Trade?**
-----------------------------------------------


A synthetic long stock trade is a way of taking an equivalent long exposure on a stock without having to put up any capital other than the margin requirement. Construct this strategy selling an at-the-money put and buying an at-the-money call.


Assuming an investor wanted a bullish exposure in BLDR stock via a synthetic long, she or he could sell a 70 put and buy a 70 call.


Recently, the January 2023-expiration monthly put with a 70 strike price traded around $7.65 per contract. The 70 call traded around $9.35.


Therefore, a January synthetic long stock trade would cost just $1.70 per contract, or $170.


**Leverage And Related Risk**
-----------------------------



As the name suggests, this is a synthetic long position. The goal? Now the trader carries similar exposure to owning 100 shares of the underlying stock. That exposure would cost about $7,075 if the investor bought 100 shares.


So, this is effectively a leveraged position and may not be appropriate for every trader.


Even though the option trade only costs $170, the investor could still lose $7,170 if BLDR went to $0.


This synthetic long trade gains an equivalent exposure to owning 100 shares for a lower cost. For this synthetic long position, the margin requirement would be around $2,300, so the investor could use the leverage power of options to trade BLDR stock for less.


Of course, leverage is a double-edged sword, and a falling stock price will magnify losses.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

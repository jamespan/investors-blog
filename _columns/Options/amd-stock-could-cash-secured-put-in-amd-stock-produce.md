In a [prior options trading article](https://www.investors.com/category/research/options/), I mentioned **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) was on my radar. AMD stock has now dropped as much as 19% from its all-time high of 94.28.




Technically, the stock looks a bit weak right now and could drop further. The stock has undercut both its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and its close cousin, the [10-week moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). What I'll be looking to do is sell a March cash secured put with a strike price of 60. But, I'll wait to see if the stock price drops a little further in the short term first.


A cash-secured put involves selling an at-the-money or out-of-the-money [put option](https://www.investors.com/research/options/options-trading-how-to-start-using-options-how-to-manage-risk/) and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock.


AMD Stock Remains A True Leader
-------------------------------


AMD stock is highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 99 and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93. Did I mention AMD also ranks [No. 4 in the IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/)?


The goal is to either have the [put option](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) expire worthless and keep the premium, or to take assignment and acquire the stock below the current price.


The March 19, 2021-expiring 60 strike put for AMD stock recently traded around 3.15. I would love to see the stock drop a bit more in order for that option to be priced around 6.00.


If I'm able to sell the put option for 6, then that would mean a potential return of $600 with $5,400 at risk (strike price multiplied by 100, minus the option premium received).


That represents a potential 11.11% return in 5-1/2 months â€” provided AMD stock stays above 60.

Risk Control
------------



With the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/) looking a little shaky, it makes sense to stick with a standard [CAN SLIM-style stop loss of 7%-8%](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


With the trade risking $5,400 that equates to $380 to $430, so if losses reach that level, I would close the trade.


Let's see what the next few days bring for AMD stock.


Always remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

So, why'd **Green Mountain Coffee Roasters** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) fail to impress investors Thursday, resulting in shares tumbling nearly 40%? Jokes aside that it's K-Cup had a faulty handle construction, bulls hoping for a bargain-hunting opportunity in a recent growth high flyer that was already steeped in the process of corrective activity, were more than a bit upset by the outfit's substantial fourth-quarter sales miss. 

  

The storyline while never identical is one nonetheless often told. It's also played out frequently enough in a similarly bearish manner that by Investor's Business Daily's own admission, most growth stocks eventually shed roughly 70% of their market value when conditions go from hot-to-not or are reduced to simmer. 

  

Often there are signs on our charts to exit a stock in advance of a strong bearish move so that the trader doesn't have to live with the position as it falls technically and fundamentally out of favor. But there are also, in our own opinion, enough incidents where a punishing gap makes a mockery of those tight and best laid plans of exiting, if shares drop 7% to 8% from one's entry point. 

  

In our humble opinion, it doesn't matter if a trader qualifies a purchase of shares as being proper because it broke out on eye candy-pleasing volume from a well-constructed handle, cup or for that matter; a top secret double probation Triple Lindy Bottom. In the end and everywhere in-between, there's nothing between your purchase price and zero theoretically speaking. Well, that's not entirely true.

  

More often than not, realistically there are other options. For one and without having to worry about missing out on spectacular gaps to the upside when they do occur, a trader can marry a put to those shares and enjoy the benefits of a synthetic long call with its open-ended profit potential. As well, a trader could put on a collar position if they're committed to the holding shares. 

  

In our view, the collar is a spread to seriously consider as this vertical equivalent is less predicated on faith and more aligned with real world observations on how to not get crucified when a name falls out of grace unexpectedly. For regular readers, this might sound like a familiar sermon as we discussed similar positioning for the likes of Apple just yesterday. I suppose like other gospels, it's a story that bears repeating.

**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has been punished in the last few days, experiencing one of the worst declines the stock has seen in the last few years.




Yet the stock is [still on Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders) with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 93 and an RS Rating of 95.


So, investors waiting to buy this leader at a discount can now do so. And they can get an even further discount by using options.


Try selling a cash secured put.


A cash-secured put in Apple stock involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


It's important that anyone selling puts understands that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


Apple Stock And A Cash-Secured Put Option
-----------------------------------------


For AAPL stock, a trader selling the Oct. 16-expiring monthly put with a 110 strike price on Tuesday could have generated around $6.80 in premium per contract.


Since then, the put premium has fallen to $4.15 during Wednesday's sizable rebound in the [stock market today](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).



The put seller would have the obligation to purchase 100 shares of AAPL stock at 110 if called upon to do so by the put buyer.


The break-even price for the trade can be calculated by taking the strike price less the premium received. This gives a break-even price of 103.20.


That's an 8.5% discount to Tuesday's closing price.


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if AAPL stock fell to $0, which would see the trade lose $10,320.


The Gain
--------


If the stock stays above 110 at expiry, the put expires worthless leaving the trader with a healthy 6.59% return on capital at risk.


This is calculated by taking the $680 premium received divided by the $10,320 capital at risk.


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls precipitously, the trade will suffer a loss. However, your loss will get partially offset by the premium received for selling the put.


Why Sell Puts In Options Trading?
---------------------------------


Cash secured puts are a fantastic way to generate a nice return on stocks the trader is happy to own.


Sometimes with a trade like this I'll set my order higher than the above-noted price — say $7.50 in this case — and try to generate a bit more premium.


Sometimes the stock drops a bit further, allowing you to get filled at a better price.


Always remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

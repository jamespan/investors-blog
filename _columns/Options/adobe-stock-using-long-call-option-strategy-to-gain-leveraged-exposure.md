Adobe stock continues to be a fantastic choice for growth investors, and the company currently sits in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) as it climbs from support at the 10-week moving average.




**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, an [EPS Rating of 99](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 90. Last week, we looked at [an iron condor trade on Adobe stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/adobe-stock-how-this-option-trade-in-adobe-can-produce-return/), which is a neutral trade, but bullish investors might prefer to trade a long call strategy.


A long call trade is a limited-risk trade with high return potential. Investors would enter this strategy when they have a very bullish view on a stock.


Buying a call gives the investor exposure to 100 shares of the underlying stock for a fraction of the price.


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of Adobe, they would have to invest around $48,850 at the current price.


Instead, the investor could gain the same exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option.



If an investor were to buy one Adobe call option with a 430 strike price expiring in December, they would only need to invest around $7,500 rather than $48,850. If Adobe stock goes to zero, the investor loses only $7,500 while still maintaining a similar exposure to the gains.


Buying Adobe Exposure At A Fraction
-----------------------------------


The Adobe 430 call option gives the investor the right to buy 100 Adobe shares at 430 up until the expiration date.


The call option costs around $75 so the investor would need Adobe stock to rise above 505 (the strike price plus premium paid) to be profitable on the investment.


There is always a risk with trading on leverage like this, of course, and if Adobe drops below 430 at expiration, the investor would lose 100% of the investment, which is the $7,500 premium.


An investor holding 100 shares, on the other hand, would lose around $5,850 or 11.98%.


If Adobe stock dropped below 460, I would rethink the trade or close it early to avoid further losses.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

A good way for investors to beef up their profits is to partake in options trading. Options are advanced tools that can help limit risk while also increasing income. But what is a call option, and why is it useful for the average investor? Read on for the lowdown on call options, and useful information on how they can be used.




David Prosperi, Options Industry Council senior vice president, told Investor's Business Daily there are numerous benefits from options.


"Options, like any other investment product, have certain risks. In the right situations, options can be a powerful way to enhance an investor's strategic investment goals," he said. "Options can be used for many purposes, including downside protection, income opportunities or tactical rebalancing."


An approach highlighted by Investor's Business Daily is to [use options as a strategy to reduce risk around earnings](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/new-option-strategy-limits-risk-around-earnings/). It's a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings, while reducing the downside risk.

What Is A Call Option?
----------------------


A call option is a contract between a buyer and a seller to purchase a stock at an agreed price up until a defined expiration date. The buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the call and buy the stock. The seller must deliver the stock if the option is exercised.


A hypothetical call option contract could give a buyer the right to buy 100 shares of a company for $100 each. In this case $100 is what is referred to as the strike price. Until the option contract expires the option buyer has the right to those shares at that agreed price regardless of the stock market price. Any appreciation above that strike price represents profit for the buyer. If the price shoots up to $150 then the buyer has made a total profit of $5,000, less the cost of the option.


The call option buyer has to pay a fee known as the premium to the seller. In the case above, imagine the premium is $4. This means the premium total of $400 ($4 x 100 shares) would leave a profit of $4,600. However if the stock instead declined in value, the buyer would have no reason to exercise the right to buy the stock for the higher cost. They would more than likely choose to allow the contract to expire and lose the $400. Or they could sell the option if it still has value, to avoid taking a full loss.


But this "full loss" is less than it seems. If you bought the underlying asset itself instead, say 100 shares for $100 each, even a $5 decline would see you lose more money. As this example shows, the option limits the risk.


In addition to the premium, commissions and fees can also add to the overall expense of options trading. That can be sizable.


What Is A Put Option
--------------------


For clarity's sake it is worth mentioning the difference between a call option and a put option. Basically, the latter is the exact opposite of the former. A put option gives the investor the option to sell a stock at an agreed price before or on a specified date. This can be used to protect your stock gains against a fall in price.


"If you are long a stock or an ETF that has risen in value, you may want to protect your gains," the Options Industry Council's Prosperi said. "One way to do so would be by purchasing a put, which is often referenced as similar to insurance."


What Is A Long Call Option?
---------------------------


When you have buy a call option it means you have the right to buy shares. It's referred to as being "long a call." Because a long call costs a fraction of the underlying stock price, there is more potential upside on a percentage basis than buying the underlying security itself.


What Is A Short Call Option?
----------------------------


When you sell a call option you receive payment for the call and are obligated to sell shares of the underlying stock at the strike price until the expiration date. This is also known as writing or being short. While you can create income by selling call options via the premium, there is risk if the stock price rises above the strike price. And given the overall tendency of the stock market to go up, this risk is not insubstantial.


What Is A Covered Call Option?
------------------------------


With short call options, consider the difference between covered and uncovered calls. The latter instrument is also called a naked call.


When your short call is covered, you already own the shares you are obliged to sell. The worst that can happen is that you are forced to sell your stock at a lower price. But even though they are being compensated with the premium, investors can find it tough psychologically if there is a big move in a stock they own when they know they will take none of the gains.


There are several benefits from this options trading approach for people who own stocks.


"In this case, the investor could be collecting income, while also defining an exit price (to sell the underlying at a predetermined price) and simultaneously partly offsetting a decline, should that occur," Prosperi said. "Covered calls can allow investors to lower the cost basis of a long position, since the income received from the sale effectively lowers the acquisition price."


An uncovered short call, or naked call means you are betting on stock you do not even own. Here there is a theoretical potential for unlimited losses.


This is because you are obligated to sell shares. You might have to buy them on the open market at a much higher price and sell them for the lower agreed upon price of the option contract. The difference between those prices can end up being a sizable loss to your account.


What Is Dynamic Leverage In Options Trading?
--------------------------------------------


If you buy an options contract, you have purchased the right to control a number of shares for a fraction of the price of actually buying the shares outright. This is called leverage. As a result, you can participate in the bulk of a stock's move for a lot less money. Called dynamic leverage, it is a powerful way to maximize returns. This means that when you are right, your returns go up at a faster rate.


When you're wrong, your losses are limited to what you paid for the option.


Many investors become bewitched by the hope of high returns due to leverage, only for the spell to be broken because leverage works both ways. For example, when an investor buys an option for $2 per share, a 50-cent gain feels great. It's a 25% return.


But a 50-cent loss will represent a 25% loss. What separates options trading professionals from novices is their ability to plan for and weather losses.


Can You Sell Call Options You Purchased?
----------------------------------------


Yes you can. As a call option owner you have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise your contract. Usually when an investor does not exercise their option they will either choose to let it expire worthless or sell it. This is called "selling to close" your position.


Just like when trading stocks, you can achieve a profit or loss when you sell to close a call option contract. You pay the other party a premium for the right to buy the underlying security when you purchase a call option. When you can sell the contract prior to the option expiration day you can sell it for a premium that is lower or higher than what you originally paid for it. The stock price is not the only factor in play however. Other considerations such as how much time remains until the contract's expiration date affect the price as well.


With Call Options, Time Is Money
--------------------------------


The variety of options contracts to choose from provides investors with flexibility to their risk-managing strategies. Positions can be taken in several time frames that reflect a number of different price moves.


"Depending on the option, you could have a number of expiration dates and strike prices to choose from (which, incidentally, is one of the strengths of options)," Prosperi said. "Options provide choices, and investors can analyze a variety to determine which one best fits the needs of a given portfolio."


But for options investors, time is also a double-edged sword. Options contracts decrease in value at an accelerating rate as they get closer to their expiration date.


How To Profit From Options With IBD's Earnings Options Strategy
---------------------------------------------------------------


A common pitfall is to buy a stock just ahead of its earnings report because it's "acting right." Fundamentals are top notch, there's a compelling growth story, and the stock is in a bullish setup.


Sometimes, the strategy works. Other times, it can end badly, especially if the stock gaps down on earnings. This is where the IBD earnings options strategy comes in.


Remember — while the options market might sound daunting, the strategy itself is not complicated. Weekly or monthly call options can be used, as long as the cost for the option is right. Look for trades with downside risk of 4% or less. This means you will not be paying out excessively on the premium and fees.

Tax Implications Of Options Trading
-----------------------------------


Any investment held for less than 12 months is taxed at the same rate as your other income under the rules for short-term capital gains. Investments held longer than this period fall under the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rules, where the maximum tax rate is 15%.


When it comes to exercised long options, the cost of the option is added to the basis in the stock. The holding period of the stock starts the day after the contract is exercised. This is key. How long you held an option will not affect the holding period of the stock when it comes to capital gains. However at least the net cost of the option can be used to reduce the gain on the stock when the stock is sold.


With short calls, the premium is not taxed when the short position is opened but when it is closed via a purchase or expiration. These transactions are always treated as short term no matter how long the option position remained open.


When it comes to unexercised long options, they are treated as other investments for tax purposes. If the holding period is less than 12 months it is treated as a short-term gain. If the holding period is one year or more it is a long-term gain. Taxes are assessed in the year the long position is closed either from when it is sold or from when it expired.


A (Very) Brief History Of Options Trading
-----------------------------------------


While options trading may seem like a newfangled investment vehicle, it's actually one of the oldest investing concepts. The ancient Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus (624/623 — 548/545 BC) is said to have created what is essentially the first options contract. Convinced a bounteous olive harvest loomed, he paid the owners of olive presses for the right to use them during harvest time. His prediction turned out to be correct, and he made a fortune by selling his olive press rights.


The Japanese created the first fully functional commodities exchange much later, in the 17th century. As the samurai were paid in rice, they wanted to control the rice markets. They ensured they could make a more consistent profit by creating a formal market for buyers and sellers to "barter" for the commodity. The Dojima Rice Exchange was founded in 1697.


Modern, standardized options were not available until the establishment of the Chicago Board of Options Exchange in 1973. The Options Clearing Corporation was set up at the same time. Its purpose was to centralize clearing and ensure the fulfillment of contracts. Today, exchanges list thousands of contracts, with many millions of contracts traded every single day.

Let's say you're bearish but not the kind thinking Armageddon is upon us. One strategy that might fit in with your view on the market moving lower but willing to sacrifice profits if there were a significant fallout heading our way, is a modified directional butterfly using out-of-the money puts. 

  

By designing the two embedded verticals, the closer to the money being the bear put vertical, with either different spread widths between the purchased and sold strikes or by altering the standard +1, -2, +1 construction to maybe something like +1, -3, +2; traders can sometimes come up with a butterfly which might better matches expectations. 

  

Below and to illustrate the former type design where we alter the width of the two verticals, is a bearish but not too bearish 4x May 146P / 140P / 135P modified fly in the **HLDRs Oil Service ETF** ([OIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OIH)). Priced for $1.18 mid market the spread will stand to lose the entire debit come expiration if shares of OIH, currently near $146.75, remain above the upper purchased 146 put.

  

  

The spread will enjoy a nice sized profit of about $4.80 if shares find themselves at the shorted 140-strike come expiration next Friday. Below the shorted middle strike and similar to a regular butterfly, those potential profits are at risk and will begin to drop off point for point with the stock until the lower purchased strike contains the loss. But unlike the regular butterfly, tweaked construction of the wings like this one allow for a much smaller loss. And for some traders this kind of sacrifice might just make some sense when pennies on the dollars are involved.

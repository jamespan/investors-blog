**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is due to report earnings on Thursday after the close, and Amazon stock is currently above the [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and 200-day moving averages.




With a best-possible [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 investors might be hopeful of a positive earnings announcement. On the negative side, however, is a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 77 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of just 34.


Traders who expect a positive earnings result could look at a bull-put spread expiring at the end of this week.


A bull-put spread is a defined-risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull-put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Bullish Amazon Stock Option Trade
---------------------------------


Traders who think Amazon stock will rally or at least not drop by too much could look to sell an April 30-expiring put spread with the short strike at 3,200 and the long strike at 3,195.


On Friday, this spread was trading for around $1.50, which means a trader selling this spread would receive $150 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $350.


That represents a potential 42.86% return on risk in five days as long as AMZN stock remains above 3,200.



If AMZN stock closes below 3,195 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $350.


With this being such a short-term trade, there is no chance to adjust the trade if it goes bad. Trading options over earnings can be risky. For that reason, keeping position size small is a good idea.


The consensus estimate for Amazon earnings is for a profit of $9.65 per share on revenue of $104.41 billion.


The options market is pricing in a 4.47% move in the stock in either direction.


These types of earnings trades are quite risky, so I usually keep position size small.


It's important to remember that options in general are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

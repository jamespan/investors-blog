Within a technically lagging NASDAQ 100 Monday, IBD 50 constituents **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) all saw percentage drops hinting at more trouble ahead with the latter two confirming a failure of the 50-day simple moving average to hold and the former hanging on by a hair and looking prone to a move lower. 

  

The bearish price action wasn't lost on option traders. All three saw well above average contract volume of 250% to nearly 400% above normal and put/call readings near 1 for Baidu and Apple and 1.5 for Priceline. The bulk of Priceline's activity, which amounted to roughly 34,000 total volume, was in the front month and the domain of fast money operators and longer-term traders possibly closing out positions with expiration coming up Friday. 

  

Baidu, traded nearly 115,000 contracts also saw its heaviest volume in the May contract by a wide margin. However, with very decent liquidity provision, June calls and puts did find some fairly strong, albeit none too telling, option action too. And then there was Apple. 

  

The tech giant is mostly in a league by itself most days with Monday no different. More than 400,000 contracts changed hands between openers, closers, bulls, bears and somewhere in-between option hedgehogs. 

  

Monday's heaviest concentrations of activity were the equally traded May 340 call and May 335 put with near identical volume of almost 32,000 apiece. With shares off -2.10% and having a decent sized trading range, your guess is as good as mine as to what traders were doing collectively, if there was any discernable pattern at all. 

  

They or the other guy or gal may have been buying calls and puts to open or close, selling calls in a similar capacity. Implieds were up slightly on the session but given the broader market's own heightened sense of awareness, today's rangy levels don't say much one way or the other. 

  

A couple alternate realities are the risk reversal or strangle as logical choices. The truth though is we're really never going to know for sure what the other guy or gal did. However, one thing is for certain, given lighter levels of existing open interest; the fast and mad money crowd remains alive and well in Apple's options while its shares go from sweet to sour. And on that note, I can't say I blame 'em one bit.

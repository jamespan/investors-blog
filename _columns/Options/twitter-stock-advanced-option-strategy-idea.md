**Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) has been in a nice uptrend lately with a series of higher highs and higher lows. Twitter stock is also above a rising 20-day moving average, which suggests that medium-term momentum is bullish.




With the market looking a little extended here, Twitter might rally a little further, but possibly not too much further.


In situations like this I like to use a diagonal call spread. This is quite an advanced options strategy because it utilizes options over two different expiration periods.


The trade setup I'm looking at is selling a June 26-expiring call with a 37 strike price and buying a July 17 39-strike call.


As of Wednesday's close, the June call could be sold for 82 cents and the July call could be bought for 90 cents.


The net cost on the trade would only be $8, and that is the most the trade would lose on the downside.


The risk on the trade is on the upside with a potential maximum loss of $208. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread and adding in the cost of the trade.


The maximum potential gain is around $90, which would occur if Twitter closes at 37 on June 26.


This trade has only $8 risk on the downside and a nice profit tent between 32 and 38.50.


Aiming for a return of around 10% to 15% makes sense and I would set a similar stop loss.

This is an advanced option strategy so is not recommended for beginners.

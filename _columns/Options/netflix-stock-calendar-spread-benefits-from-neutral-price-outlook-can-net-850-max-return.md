A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.




Usually this is done with monthly options, but it can also be done with weekly options. Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias. In that case they would use puts.


In today's example, we'll look at a calendar spread trade on **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stock.


With Netflix trading around 360, setting up a calendar spread at 360 gives the trade a neutral outlook.


Selling the Feb. 17 expiry, 360-strike put option will generate around $1,390 in premium. And buying the March 17, 360-strike put will cost around $2,120.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $730 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.


Estimated Maximum Profit $850
-----------------------------


The estimated maximum profit is $850. But that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility. 


The idea with the trade is that if Netflix stock remains around 360 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay at a faster rate than the bought option, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 340 and 385, but these can also change slightly depending on the impact of changes in implied volatility.


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.



For a trade like this I would set a profit target of 20%, and I would set a stop loss if Netflix stock breaks through either 340 or 385.


Limit Risk With Netflix Stock Calendar Spread
---------------------------------------------


For a trade like this I would risk not more than 2%-3% of my capital. 


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Netflix stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 93, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 69 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 95.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

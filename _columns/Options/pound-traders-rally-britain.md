  Pound Traders Are Gearing Up For A Bigger Rally

Pound traders are gearing up for the pound to extend a rally as they cut the chances Tuesday of a no-deal Brexit scenario.


The market's positioning is short on the pound, leading to the risk of a spike higher if traders are forced to unwind their bets against the U.K. currency following this week's Brexit votes in Parliament. Demand for hedging has lifted a gauge of expected swings in sterling to the highest point since a U.K. election in 2017, and signals the possibility of new 2019 highs being hit.


Options models show a 12% likelihood of a rally to $1.40 within a month, a level last seen in April. That compares to just a 0.6% chance of a plunge to $1.20. Technically, chart indicators show bulls are in control, adding further evidence to the potential for gains.


Bloomberg data suggests that the pound could test the year-to-date high hit on Feb. 27 at $1.3350.


One-week risk reversals, a gauge of sentiment and positioning in options, are trading near parity as investors see a Brexit delay as the most likely scenario if May loses Tuesday's vote on her revised deal. The vote is expected at 3 p.m. ET.

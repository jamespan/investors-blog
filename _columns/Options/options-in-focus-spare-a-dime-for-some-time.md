Spreads such as the bull call vertical can be a great way to reduce the cost of directional position versus an outright purchase. So, what if you use that advantage coupled with the extra time associated with a longer-dated contract which might cost maybe a nickel or dime more or even less money than the closer in vertical? Well, before you decide to rush out and buy into this type position for what quite often looks like a bargain compared to a vertical nearer to expiration; do remember you really do pay for that time in more than one way.

  

Bottom-line, the longer out in time one goes, the more difficult it is to see an option's extrinsic or time value drop off completely. And for a spread like a bull vertical this means its ability to expand towards its maximum worth prior to expiration is very difficult barring a significant move well beyond the higher short strike.

  

As much, traders need to be aware of this potential negative characteristic with longer-term verticals. If a trader is overly fixated on how much more time he or she might have to remain in the position for just a tiny bit more capital or perhaps even a discount; there could be some unintended results of feeling cheated if the stock cooperates a bit faster than planned.

  

  

To illustrate let's look at situation in the **iShares Silver**  ([SLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLV)) product comparing 10x May 31 / 33 bull call spreads versus 10x July 31 / 33 verticals with shares near $30.60. The former and near-term spread is currently priced at $0.61, while the latter July vertical with its extra 63 days on the calendar cost just a bit more than a dime for $0.73 per spread. That sounds quite reasonable, right? So what gives?

  

Well if a picture can speak a thousand words, we hope when you look above at the comparison of the two spreads you can conclude why basically a dime for your time could be a costly one or at least a bit aggravating at times. For instance, if shares jumped sharply and quickly by 11% to $34, the difference in profits of $500 versus $800 or so is 60%. In the end or at least the interim between spreads; if the vertical trader doesn't appreciate the negative aspect of time remaining until expiration, the difference in the here and now can prove disappointing should that bull move faster and more aggressively than expected.

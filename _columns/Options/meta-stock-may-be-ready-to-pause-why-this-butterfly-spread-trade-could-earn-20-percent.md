**Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) has bounced nicely off the recent lows near 186. So today I want to look at an options trade in Meta stock that could benefit from neutral price action over the next month.




After a strong run in the short term, [Meta stock](https://www.investors.com/research/fb-stock-buy-now-facebook-stock/) is possibly due for a pause. Given that FB stock has acted strongly during prior bull-market runs, I can't see it pulling back too much. I'm expecting sideways action. As such, I would look at entering a [butterfly trade](https://www.investors.com/videos/9-iron-butterfly/) for the April expiration period.


A butterfly is a neutral, income-oriented strategy.  It is a limited-risk and limited-profit trade, but on a typical butterfly trade the profit potential runs higher than the potential loss.


Meta Stock Today: How To Build A Butterfly Spread
-------------------------------------------------



Butterfly spreads involve three different option strike prices, all within the same expiration date, and can be created using either calls or puts.


Construct a typical butterfly as follows:


* Buy one in-the-money call
* Sell two at-the-money calls
* Buy one out-of-the-money call


Let's take a look at how that might look on FB stock.


* Buy one April 14 200 call at 19.40
* Sell two April 14 220 calls at 6.45
* Buy one April 14 240 call at 1.30


The total cost of this trade? $780, and this counts as the maximum loss potential.


These options expire on a Thursday during the week of April 11, since April 15, or Good Friday, is a market holiday.


Reward Vs. Risk
---------------



The maximum gain is $1,220; calculate that by taking the difference in strike prices less the premium paid ($2,000 less $780).


The break-even prices are 207.80 and 232.20 (lower strike plus the premium and upper strike minus the premium).


A butterfly options trade has a tentlike shape with the potential for very large profits around the short strike. Keep in mind that it's unlikely you would ever achieve the maximum profit.


A good aim for a butterfly trade, even with Meta stock, is a 20% return on capital at risk. In this case that would be around $155.


Butterfly spreads can be a bit confusing for beginners, so it's best to paper-trade this way and see how it performs.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Meta stock ranks No. 7 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 55, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 84 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 14.


FB stock currently trades above its 21-day exponential moving average, but below the 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

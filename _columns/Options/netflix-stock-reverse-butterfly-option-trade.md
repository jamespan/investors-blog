Netflix stock has decisively broken below the 21-day and 50-day moving averages and today I want to analyze a reverse butterfly option trade.




A reverse butterfly would be constructed as follows:


* Sell one in-the-money call.
* Buy two at-the-money calls.
* Sell one out-of-the-money call.


The trade will benefit from a big move in either direction from **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stock.


Let's take a look at how that might look on Netflix stock as of last week.


* Buy one Oct. 16-expiration call with 460 strike price at $44.75.
* Sell two Oct. 16 480 calls at $33.65.
* Buy one Oct. 16 500 call at $25.05.


In total, the trade would have cost $250 in premium with a maximum risk of $1,750.



What the trade is looking for is a quick price move in either direction. The trade loses value each day through time decay while Netflix stock remains between the break-even points of 462.50 and 497.50.


Netflix Stock Option Trade Loss Limit
-------------------------------------


For a trade like this I would set a stock loss of 20%, which is around $300.


A reverse butterfly is a nonstandard option trade and therefore not recommended for beginners.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

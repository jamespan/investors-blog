IBD 50 constituent and the market's undisputed capitalization heavyweight **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) saw massive option activity Wednesday as shares trade higher by about 3.50%. With less than 30 minutes to go, nearly 1.9 million contracts have changed hands in swelling volume in excess of six times its typically massive daily tally of 277,000. 

  

Goading stock bulls into action today, in part at least, Apple received a pair of wildly large target lifts from the low 500s to low 700s from both Morgan Stanley and Canaccord. Option traders of course, were also likely inspired to some extent by the bullish analyst moves and reaction in stock.

  

However, as a group, with a put/call of 0.65 and implieds across-the-board hitting fifty-plus day highs into the low and mid-30s and now some 50% to 70% above the stock's statistical volatility, the behavior is a sure sign of a less confident investor acting aggressively to secure protection. 

  

The phenomenon of buying premium for option-based strategies to limit one's risk after such an extended and rather fast linear run to all-time highs isn't entirely surprising. While most investors associate high volatility with markets in a decline, strong and unchecked gains are statistically just as volatile, despite what happy shareholders might have to say on those matters. 

  

Also, despite a good deal of the overall volume i.e. "Apple Turnover" was tied to the March contract which expires Friday, the strong bid in implieds was well-traded in both April and May and even saw impressive pockets of activity as far out as next January. All told and given the VIX's lowly five-year lows and complacent behavior struck this week; a less heralded leadership from Apple not related to beefing up the market, might be appreciated as making sense and likely better cents and dollars in one's own portfolio.

More than a few stock bulls got it wrong in **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) by Investor's Business Daily's own reckoning. Their own pre-report analysis discussed a big ol' "D" Distribution Rating and a less-than-stellar, lighter volume handle breakout attempt from last week within a described late stage base. 

  

Personally, toss in the fact shares had gained about 900% over the past two years; and this corner can't fault having been less than bullish on the name. One group of bulls though that got it right while defying the odds, were premium buyers or net long, delta neutral option contract holders. 

  

Yesterday afternoon in front of Baidu's results, we discussed the pricing of the then at-the-money weekly February 105 / 110 strangle. The mostly delta neutral strategy had just four days until expiration. As much, the strangle spread was Baidu's purest means to calculating trader opinion as far as a post earnings reaction in shares were concerned. 

  

Priced at roughly 87% IV when I wrote the piece, the math equated to traders expecting a 68% or 1 standard deviation [SD] chance BIDU shares would remain contained between 99 and 118 or an estimated move of 9% through Friday. But, with shares up "just" (using that word lightly) 8.1% near 117.45, the long strangle was showing a deep call-like profit of $1.70 per contract with the Feb 110 call trading for roughly $7.55 and the 105 put essentially worthless. 

  

So, what gives? And should we feel sorry for the likely market makers on the other side holding an assumed short strangle? Probably not. While a seemingly smaller-than-expected move has produced a loss for an unhedged short strangle position, the price gap wasn't so severe as to not allow for those theoretically-oriented pros to buy in stock near the opening price or better yet, closer to the slightly lower session lows of 115.10. 

  

The likely reality is as the call approached close to 100 deltas out-the-gate, covering built up short deltas (compliments of the unwanted price gap) between 115.10 and somewhere south of 117 (with the opening price sandwiched in-between) made sense, albeit far from any added cents. That said, while the price action has been far from ideal for short strangle traders, by acting in this capacity, theoretical pricing has been replaced by a more or less breakeven result to a rather small loss all things considered and the ability to fight another more likely profitable day.

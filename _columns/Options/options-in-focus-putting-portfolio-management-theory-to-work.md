For traders with growth stock portfolios and possibly in names which have less-than-adequate put and call liquidity, the choice of portfolio protection, other than a stop-loss, may seem out of reach or even out of the question. However, real protection is available indirectly if one looks to the broader market for help. By finding the overall portfolio dollar exposure to the broader market using the systemic risk measure known as beta, a trader can then look to an instrument such as the S&P 500 and its very liquid options to hedge the portfolio with the proper amount of insurance with a simple long put position.

  

"What's beta you ask?" Beta is a measure of how a stock moves in relation to the broader market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock in question has a history of tracking the market in percent terms, both up and down. One name typically very much in-sync or in-tune with the daily ups and downs of the major averages is computer device goliath **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Unsurprisingly, in large part due to its size as the world's largest market capitalization stock, it's typically well-correlated movement relative to the likes of the S&P 500 sports a beta of 0.87.

  

The beta value can be found on Yahoo! Finance under a stock's "Key Statistics" page. Readings well-below 1.0, like with many utilities names are less volatile. Stocks which have beta values greater than 1.0, as one might expect to find with growth stocks, generally see greater percent swings up and down compared to the broader market. For instance and from today's "Small-Cap Leaders" screen at Investors.com, niche retailer **Zumiez** ([ZUMZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZUMZ)) currently has a beta of 2.20, which implies its 220% more volatile in percent terms than the S&P 500. Thus if the index dropped 1.0%, we'd expect ZUMZ to be down a stiffer 2.20% to keep the relationship intact.

  

While a bit more complicated and such an index hedging strategy doesn't guard against company-specific risks, such as **Questcor Pharmaceuticals**  ([QCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOR)) recent technical fall from grace, it does guard against broader market risk and is an alternative to simply having a stop loss with no steadfast guarantees of getting filled near one's ideal exit point. So, how's it done? Let's say you have $50K in four growth stocks and each one has a beta of 2.00. In order to make an effective put hedge for this portfolio's real market exposure, the trader would multiply the dollar risk of $50K by the beta of 2.00. The resulting figure of $100K is the portfolio's Beta value or risk exposure and the amount the trader would want to hedge. 

  

Using the **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) and shares back at their April highs near 142, one purchased at-the-money put contract is the equivalent of $14,200 in protection, minus the cost of the put itself, which provides this type of portfolio security. Thus, for a portfolio with a Beta value or risk exposure of $100K, the trader could purchase 7 contracts to come up with a simple yet effective hedge that covers, in theory at least, nearly 100% of the systemic market risk ($14,200 x 7 = $99,400) embedded in the portfolio. 

  

Based on the VIX and whose pricing reflects the cost of buying contracts such as the protective put, looks affordable. Currently, the euphemistically called "Fear Gauge" is just removed from the March lows of 13.66% and five year lows and suggesting the greater fear by investors is that of missing out. What's more, with traders having the opportunity to let a simple long put strategy protect a portfolio with short-term Weeklys, Quarterlies or regular monthly contracts in the S&P 500, the decision to look at this kind of portfolio insurance becomes more attractive for a diverse but similar group of traders always looking to manage risk more effectively.

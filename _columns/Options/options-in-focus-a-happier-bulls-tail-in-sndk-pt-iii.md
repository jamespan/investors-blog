This past Friday we compared the merits of maintaining an out-of-the money call calendar in **SanDisk** ([SNDK](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SNDK)) versus closing out the shorted front month after collecting more than 65% of its premium for a price of $0.33 per contract. 

  

The second and favored long call adjustment had the trader holding February 55 calls with slightly more total dollar risk at stake but timing the adjustment to a multi-day pullback and with an appreciative eye on the possibility of a bullish pop for the market to start the New Year. 

  

It turns out the latter strategy with its stiffer long delta count was rewarded as shares of SNDK tacked in about 2.75% in late trade Monday. With open paper profits of $220 or $0.55 per contract on +4 February 55 calls and ever mindful of rewarding ourselves when the market does cooperate, I like the idea of adjusting once again.

  

  

With our latest mused adjustment, the idea is to reduce risk below the initial long calendar after having increased it slightly on Friday while still holding a net long call position in case shares actually manufacture a bonafide breakout. 

  

One simple adjustment which cuts the open position risk from $560 to $170 would be to sell one-half of the calls or in this case, two February 55 calls priced at $1.95 per contract intraday. 

  

A second adjustment looked at this afternoon cuts the existing risk from $560 down to $305 by selling 3 February 60 calls for $0.85 per contract. While there's greater downside risk with this particular adjustment, it does outperform the simple (reduced) long call strategy by a comfortable enough margin for up to a 30% rally in shares of SNDK before seeing lesser gains per point move up. 

  

For the moment and still liking the prospects of additional upside, I like the second adjustment a bit more. Ultimately, it's construction of net +1 Feb call and 3 bull call spreads does the job of reducing downside risk nicely, while being in better position to profit if business as usual means anything less than a swift 30% climb in shares where adjustments might not be possible. 

  

Personally, I'd say that's a risk worth taking, particularly so if like last time, the trader looks to use a managed stop loss if shares begin to be uncooperative. In my eyes, I'd say that Friday's closing price would be a fair enough technical line in the sand to either exit or adjust further into a less bullish position. What do you think?

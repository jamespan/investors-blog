**Panera Bread**  ([PNRA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PNRA)) saw some piping-hot technical action and option activity Wednesday. With shares up about 4.5% on well above-average volume, PNRA managed a successful handle breakout through a pivot of 164.10 within a corrective cup-shaped base of about 22% in depth. 

  

Looking at Panera's calls and puts, traders jumped in with both hands on volume of about 9,500 representing a near 10-fold increase over its 50-day average. Calls were favored by a margin of 1.75-to-1.0. 

  

Implieds, which have been trading near two-plus month lows, popped 10% to 20% in the front couple contract months, suggesting buyers entering the fray. Despite the bid, premiums remain attractive overall as implieds remain parked in the bottom 20% of their 52-week range and priced around the underlying's statistical movement. 

  

Individual markets remain loose enough that trading beyond the November contract carries the extra baggage of execution risk. With the potential negative compounding costs in both entering and closing positions investors might consider keeping any spreads or even outrights for that matter; to September, October or November. 

  

  

One type spread which is moderately bullish near-term with the potential to expand rapidly and which carries stock risk of under 1.0% is a long September 165 / 170 / 175 call butterfly. Conservatively, i.e. more realistically priced above its mid-market value for $1.35 with shares at 166.53, the limited risk spread is narrowly above its breakeven level at expiration next Friday. At the same time, the spread maintains a range of profitability from 166.35 to 173.65. 

  

Optimistically, this fly could expand to $5.00 if shares were to rally by just more than 2.0% to 170 and finish right at the spread's sweet spot right on expiration. Were that to occur, theoretically the stock action would net the trader $3.65 in seven trading sessions or 270%. Again and being more practical minded, to exit that kind of perfect landing would probably only allow for a profit of $3.00 to $3.20 in order to close down the position without worrying about assignment risks on the short contracts maintained on the 170 strike. 

  

Without recognizing that those potentially worthless contracts could come home to ruse by forcing the butterfly trader into an unexpected short stock position, the reality is some rising dough in the trading account could quickly turn into a less well-baked situation without the safeguards of protection in place.

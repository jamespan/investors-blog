If your rules dictate a stock is technically "well-extended" past any semblance of a proper entry, does that mean existing bulls need to take jump ship, take partial profits or something else entirely? 

  

Truthfully, there may not be a definitive one size fits all answer. However, if that stock is IBD 50 constituent **Questcor Pharmaceutical** ([QCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOR)), approaching those listed calls and puts for alternative strategies is certainly something to consider when looking to reign in risk and protect open profits. 

  

Shares of QCOR are now roughly 23% above its last weekly base buy point after a salacious-looking breakout Monday from a short daily pullback pattern tied to upbeat preliminary operations data. 

  

Tempting as today's high volume action may be, with the bigger picture showing a pivot of $46.94 compared to a current price near $57.25, still loose, but decently-traded option markets can substantially cut down and even eliminate risk and still allow for upside potential that's simply not possible with shares tethered to a stop loss. 

  

For an existing shareholder that seeks to retain ownership of QCOR, a bearish risk reversal is a strategy to consider. The bearish risk reversal buys a put and simultaneously sells a higher strike call to finance the position, which will operate like short stock below the purchased put at expiration. 

  

For a bull already long shares and in this case, with very nice sized paper profits, this bearish adjustment turns the position into what's known as a "collar." 

  

By adding long stock to the risk reversal the trader maintains a synthetic long call which is hedged by a higher strike short call. The limited risk position ensures the trader unequivocally, how much dollar risk is at stake. And while profits are now limited on the upside, the possibility for future adjustments can improve on those gains too.

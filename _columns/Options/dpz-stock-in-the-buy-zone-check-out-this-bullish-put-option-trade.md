**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) stock is currently on the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as a Leader near a [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) with the buy range of 387.95 to 407.35. DPZ stock has a Composite Rating of 88, an EPS Rating of 99 and an RS Rating of 85.




The bulls took control late on Friday with Domino's stock bouncing right at the 50-day moving average.


For Domino's stock, I'll be looking at a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/bull-put-spreads-2/) this week. Bull put spreads are defined risk trades that profit if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**DPZ Stock Bullish Option Trade**
----------------------------------


With Domino's stock closing at 389.12 on Friday, it makes sense to place the bull put spread around 370.


Selling a Sept. 18-expiring 370 put option and buying the 360 put option would generate around $295 in premium per contract, based on Friday's closing prices.


This trade offers a 42% return potential in one and a half months, provided DPZ closes above 370 at expiration.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $295 per contract with a maximum risk of $705.


The spread would achieve the maximum profit if DPZ stock closes above 370 on September 18, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless allowing the premium seller to keep the $295 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if DPZ closes below 360 on September 18, which would see the premium seller lose $705 on the trade.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 367.05 which can be calculated as 370 less the $2.95 option premium per contract.


**Set A Stop Loss Here**
------------------------



Looking at the chart, I would rethink or close the trade if DPZ stock closed below 375.


Sticking to this stop loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

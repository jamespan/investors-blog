One of the great characteristics of trading options rather than simply holding stock is how a trader can profit where none would be possible with stock. One strategy which, can take advantage of this feature with the proper design of strikes, is the in-the-money bull call vertical. 

  

The in-the-money bull call vertical, as with any call vertical, is comprised of a lower purchased strike call and a sold or shorted higher strike call, which is also in, at or near-the-money. This selection of strikes in relation to shares allows the trader to profit if shares wind up sitting rather than going up. 

  

The reason a profit is possible versus a loss for an "at" or out-of-the money vertical is due to the sold call's larger extrinsic premium relative to the deeper purchased strike. While that call will be worth more in dollar terms, the extrinsic or time value will always be smaller. This relationship means the shorted call's time decay will be greater than what's lost (if any) on the long call tied to extrinsic premium.

  

At the end of the day or more correctly, at expiration, this type spread will expand in value to the distance between the two calls if shares are above both strikes. All extrinsic value will have been removed from each contract's price, which will be comprised entirely of intrinsic value as the option becomes a stock equivalent and typically converted into actual shares. 

  

The profit at that point in time would simply be the difference in strikes minus the initial purchase price. For example if the venerable XYZ Corp (XYZ) was at $56 a month ago when a trader purchased the March 50 / 55 call vertical for $4.00 and shares found themselves still at $56 at expiration, the trader would realize a $1.00 profit. 

  

As for the basic risks, this position is viewed as one, which has a higher likelihood of being profitable. But with that likelihood the trader accepts smaller gains compared to the position's max risk exposure. If you find a situation, which allows for larger gains and higher probability of profits relative to other strategies, we'd like to hear from you. Failing that, traders of this type vertical or the equivalent bull put spread, do need to be aware of those lesser probabilities as the risk on a contract basis are also increased. 

  

In the more pleasant situation where both options are fully in-the-money by a good amount well before expiration, it's a wise policy to close the position if it only means giving up a few pennies versus waiting on the maximum return but taking on the risk of additional time which could turn profits into losses.

  

In the rare situation the call spread is assigned on the higher positioned short strike prior to expiration, the trader might consider keeping the adjusted synthetic put on (short stock and long call) rather than exercising the long call still owned. At that point, the trader has locked in the maximum profit (strikes minus debit) and stands to enjoy additional gains if that often enough, mad money market decides to rear its head and put value into the trader's freebie synthetic.

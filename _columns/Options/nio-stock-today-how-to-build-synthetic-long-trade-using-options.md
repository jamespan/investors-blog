**Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) has quietly been putting in a series of higher highs and higher lows. Nio stock is showing a much-improved Relative Strength Rating (currently 97), although its Composite Rating is only 63 and its Earnings Per Share Rating a mediocre 50.




Today, I want to look at using options to create a synthetic long stock trade in Nio stock.


A synthetic long stock trade is a way of taking an equivalent long exposure on a stock without having to put up any capital other than the margin requirement.


You can construct the strategy by selling an at-the-money put and buying an at-the-money call.

Let's look at Nio stock as an example.


Building The Synthetic Long Trade In Nio Stock
----------------------------------------------



Assuming an investor wanted a bullish exposure via a synthetic long, he or she could sell a 50 put and buy a 50 call.


Currently, the January-expiration 50 put is trading around $9.40, and the 50 call is trading around $9.90. Therefore, a January synthetic long stock trade would cost just $0.50 per contract, or $50.


As the name suggests, this is a synthetic long position. So the trader has a similar exposure to owning 100 shares of the underlying stock. That exposure would cost about $5,100 if the investor bought 100 shares at 51 per share.


The Downside Risk
-----------------


So, this is effectively a leveraged position. It may not be appropriate for every trader.


Even though the option trade only costs $50, the investor could still lose $5,050 if Nio stock went to $0.


This synthetic long trade gains an equivalent exposure to owning 100 shares for a lower cost. For this synthetic long position, the margin requirement would be around $3,600, so the investor could use the leverage power of options to trade NIO for less.


Of course, leverage is a double-edged sword, and a falling stock price will magnify losses.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

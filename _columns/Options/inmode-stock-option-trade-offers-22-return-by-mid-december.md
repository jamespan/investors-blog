**InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) is currently No. 1 in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), as shares trade tightly near new highs.




The company is also ranked No. 1 in the medical systems and equipment group and is showing a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99. 


InMode shares are trading near another record high as the company [prepares to launch a new product](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/inmode-stock-will-the-aesthetics-workhorse-keep-its-bullish-growth-streak-alive/) within a few months. 


Traders who expect strength in InMode stock to continue could look at a bull put spread option trade. 


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. 


Selling the December-expiring, 80-strike put and buying the 75 put would create a bull put spread. 


Trade Receives $90 In Premium For InMode Stock
----------------------------------------------


This spread was trading on Friday for around 90 cents a share. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $90 in option premium for a 100-share block, and would have a maximum risk of $410. 


That represents a 22% return on risk between now and Dec. 17 if InMode stock remains above 175. 


If INMD closes below 80 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $410. 


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 79.10, which is calculated as 80 less the 90-cent option premium per contract.


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 7, which means it is a similar exposure to owning seven shares of InMode stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves. 


Stop Loss Limit For Option Trade
--------------------------------


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from 90 cents to $1.80, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


With Q3 earnings already released, this trade should have no earnings risk. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

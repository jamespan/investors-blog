The ability to structure positions in numerous ways is one unique feature of options. With stock, a trader is either bullish or bearish and he or she needs the chosen security to go either up or down respectively, in order to turn a profit. 

  

On the other hand, an option trader can be bullish or bearish but they can also chose whether or not they need to see the underlying actually move in that direction in order to profit or not. How so you ask? One easy comparison is to look at an "at" or out-of-the-money long bear put spread versus an "at" or out-of-the money bear call spread. 

  

In the former put vertical, our resident bear would need shares of the underlying to move lower before the spread might appreciate in value above what was paid for it. Conversely, if that same trader is bearish but decides to sell the similarly positioned bear call spread, the stock in question can sit and possibly even go up and a profit might still be possible. 

  

The big difference in choosing one or the other has to do with the actual pricing or risk-to-reward and mathematical probabilities involved. Being a bear with the call spread is easier to land a profit but those gains will be smaller and the potential losses larger than if one were to buy the bear put spread. 

  

Is there an advantage to one over the other? Premium sellers would have you believe the bear call spread is better but the reality is if there were a tradable edge to the one over the other, it would disappear as market makers and other pros would be all over it like flies on a rib roast until it was arbitraged out...and that's no bull.

When looking for bearish option trade candidates, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is one stock that might fit the bill.




On Wednesday, Amazon stock closed near the low of the day and broke below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).


That type of action could spell more downside for the stock. Assuming traders have a price target of 85 for Amazon stock, they could look at a bearish calendar at that strike price.


A bearish calendar is negative delta and positive vega, so can do quite well when the stock drops.


Trade Uses Short-Term, Longer-Term Options
------------------------------------------



A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they would use puts.


Let's take a look at an example of a bearish calendar spread on Amazon stock.


Based on Wednesday's closing prices, traders could sell the March 17, 85 strike put for around $0.75, then buy the March 31, 85 strike put for around $1.45.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $70 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.


Maximum Profit Of $200
----------------------


The estimated maximum profit is around $200, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.

The idea with the trade is that if AMZN trades down around 85 in the next few weeks, the calendar spread will increase in value. That allows the trade to be closed for a profit.


The position starts with a delta of -6, meaning the exposure is roughly equivalent to being short six shares of Amazon. But this will change as the trade progresses.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Amazon stock is ranked No. 16 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 27, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 13 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 16.

According to Investor's Business Daily in a New America piece from a week ago, **Fortinet** ([FTNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FTNT)) is the "top firm in the growing unified threat management, or UTM, market." The irony is that reputation for excellence hasn't kept its price chart out of harm's way with **Oracle**'s ([ORCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ORCL)) weak business outlook triggering another security breach of sorts for bulls in the name. 

  

Despite the broader market's own move Tuesday from a proverbial code red "Market in Correction" situation to a jollier "Confirmed Uptrend", shares of FTNT have gone from leading the market with its recent well-constructed cup-with-handle breakout back on December 5 to sliding a rough and tumble 30% thereabouts below its buy point when including today's slippery 10% dip that's lost 200-day simple moving average support.

  

When might Fortinet make a comeback befitting of growth traders? We don't portend to know definitively, but looking at the weekly chart it could take a little while. That's based on a visual technical guesstimate of a larger high level double bottom being the most likely candidate to emerge and then eventually enable bulls enamored by breakouts, to get back to work. 

  

For bulls that like to manage softer delta, limited risk positions and maybe don't mind the position of buying into price weakness with an eye on longer-term value; one big gift is Fortinet's options.

  

Despite the company having only debuted as a publicly traded stock back in late 2009, Fortinet sports overall good liquidity measures in its options. To me, that's the best sort of "UTM" or unified threat management for bulls and a condition which might allow some traders to consider the option to collar today's mean ol' bears a bit more dynamically than otherwise.

  

Shown above and to illustrate what's possible is a 5x January 19 / 21 collar priced with shares of FTNT near 19.50. Margin for this type commitment is about $5K, while roughly $10K is required in a cash account. The reward on this particular collar is about 2.7% and the risk is 2.3%, so realistically a push of sorts. However, if today's nasty push becomes a great big shove lower, this trader, unlike his solo stock trading counterpart, is likely to be in a much stronger position to accumulate on weakness given much smaller and contained losses.

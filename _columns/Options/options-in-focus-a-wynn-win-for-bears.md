As quickly as the CBOE Volatility Index reclaimed the long dormant status of being a fear gauge, "Poof." In Monday's session the VIX saw continued selling pressure of option premiums from investors, whose collective risk appetites where whetted by positive developments on the M&A front, Japan and even military escalations in Libya, as war has historically proven to be a boon for bulls. 

  

That said, three days into a rally that's lifted the S&P 500 some 3.5% off its lows, filled a bearish gap and finds itself underneath key 50-day simple moving average and 1300 level resistance. Bears and maybe bulls looking for a better spot to protect their portfolios can look towards the long put strategy with more confidence. 

  

There are no guarantees of profits and who knows, in this game of March Madness a follow-through day could trigger as soon as tomorrow. However, if you like defined risk, technicals in your favor and fairly cheap premiums given the backdrop in volatility and historical prices, there's much less reason to feel like the mad money going forward if you take the step to use the protective qualities sometimes afforded by options, when they're available.

  

  

Shown above and illustrating a better-priced bear at resistance, is a two-lot at-the-money April 120 put in Wynn Resorts ([WYNN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WYNN)), a name which found itself atop the Percentage Leaders board Monday on the Nasdaq 100. The casino operator racked up gains of 4.6% but the stock is now in the less glamorous position of testing 50-day simple moving average resistance. 

  

Priced at $3.80, a two-lot position is nearing 4% risk on a model $20K portfolio. That may be a bit much compared to the 2% to 3% many investors see as suitable. However, far from having to roll the dice and letting the game play out without manmade interference, this trader does have the choice to manage and control their losses to a lesser percentage. And even in a game where the house doesn't rule, that still sounds like a good bet to play consistently and a "Wynn, Win for bears."

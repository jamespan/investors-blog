**Shift4** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) was Friday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/four-stock-recession-risk-versus-possible-musk-upside/) and is showing excellent relative strength as it tries to form a new base.




According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), FOUR stock is ranked No. 2 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 93, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 74 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90.


Investors who think FOUR stock will continue to rally and don't want to risk significant capital can use long call options rather than buy the stock outright. This can be a good way to protect precious capital while the market [uptrend is under pressure](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/).


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (strike price) up until a certain date (expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage (which can be both a good and a bad thing depending how the trade plays out).


$5,400 Vs. $1,910 To Invest In The Stock
----------------------------------------


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of Shift4, he or she would have to invest around $5,400 at Friday's closing share price.


Instead, the investor could gain a similar exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option. One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.



If investors were to buy one 40-strike call option on FOUR stock expiring on July 21, they would only need to invest around $1,910 rather than $5,400. 


The break-even price for this call option is equal to the strike price plus the premium paid, which would make the break-even price 59.10.


The most the trade can lose is the premium paid of $1,910, which would occur if Shift4 finished below 40 on July 21.


Unlimited Upside With Call Option
---------------------------------


However, if FOUR stock shoots higher, the upside is unlimited.


Using options in this way can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock without risking as much capital as would be required to buy the stock outright.


Savvy traders can further reduce the risk by selling an out-of-the-money call, turning the trade into a bull call spread.


For example, selling the July 21, 70 call would reduce the trade cost by around $570 but would also limit the upside above 70.


A stop loss could be set if FOUR stock drops 8% from the entry point.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

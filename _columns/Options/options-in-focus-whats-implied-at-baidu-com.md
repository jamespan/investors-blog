In front of tonight's earnings report from Chinese Internet search giant **Baidu.com** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and entering the final hour of trade, option traders have been busy as net buyers of the weekly February contract. With just four sessions remaining in its life, those calls and puts are the closest instruments that bulls, bears and option hedge hogs have as far as an earnings pure play. 

  

At-the-money implied volatility of about 87%, averaged using the surrounding money 105 and 110 strikes implies, pardon the pun, traders are expecting a move of no more than roughly 9% through expiration. A figure of 9% can be obtained from the following:

  

365 calendar days / 4 days to expiration = 91.25. Take the square root: âˆš91.25 = 9.55. Divide implied volatility by 9.55: 87 / 9.55 = 9.10% estimated move up or down. 

  

This number is essentially the same as traders stating, with their collective wallets, they believe there is a 1 Standard Deviation [SD] or 68% chance shares will remain roughly between 99 and 118 through Friday. 

  

Realistically, the formula means more to hedged market professionals such as market makers as those traders are typically the ones doing the bulk of the short premium risk taking. As much, if an outsized move occurs, they're the ones with the potentially difficult task of working their way out of an earnings-related hole due to short curvature / gamma positions. 

  

The short straddle is the simplest of these positions. In effect, the higher shares go the shorter the position becomes and one, at some point, that will need to be covered for a potential loss. The inverse is true on the downside, wherein the short straddle continues to build up its long delta. 

  

  

So, why take the risk? Because, these traders know that outside of an abnormally large reaction in shares, inflated premiums, which should fall 50% to 55% due to tomorrow's volatility crush will provide sufficient compensation for this type risk. Don't get me wrong, being short curve can still be risky business. Just ask those traders with short curve positions in **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) following its numbing and much larger-than-expected price collapse last week. 

  

Even if you don't have the heart, required deep pockets for such positioning or decide this type of non-directional option trading isn't your thing; it's always good to know what others are thinking and doing. In the end and without it, there wouldn't be a market to "handle" all those other types of customer order flow. *What do you think?

One of the problems for option traders looking to capitalize on small-cap growth names can be the rather illiquid conditions. Listed call and put quotes in leading names such as **Iconix Brand Group** ([ICON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICON)), **FEI Co.** ([FEIC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FEIC)) and **Robbins & My**ers ([RBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RBN)) from Friday's spied IBD screen, "Small-Cap Leaders" are all a testament to products not very suitable for any type of option positioning. 

  

One name, which does make sense and perhaps "cents" based on its 2.5-month cup shaped technical development, is self-service coin counting and DVD kiosk operator **Coinstar** ([CSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSTR)). 

  

With shares averaging about 500,000 daily, traders wishing to explore option strategies ranging from outright purchases, buy-writes, verticals and calendars, can feel confident that there's enough liquidity provision to execute at a fair enough price and not worry about holding the proverbial bag when looking to exit as well. 

  

Currently, the front three months of July, August and October look approachable for these type strategies given quoted markets of $0.10 to $0.20 in its surrounding money options. And with an average call and put count of nearly 1,300 daily and decent levels of open interest to boot, there could be a better way to "handle" the market in some bulls' immediate futures. 

  

  

Shown above to illustrate one strategy available to modestly bullish investors is the August 52.50 / 55 bull call spread. We priced it at $1.70 versus a mid-market quote of $1.55 on three contracts. With shares near 57, the spread can expand to $2.50 over the next 42 calendar days by simply seeing CSTR remain above the sold 55- call strike. 

  

Did I say "simply?" While trading profitably is never a simple task, particularly when earnings are involved like they are here with Coinstar reporting Q2 results on July 28. This spread does make added sense and possible cents too for some already pricey option premiums.

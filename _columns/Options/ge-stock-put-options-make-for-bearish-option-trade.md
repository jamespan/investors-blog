With the [market uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-sells-off-these-signals-spark-doubts-about-market-direction/), it may be time to start looking for some bearish option trade candidates.




**General Electric** ([GE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GE)) stock is one that I'm looking after the recent rally failed at $8 and the stock is now back below the 200-day moving average.


GE stock has a paltry [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 17, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 15 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 33.


For such a bearish-looking stock, it could be worth trading straight put options.


Put options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain underlying asset at a certain price on or before expiry. It's a cheaper way to gain bearish exposure compared with selling short, and losses are limited to the premium paid.


With GE stock trading around 7.38 Monday, the Jan. 15-expiring put options with a strike price of 8 were trading for $1.12.


Put Option For GE Stock Costs $112
----------------------------------


Traders buying this option would pay $112 per contract and that is the most they could lose. This would occur if GE stock closed above 8 on the expiration date.



To calculate the break-even price on the position we take the strike price of 8 less the premium paid of $1.12, which gives a break-even price of 6.88. Below that it is all profit.


Traders who want to offset the cost slightly could turn the trade into a bear put spread by selling the 6-strike price put for around 24 cents.


It's shaping up to be a very interesting few weeks, with some key earnings announcements later this week and the election next week. Personally, I'll be closing out a lot of positions and taking a wait-and-see approach.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Over the last few weeks we've looked at some earnings bull put spreads like [this one](https://www.investors.com/research/options/amzn-stock-bull-put-spread-has-wide-profit-range/), [this one](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tsla-stock-bull-put-spread-earnings-trade/) and [this one](https://www.investors.com/research/options/amzn-stock-bull-put-spread-looks-capture-volatility-premium/). This week, another popular stock is due to report earnings and that is **Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) stock.


DIS stock is currently above the 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages and showing nice accumulation. The downside with DIS stock is the rather low [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 36 and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 14.


DIS earnings are set for Thursday after the close with the consensus for a loss of $0.47 per share on revenue of $15.64 billion.


The options market is pricing in a 5.60% move in the stock in either direction. Implied volatility is elevated at 38.2%, which puts it in the 68th percentile of all readings in the last 12 months. High volatility results in high option premiums which can be good for bull put spread traders.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish DIS Stock Option Trade**
----------------------------------


Traders who think DIS stock will rally or at least not drop by too much could look to sell a Feb. 12 180 put and buy a Feb. 12 175 put.


As of Friday, this spread was trading for around $1.95 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $195 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $305. That represents a potential 63.93% return on risk in five days as long as DIS stock remains above 180.


If DIS stock closes below 175 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $305.



With this being such a short-term trade, there is no chance to adjust the trade if it goes bad. Trading options over earnings can be quite risky. For that reason, keeping position size small is a good idea.


I view these as fun trades that either work or they don't and you have to be prepared to take the full loss if the stock drops.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

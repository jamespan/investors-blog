Amazon stock is currently just below a buy point, and option traders may want to be ready with some bullish option trades if the stock does break out.




**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is very highly rated, as you would expect with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 and a Relative Strength Rating of 92.


Investors would want to wait and see the market's reaction to the weekend warehouse fire east of Los Angeles, but if the stock does break out then a bull call spread could be a good way to play it. Amazon options are expensive, so using a spread is much cheaper than simply buying long calls.


Going out to August expiration, a 2,520 strike-price call option was trading on Friday around $119.70 and a 2,530 call was around $115.10.


Buying the 2,520 call and selling the 2,530 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $460 and the maximum profit potential would be $540 (difference in strike prices less the premium paid).


Of course, the prices may change slightly depending on where Amazon trades early this week.


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy, so if Amazon stock closes below 2,520 on Aug. 21, the most the trade could lose is the $460 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 2,530, so no matter how high Amazon stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $540.


A Way To Make Expensive Options Cheaper
---------------------------------------


Simply buying the 2,520 call would see significantly higher profits if Amazon stock rallies, but the price of the call would be prohibitively expensive for most trades. Just one 2,520 call option would cost $11,970 and the investor would lose that entire amount if Amazon closes below 2,520 on Aug. 21.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to Amazon stock using options.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.Â However, a bull call spread when done correctly can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock or ETF.

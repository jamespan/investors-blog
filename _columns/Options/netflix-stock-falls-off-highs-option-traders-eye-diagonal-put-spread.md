Netflix stock has had a tough few weeks with the stock dropping from 560 to 485.




When a quality company like **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) has a drop like this, I like to use a strategy called a diagonal put spread.


This option strategy is an advanced strategy because it utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.


Netflix Stock Option Trade
--------------------------


Let's look at an example for Netflix stock:


The trade I'm looking at is selling a June 4 put with a strike price of 450 and buying a June 18 put with a strike price of 440. As of yesterday's close, the June 4 put could be sold for around $3.50 and the June 18 put could be bought for $4.10. The net cost on the trade would be $60 and that is the most the trade could lose on the upside.



The risk on the trade is on the downside with a potential maximum loss of $1,060. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread (10) multiplied by 100 and adding in the cost of the trade (60).


The maximum potential gain is around $700 which would occur if Netflix stock closes right at 450 on June 4.


Profit Zone
-----------


The trade has a nice profit zone in between 438 and 488.


Aiming for a return of around 10%-15% makes sense and I would set a similar stop loss.


The worst-case scenario is a sharp drop in Netflix stock early in the trade. For this reason, if the stock drops below 450 I would also consider closing the trade early to minimize losses.


The initial trade set up has a delta of 1 meaning the position is roughly equivalent to owning 1 share of NFLX stock. Note that this delta number can change significantly as the stock starts to move.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

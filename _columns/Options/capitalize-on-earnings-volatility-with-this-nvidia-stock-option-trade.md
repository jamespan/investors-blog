**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is showing extremely high implied volatility in the lead up to the earnings announcement on Wednesday after the close.




There is also significant volatility skew, with short-term options showing much higher implied volatility than long-term options.


One way to take advantage of this skew is via a diagonal put spread.


This option strategy is an advanced strategy because it utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.


Let's look at an example with Nvidia stock:


Traders could sell an Aug. 25 put with a strike price of 420 and buy an Oct. 20 put with a strike price of 380.


Nvidia Stock Trade Risk Levels
------------------------------


As of Monday's close, the August put could be sold for around $6.20. The October put could be bought for $9.75.



The net cost of the trade would be $355, and that is the most the trade could lose on the upside.


The risk on the trade is on the downside, with a potential maximum loss of $4,355. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread (40) multiplied by 100 and adding in the cost of the trade (355).


The maximum potential gain is around $1,500. That would occur if Nvidia stock closes right at 420 on Aug. 25.


The trade has a nice profit zone in between 420 and 510.


Danger If Stock Falls Below 420
-------------------------------


If Nvidia stock stay between these values, the trade should do well. The main risk is if the stock drops below 420.


The initial trade set up has a delta of 2, meaning the position is roughly equivalent to owning 2 shares of Nvidia. Note that this delta number can change significantly as the stock starts to move.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Nvidia stock is ranked No. 3 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 69 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99.

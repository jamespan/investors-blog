With the S&P 500 finishing off 1.14% Monday, is the broader market's nascent correction just getting started or is a three percent, four-day pullback enough to rally the bulls into action looking forward? Only time will tell of course, but the option market may be providing investors an early heads up that the end is near and not in a bad sort of way. 

  

While we've come a long way the past six months off the October corrective lows, 32% in the S&P 500, key support provided from the May 2011 highs and 50-day simple moving average are still holding despite the one, two punch of disappointing nonfarm payrolls on Friday and hotter-than-expected CPI data out of China. Some will point to investors sensing "QE3" or additional monetary stimulus by the Fed is back on the table again and responsible for market prices not tumbling further. 

  

That may very well be true, but so is the fact the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" made a nice move on Monday towards deflating a bull more than a bit full of itself the past couple weeks. Witnessed today and for the first time in over a month, the market's notorious sentiment gauge finally turned fearful of something other than the fear of missing out; namely fear which goes hand-in-hand with investors convinced of lower market prices. 

  

At intraday highs Monday the VIX jumped about 18% above its 10-day simple moving average before closing narrowly lower at 18.44% and roughly 15.5% above the key short-term technical line. Why is this line and relationship important? As a mean-reverting instrument, the VIX will never collapse to zero or go so high as to think even the sky isn't the limit. 

  

Admittedly, at times the concept of mean reversion doesn't mean that much. Boundaries maybe previously thought unthinkable have been tested with the VIX hitting nearly 90% in 2008 and a full 50% higher than the 60% level struck during the dot.com bubble. 

  

Most often though and even when the VIX is doing the occasional or a prolonged bout of the unthinkable, short-term panics above the 10-day simple moving average are very prone to being recalibrated back towards more neutralized levels; even in a mad money market. That said, while Monday's 19% in the VIX is a far cry from some panics; it's also less than you or I might think.

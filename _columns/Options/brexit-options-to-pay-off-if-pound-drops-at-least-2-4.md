  Brexit Options To Pay Off If Pound Drops At Least 2.4%

For all the investor frenzy over a possible Brexit, pound bears need a decline of about 2.4% to make money through options should Britain choose to exit the European Union.


A trader will cover the cost of an option premium if sterling falls to $1.4193 over the next month, from $1.4545 recently, according to broker quotes compiled by Bloomberg.


That pricing suggests that either traders are more sanguine about the risks of Brexit, or they see less of an effect on the currency than some banks and money managers who have predicted that the pound will lose as much as 20% of its value if the U.K. quits. A smaller move, or a gain, will see a trader lose all the upfront premium they paid for the put option.


The run-up to Britain’s unprecedented vote on June 23 has driven brokers to price-in the highest one-month implied volatility since 2009. They’re seeing the pound liable to swing higher or lower by an annual 22%. That’s boosted the cost of options, particularly the one-month contracts expiring after the referendum’s results are published. Even so, downside protection is still not prohibitive, according to some investment advisors.


“Considering this is the biggest volatility since Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, the hedge is still cheap to make if you really think Brexit can happen,” said Bruno Atlan, a former currency trader who’s now chief executive officer of New Momentum Consultant in Madrid, an advisor to corporations on investments. “I don’t think Brexit will happen, but hedge funds, corporates and other players are speculating on it.”


The U.K. currency has had a tumultuous start to the week as opinion polls gave conflicting messages about the likelihood of an EU exit. It fell by as much as 1.1% on Monday, and gained as much as 1.5% the following day. On Wednesday, it was little changed at $1.4545.


For money managers, options are an integral part of managing risk, with a daily average turnover of $104 billion in the U.K. alone, according to Bank of England data. The current level of volatility is raising the cost of seeking such protection. The pound’s implied volatility compares with a 10-year average of 9.3%, and a current level of 9.6% for the euro.


As Brexit risks become more imminent, traders and market operators around the world are preparing for the decision. Margin requirements are getting raised, bank traders will be working overnight in London, and investors from Thailand to Boston are waking up to how their positions may be affected if Britons choose to leave the trading bloc they’ve been in since 1973.


Investors and analysts are forecasting turmoil if a Brexit occurs. Adrian Lee, the founder of Adrian Lee & Partners, which oversees $9 billion of foreign-exchange investments for money managers, predicts that sterling would fall 20% on a vote to leave the EU over the course of two to three days, with much of it on Day One.


A Bloomberg survey of economists in February showed 29 out of 34 economists saw it sinking to $1.35 or below within a week of a vote to leave -- levels last seen in 1985.

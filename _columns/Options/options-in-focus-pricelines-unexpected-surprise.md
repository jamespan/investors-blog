Online travel giant **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) narrowly missed sales estimates and reduced its profit outlook below Street views last night and shareholders paid the price. But the much larger forecasting error and one allowing some traders to enjoy the cheap seats on Wednesday's nasty technical ride south, was in Priceline's options with premiums reflecting a much smaller expected move.

  

Immediately in front of Priceline's earnings report, implieds of about 100% in the at-the-money AugWk2 contracts inferred a 68% or one standard deviation chance shares of PCLN would remain within roughly 9% of last night's close near 680 or 619 on the downside and 741 into Friday's expiration for the earnings pure play. Those estimates proved conservative to say the least as PCLN shares gapped down about 15% on the open and then proceeded to trend lower to finish off 17.31%.

  

At nearly double the expected move or almost two standard deviations, we know statistically the pricing was well off the mark as the likelihood of shares moving outside that range is less than 5%. Further, as this was a known earnings event, the premiums used in the calculation were richly-bid due to the uncertainty and higher-than-normal gap risk in shares, making the move all the more dazzling in our opinion. 

  

  

How else would a trader recognize pricing estimates as inefficient with regards to PCLN's share movement today? Another way to tell might be to illustrate a comparison of a long AugWk2 680 straddle from last night's close and one hedged delta neutral after building up short deltas due to the underlying movement in shares. With the fore-mentioned gap of about 15%, continuous hedging much to the delight of a trader holding the long curve or long gamma position proved very theoretical. 

  

Instead and as shown above, the trader would have been treated to a real world, financial windfall by simple buying in his or her short 100 deltas (per spread) at the opening price of 575.10. That's a very pleasant and largely unexpected surprise as the trader avoids the potential averaging of long delta purchases were shares of PCLN to have trended lower or worse yet, failed to move at all rather than today's beneficial outsized gap. The net impact is the position goes from effectively being a risky deep in-the-money put, albeit one that's currently showing more open profits, to an out-of-the-money, but certainly not-out-of-luck, synthetic long call on top of the existing call contract.

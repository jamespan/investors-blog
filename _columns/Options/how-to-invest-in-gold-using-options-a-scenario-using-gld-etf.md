Gold can have a valuable place in every investor's portfolio, especially in times of economic uncertainty.




As an asset class, gold can also provide a hedge against inflation, which seems to be rearing its head.


Today, I want to share a strategy where you can use options to gain exposure to gold without having to physically gold bars. We'll use the SPDR Gold Shares ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) for our example.


The strategy is called a synthetic long stock and it involves selling an at-the-money put and buying an at-the-money call.


GLD Synthetic Long Stock Trade
------------------------------


With the ETF trading at 172.69, traders could sell a January 2022-expiring put with a strike of 175 for around $10.25 and buy a January 175 call for $7.80.


Therefore, this January 2022 synthetic long stock trade would generate a credit of $2.45 per contract, or $245 in total.


A synthetic long position has a similar exposure to owning 100 shares of the underling ETF. That exposure would cost about $17,269 if the investor bought 100 shares of the GLD ETF.


Despite the fact this trade can be placed for a credit, the exposure is still large given the inherent *leverage* in the options.


Even though the option trade generates $245 in premium, the investor could still lose $17,255 if the GLD ETF went to $0.


Exposure To GLD ETF With A Fraction Of Cost
-------------------------------------------


The advantage of the trade is that an equivalent exposure to owning 100 shares can be gained for only a fraction of the cost.



For this synthetic long position, the margin requirement would be around $2,800, so the investor could use the leverage power of options to trade multiple synthetic long positions with the same amount of capital required to purchase 100 shares.


Of course, leverage is a double-edged sword, and if the ETF drops, losses will be magnified.


This strategy can be used on any stock or ETF, not just a gold ETF. Just be careful to watch your exposure and not take on too much leverage.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Options can be used to generate income, like in Wednesday's **Starbucks** ([SBUX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SBUX)) [covered call example](https://www.investors.com/research/options/starbucks-stock-is-falling-sharply-why-a-covered-call-makes-sense-now/). But they can also be used to protect a stock holding from a large drop in price. 




Believe it or now, options were originally created as hedging instruments. They are frequently used for portfolio protection.


Put options and bearish trades such as bear put spreads will do well when stocks drop.


Assume we own a portfolio of stocks that we want to hold for the long term but are concerned about the short-term outlook.


Instead of liquidating our portfolio, we could buy put options or put spreads on the **SPDR S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) ETF to help cushion the effects of any downturn.


Let's look at an example using SPY stock.


With the ETF trading around 391, a Nov. 18 expiration bear put spread could be set up through buying the 360 strike put and selling the 355 strike put. 


That spread was trading Wednesday for around $1.30, or $130 per contract, which is also the maximum potential loss.


SPY Stock Trade Maximum Profit
------------------------------


The maximum profit can be calculated by taking the width of the spread (5), subtracting the premium paid (1.30), and multiplying by 100.


This gives us 5-1.30 x 100 = $370.



The break-even price for the put spread would be 358.70. It can be calculated by taking the strike price of the long put (360) and subtracting the premium paid (1.30).


Buying protection like this can be expensive. But it can also help us sleep a little better at night if we are concerned about a large drop in stocks over the next two months.


Some traders will spend around 1%-2% of their portfolio value on put protection.


Put options can help protect against large price declines and are an important risk management tool for investors. Buying just the long put would be more expensive but would give greater protection in the event of a market crash.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

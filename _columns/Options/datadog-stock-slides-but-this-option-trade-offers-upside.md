**Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)) was Friday's [Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/datadog-stock-offers-multiple-buy-points/) pick and was part of an IBD list of stocks [near buy points for the new year](https://www.investors.com/news/datadog-applied-materials-stocks-near-buy-points-for-new-year/). 




Datadog stock has traded sideways in the last two months, but in that time has shown impressive accumulation. But on Monday, the stock sold off and slid below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/), though it continues to form a base.


The company is ranked No. 3 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 90, and EPS Rating of 66 and a Relative [Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97. 


One mildly bullish option strategy to consider is a bull put spread. This can be a good strategy to implement when a trader has a slightly bullish outlook and implied volatility is higher than normal. 


Datadog Stock Bull Put Spread
-----------------------------


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. 


Selling the January-expiration, 160-strike put and buying the 155 put would create a bull put spread. 



This spread was trading on Friday, before Monday's tumble, for around $1.70. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $170 in option premium. The maximum risk would be $330. 


That represents a 51% return on risk between now and Jan. 21 if Datadog stock remains above 160. If Datadog closes below 155 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $330. 


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 158.30, which is calculated as 175 less the $2 option premium per contract. 


Datadog Trade Risk Similar To Owning 18 Shares
----------------------------------------------


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 9. That means it is a similar exposure to owning nine shares of DDOG stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves. 


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1.70 to $3.40, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


With Datadog's earnings due in early February, this trade would have no earnings risk. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

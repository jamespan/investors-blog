Shares of UK-based wireless provider **Vodafone** ([VOD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VOD)) doubled their year-to-date gains Tuesday to a tad more than 10% following a bullish Barron's article. The weekly business publication recommended shares of VOD as a cheaper valuation play on Verizon's upcoming iPhone deal. Vodafone maintains a 45% stake in Verizon Wireless but traded at a P/E of 9 (now 9.88) compared to **Verizon**'s ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) P/E of 16. 

  

With sometimes choppy, gap filled activity a reality for VOD's price chart due to its ADR status, traders looking to position in sympathy with Barron's call might take a look at its listed option market. Despite the jerkiness of the underlying shares, Vodafone's options are quite reasonable in terms of liquidity and add a layer of security not altogether possible with simply trading the stock. 

  

Surrounding money strikes out through April are quoted five to 10 cents between the bid and ask for Vodafone's individual call and put markets. At the same time, decent existing open interest and a fair amount of diverse activity in Tuesday's session suggests traders can feel confident about looking at both outrights and a variety of spreads without incurring too much in the way of slippage.

  

  

To illustrate, for a bull wishing to participate in VOD's technical based breakout, one reasonably priced idea considering mixed premiums, liquidity and an upcoming earnings release due sometime in late January is the February 29 / 30 call spread. Priced for $0.33 per spread, a portfolio sized at $20K using 2% as a per position risk parameter could initiate 13 spreads. 

  

The spread cuts down the price of the 29 call by 50% and requires a move of just more than 2% by expiration in order to breakeven and should VOD rally above $30, would yield a return of 200% in just more than a month's time. For bulls willing to jump in, just remember to always "Mind the Gap" when going overseas to shop for items like cup with handles. *What do you think?

Steel stocks started taking a little break this week, but may still have another move in them. Nucor stock is one of the leaders in the group and a bull put spread could be a way to play it.




Bull Put Spread On Nucor Stock
------------------------------


**Nucor** ([NUE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUE)) is testing its 50-day moving average and has a number of high ratings according to IBD. The company is ranked No. 2 in the steel producers industry group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 96 and an [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Here's how traders could setup a bull put spread option trade in Nucor stock.



With a bull put spread, a trader sells an out-of-the-money put and then buys a further out-of-the-money put. For NUE stock, selling the 100 put and buying the 95 put creates a bull put spread. Both puts use the same expiration. In this case, we'll use Dec. 17.


This spread traded around $1.10 yesterday meaning you receive $110 in option premium with a maximum risk of $390. The maximum risk is the difference of the strike prices less the premium received.


Managing The Trade
------------------


Dividing the maximum profit by the maximum loss gives you a 28% return on risk between now and Dec. 17, if NUE stock remains above 100. It can go up or sideways and either way you profit.


If Nucor stock closes below 95 on the expiration date, basically losing support at its September low, the trade loses the full $390.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 98.90. You calculate that using the short strike of 100 less the 1.10 option premium per contract.


In terms of exposure, this bull put spread trade has a delta of nine. Put another way, the exposure is similar to owning nine shares of NUE stock. But keep in mind, this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1.10 to $2.50, I would consider closing early for a loss.


With Q3 earnings already released, this trade on Nucor stock should have no earnings risk.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

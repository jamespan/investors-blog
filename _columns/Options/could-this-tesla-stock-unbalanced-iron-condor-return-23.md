**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is currently showing its lowest relative strength index reading in nearly three years as the stock has slumped from around 310 to 217 in recent weeks.




There is a lot of potential chart support around the 210 level.


Implied volatility is at 72%, which is toward the higher end of the 12-month range of 36% to 84%. The IV rank is 77% and the IV percentile is 87%.


When volatility is high, an iron condor can be placed further out-of-the-money, giving the trade a higher chance at success.


Today, we're going to look at an iron condor example on Tesla stock, but with a slight difference. Instead of a standard neutral trade, we will structure the condor with a slight bullish bias. This can be achieved by using a wider put spread than the call spread.


Combination Of Two Spreads
--------------------------


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Nov. 18 expiry, we could sell the 170 put and buy the 160 put. That spread could be sold Wednesday for around $1.30.



Then we set up the bear call spread, which could be placed by selling the 270 call and buying the 275 call. This spread could be sold Wednesday for around $0.55.


Notice that the put spread is 10 points wide and the call spread is only five points wide. This gives the trade a slight bullish bias, but also more risk on the downside.


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1.85, or $185 of premium.


The profit zone ranges between 168.15 and 271.85. This can be calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


Trade Could Return More Than 22%
--------------------------------


The maximum risk is $815 on the put side and $315 on the call side.


If we take the premium ($185) divided by the maximum risk ($815), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 22.7%.


A stop loss in this case might be calculated based on 25% of capital at risk, so a loss of around $165.


Tesla stock is ranked No. 2 in its automakers industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 54, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 77 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 32.


Tesla is due to report earnings on Oct. 19, so this trade would have exposure to earnings.

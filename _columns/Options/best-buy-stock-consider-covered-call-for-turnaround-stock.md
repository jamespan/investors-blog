Best Buy stock was recently listed as one of the best dividend stocks for 2020.




**Best Buy** ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) also just bounced nicely off the 50-day moving average and it boasts high ratings from [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-bed-bath-and-beyond-inc-bbby.aspx).


With a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 93 and an RS Rating of 91, Best Buy stock could be a nice addition to a long-term dividend investor's portfolio.


Using options, investors can further enhance the yield on stocks like Best Buy when writing covered calls.


When selling a covered call, the investor receives a premium and has an obligation to sell the shares at the strike price if called upon to do so.


One call option contract represents 100 shares, so investors can sell multiple call options if they have a particularly large stock holding.


Over time, covered calls have the potential to increase returns while also decreasing the volatility of a portfolio.


Best Buy Stock: Option Trade
----------------------------


For Best Buy stock, a November 120 call option can currently be sold for around $2.80, which would generate $280 in premium per contract and increase the annualized yield by 18.14%.


The $2.80 in premium received also gives a small buffer on the downside of 2.53%. That means Best Buy stock could trade 2.53% lower between now and Nov. 20 and the covered call trade would still break even.


The total capital at risk in the trade would be $10,770. If Best Buy stock went to zero, that's how much the trade would lose.



However, if Best Buy stock crossed back below the 50-day moving average it may be worth closing the entire position early to avoid larger losses.


Covered calls are a fantastic way to generate extra income from a stock holding while also providing some downside protection.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

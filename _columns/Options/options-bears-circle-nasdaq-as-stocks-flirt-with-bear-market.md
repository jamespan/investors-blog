Options traders are betting that the pain is far from over in the Nasdaq 100 Index.


Unconvinced that a two-day decline of 5% found the bottom, they’re loading up on protection in the technology-heavy index, pushing the cost of options on a Nasdaq 100 exchange-traded fund to the highest in almost two years vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Futures on the index fell 0.4% at 8:34 a.m. in London.


It's the latest exodus from risk in the U.S. equity market, with selling that started in energy shares spreading to everything from health care to banks. Technology companies, which until recently had been spared because of their low debt burden and rising earnings, joined the rout as investors focus on elevated valuations among the industry’s biggest stocks.


"Exuberance has turned to panic pretty quickly," said Stephen Solaka, managing partner of Belmont Capital Group in Los Angeles, which oversees about $400 million. "Technology stocks have had quite a run, and now they’re seeing momentum the other way."


Options are signaling more trouble ahead, just as professional speculators dump bullish wagers on the group. Hedge funds and large speculators have pared back their long positions on the Nasdaq 100 for a fourth week out of five, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. Investors were dealt a blow on Friday when disappointing results from **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) and **Tableau Software** ([DATA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DATA)) sent both companies down more than 40%.


The sell-off has been heaviest in a handful of momentum stocks that boosted returns in the Nasdaq 100 last year, sending the gauge's valuation to a one-year high versus the S&P 500’s in December. Since then, the Nasdaq multiple has tumbled faster than the S&P 500’s, dropping 20% vs. 13%, as stocks from **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) to **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) faced scrutiny from investors amid broader economic concerns.


Even after a 16% plunge from a record in November, Nasdaq 100 companies still trade at 16.3 times projected profits, higher than the S&P 500’s 15.4 ratio. Scott Minerd, chief investment officer for Guggenheim Partners, said in an interview that technology stocks will tumble even further this year as investors flee to safety and buyers stay on the sidelines.


Daily swings are getting increasingly jarring. Less than six weeks into the year, the Nasdaq Composite Index has moved 2% or more nine times, compared with 15 for all of 2015. Only in 2009, 2000 and 2011 have there been so many big swings at this point, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1971.


The biggest speculators reduced bullish positions on Nasdaq 100 futures to 21,720 contracts in the week ended Feb. 2, the lowest level in four months, according to data from the CFTC. That compares with November, when they were net long by 81,564 contracts.


The one-month implied volatility spread between the **Powershares QQQ** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) and the **SPDR S&P 500** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) widened to 6.1 points on Monday, the highest since April 2014, Bloomberg data show. The spread is almost more than double the five-year average of two points.


"Tech names had become a crowded long, and now we are seeing the unwind," said Pravit Chintawongvanich, a New York-based derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors. "Investors are willing to pay up for protection in tech and growth names. It is probably justified. You could see this volatility spread widen even further."

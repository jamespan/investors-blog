**Humana** ([HUM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HUM)) stock was yesterday's [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/humana-stock-nears-buy-point/) after clearing an early buy point. But with the market uptrend on fragile ground, investors may not want to risk significant amounts of capital on a purchase of Humana stock. Here's how to participate on the upside with limited risk.




Humana Stock Shows Relative Strength
------------------------------------


HUM stock is currently trading above both its [50-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) as well as the longer-term 200-day line. That puts it in the minority of most stocks today. It's relative strength line reflects how its doing versus the S&P 500. For most of this year, Humana stock has outperformed. Plus the managed care group is a strong No. 33 out of the 197 IBD Industry Groups.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Humana stock is ranked No. 1 in its group, and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 87 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92.



Though with the general market still struggling, investors may wish to tread lightly.


One way to gain exposure to Humana stock without risking too much is via a bull call spread. It's cheaper than buying the stock outright and can protect precious capital in these volatile times.


Setting Up A Bull Call Spread
-----------------------------


Let's assume a trader has a price target of 500 on Humana stock between now and mid-November.


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call offsets the cost of the trade with less money out of your pocket. But it comes with its own cost by limiting the upside potential.


Going out to November expiration, a 480-strike call option on Humana stock traded around 27.50 yesterday. The 500-strike call was around 20.


Buying the 480 call and selling the 500 call creates a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $750 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). That's also the most you could lose on the trade.


Managing the Trade
------------------


The maximum potential profit would be $1,250 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy. No matter how far HUM stock closes below 480 on Nov. 18, the most the trade loses is the $750 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 500, so no matter how high HUM stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $1,250. Still, that's well over a double if Humana stock goes over your price target in that time.


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 430, I would consider closing early for a loss.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

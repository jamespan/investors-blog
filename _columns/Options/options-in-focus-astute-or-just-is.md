Earlier today we spied a trader asking whether a broken wing butterfly had been put up in the **SPDRs Gold Trust ETF** ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) for $0.63 in the 160, 167 and 180 strikes and was it possible to buy it? A public reply back stated it was and the trade was put up for the questioned price. No other details were given, but in checking the GLD option board it was quickly figured out the March calls was where the transaction occurred. What was also apparent, to us at least, was that a couple more important items were left out of the quick Q&A dialogue. 

  

First of all, considering the GLD trades around 250,000 contracts daily, this modified butterfly wasn't exactly lighting up the screens with hints of insider trading. While we're not entirely sure if that was a concern or otherwise, volume in the assumed purchased 180 call amounted to less than 200 contracts on the session. Thus we're looking at less than 1/10th of 1% of today's volume in that strike and ultimately, a very small spread. Wait a second you say? Couldn't the butterfly have been in another contract month? Not in our estimation. 

  

It's true we did only a fast sizing up of various markets, but we're more than a bit confident the action wasn't in January, any near-term Weeklys or the February contract. How do we know with admittedly some sloppy sleuthing on our part? It comes down to the fact that not only are those same strike fly's quoted for a much larger debit, but with GLD's very liquid option markets and Wednesday's rather tight daily range to boot, the spread simply couldn't have traded anywhere other than in March for a debit of $0.63 and paid by the holder of the long broken butterfly. 

  

To go a step further as to why the spread is also a situation of "it is, what it is", this position also remains very much available for pretty much the same price and possibly even a couple pennies cheaper for any takers. Well, isn't that a good thing? Again, it's really just pricing that reflects what the market will bear currently with the spread's long call being at-the-money. Remember this, ultimately a long broken butterfly maintains lopsided risk above one of its purchased wings and as the other analyst noted, will mean required extra margin based on the risk of the larger sold spread. 

  

In this instance, if shares of GLD were to sprint higher, the trader is at risk of losing $6.63 [Debit + Bear Spread Width â€” Bull Spread Width] per spread at expiration if GLD were above the wider sold, component 167 / 180 bear vertical. Of course, if on that third Friday of March shares were trading at 167, the trader would profit by the max profit of the seven-point bull call spread minus the debit paid or $6.37 per spread. That all said, the April broken butterfly using the same strikes is trading for roughly even money. Now ain't that special? Not really.

Let's first say that I'm not a fan of **SodaStream** ([SODA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SODA)) as I see its product as being a bit too gimmicky as to have staying power that's able to deliver on growth. Maybe consumers still need their iPhone 5 in the midst of an economic downturn, but I don't think they're going to continue splurging on the SodaStream brand. 

  

In saying that and I could very well be wrong (it wouldn't be the first time), if I were bullish on tomorrow morning's pre-market earnings release and thought a pop in shares was likely, I certainly wouldn't position with deep in-the-money calls as a "conservative way to play it", which was one the Mad Money's recommendations this past Friday night. 

  

Shares are currently about a buck lower from where Jim Cramer talked about the "phenomenon" that is SodaStream, a company he thinks will benefit from the Christmas season and "isn't yet played out." Truthfully, SODA's performance into its earnings has been rather impressive given the broader market's own volatile price shellacking this week. 

  

The real problem I have with Jim's option idea is the obvious lack of attention to SODA's markets. In particular, due to sky-high short interest, the deep calls are, across the board, incredibly illiquid with individual quoted markets some 10% to 15% wide. 

  

I will say I respect having a concrete stop loss in the form of the premium paid, at least conceptually. The problem is for the likes of let's say the September 55 call with shares at $69 and the near 80 delta contract has a market of $17.60 Bid | $19.60 Ask. Not only is the two-buck spread distance a bit more than 10% and representative of a large potential headache, there's still a fair chunk of time premium as well, which would need to be expunged by a rather nice-sized rally in order to profit. 

  

I'm not saying SODA won't rally and probably because I'm not a fan, it will shoot higher. However, this type position certainly has two strikes against it going into the report. And remember or know this, the deeper in the money one looks, the trader is only transferring additional and fairly large risk to the downside in order to make up for upside performance, should shares rally. Net net, SODA's inherent flaws with its deep calls fail terribly as a "conservative way to play it."

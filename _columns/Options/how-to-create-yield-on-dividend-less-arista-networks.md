Growth stocks generally do not provide much in the way of dividends, and that is certainly the case for **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)).




ANET stock currently does not pay a dividend, but savvy investors can still create a yield from it using covered calls.


A covered call involves buying 100 shares of the underlying stock and simultaneously selling a call option against those shares.


Selling the calls limits the upside but increases the yield from the investment in the form of option premium.


The investor keeps the premium generated from selling calls no matter what happens with the stock.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-arista-networks-anet.aspx), ANET stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 98 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96.


When trading covered calls, most investors sell monthly calls against their stock to make the most of the effects of time decay. That makes a lot of sense but also requires a lot of active management.


Yearly Covered Calls?
---------------------


What if we sold yearly covered calls against ANET stock? Let's take a look.



On ANET stock, a Jan. 17, 2025 call option with a strike price of 300 can currently be sold for around $31.50, generating $3,150 in premium per contract.


Purchasing 100 shares of Arista Networks stock will cost around $26,500. But the net cost can be reduced by the $3,150 option premium received.


Therefore, we have created a yield (3,150/26,500) in 345 days, which is 11.9%, or 12.58% annualized.


That sure beats the dividend yield on most stocks in the current market and still allows for around $3,500 of capital appreciation on ANET stock.


Covered calls are a fantastic way to generate extra income from a stockholding while also providing some downside protection.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

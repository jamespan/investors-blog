With less than 90 minutes to go in Wednesday’s session, high-flying **Netflix**  ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) shares are testing key 50-day simple moving average support inside a prior bullish price gap, which could mark a corrective low of about 20% within the stock’s longstanding weekly up-channel. 

  

The price action, which also marks a second day of relatively tight doji candlestick consolidating appears to have caught the interest of fast money option traders. Efforts today have been highly concentrated in the Weekly March contract, set to expire two days from now.

  

Captivating bullish patrons, the slightly out-of-the money Weekly March 210 call has seen nearly 6,500 contracts change hands compared to open interest of 2,700. Priced for $0.87 mid market and shares at 204, if purchased naked (by themselves), a trader will need a maximum move higher of about 3.80% in order to realize a double in value and slightly less if shares rallied sooner within its very narrow time window.

  

One idea this strategist likes as a very short-term position, is to sell those same calls as part of a regular 205 / 210 / 215 long butterfly. Dollar wise, the strategy costs about $1.10 per spread compared to $0.87 for the single long call. However and thought relevant for both positions, given the minimal room for error, the use of lesser portfolio risk, such as 1% versus a more typical 2% - 3%, might be considered and would also equalize that monetary playing field. 

  

  

Lastly, standing ready to close half the position on a double tomorrow if shares were to rally and benefit the fly or the long call for that matter—is likely to make a good deal of sense of cents as part of one’s trading plan.

  

Shown above and to illustrate, readers are looking at a three lot long call versus two butterflies. The total difference in dollars at risk is $40, while net dollar outlays of $260 and $220 respectively, should keep a hypothetical $20K portfolio looking a bit smarter irrespective of the outcome.

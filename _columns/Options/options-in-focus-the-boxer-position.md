When it comes to new option strategies to trade, the bottom line is that there are none. There may be however, positions, which you may not have considered prior, which might be a derivative, pardon the pun, or variation on a more familiar position. One such strategy is something I'd like to coin is the "boxer" as it helps guarantee a current champion of profits and even allows for additional gains if our champ gets unseated and knocked down to the proverbial fight mat. 

  

Plain and simple, the boxer is three-quarters of the box play. The box play is a bull and bear vertical using the same contract month and strikes. Combined, the two always add up to being worth the difference of the strikes come expiration due to intrinsic value between the two. 

  

Because of the box's known worth/value through its life, the position doesn't garner much use for anyone other than the likes of market makers. Those traders can capitalize on profits measured in pennies and even fractional amounts due to generous commission schedules, interest rates, tax treatment and the likes and which others simply can't. 

  

That all said, directional traders using one of the two vertical types first and subsequently finding themselves in a profitable position, might consider establishing the second vertical as a way to lock in a profit via a legged box. If liquidity in the positioned calls or puts is poor due to the contracts (now) being deep in the money, buying the out-of-the money vertical may prove an easier avenue to navigate than trying to close out the profitable spread. 

  

A variation on this strategy is our boxer position which only purchases the required long call or long put. By not selling the further away contract to complete a vertical and a full box, the trader opens up the possibility for much larger profits. Forfeiting that sale of course needs to be done judiciously. 

  

Generally, the boxer only becomes an easy decision when the premium taken in from the would-be sale is small enough as to not make a substantial difference in the profit at hand. For instance, on a five-point box, if the difference between buying the outright contract or buying the second vertical is $0.10, $0.15 or even $0.20, we'd consider the boxer over the locked up box position as the stronger play.

  

While a bit of a longshot, if the stock swings hard enough in the other direction as to make the original vertical worthless, the trader will have those losses covered by the legged long contract. Further, the naked long contract can continue to mimic the underlying stock movement, one-for-one, and vastly increase one's overall profit potential until an adjustment, such as into a vertical, is made. 

  

On the other hand, if the trader is considering the boxer vs. the box and faced with an extra $0.40 or greater in pocket on a five point strike situation, he or she should be very judicious in considering its merit. Personally, I'd need to be strongly incentivized by a fresh or pending catalyst considered worthy of pushing shares in the other direction; before placing a wager on that type of boxer not yet championed.

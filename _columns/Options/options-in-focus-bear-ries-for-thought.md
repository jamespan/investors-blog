A few bulls were back and feeling chipper Thursday. With less than an hour to go, the S&P 500 is advancing nicely after falling for six straight sessions. But whether today's third rally attempt proves enduring remains to be seen. With most highly rated stocks falling below prior buy points and many others showing leading wear and tear, using strength as an opportunistic bear might be a positional move to consider, rather than counting the days for a healthier market climate to show up. 

  

While many growth oriented traders refrain from positioning during corrective or bear phases, those environments can be highly profitable. And options, which offer an abundance of risk-to-reward profiles, might be worth considering as a better way with which to trade. 

  

Option traders have the benefit of being able to design limited and open risk strategies by incorporating calls, puts and / or stock. A position can range from an ultra simple, such as a pure bearish directional bet using a long put on a strike and of a certain duration or maturity of one's choice. Others like me will gravitate towards a spread methodology such as the vertical.

  

This directional strategy can reduce the premium at risk compared to an outright purchase. The spread is also a great building block for legging into long butterflies or long condors. It also comes in handy if you're uncertain about premium levels; whether they appear expensive or even cheap but leave you with that "you never know" feeling of a value trap. 

  

In the end, there are many types of opportunities in the option market not available to stock traders. Of course too, there are various ways of losing money, which can't harm bulls or bears simply positioned in the underlying. Nonetheless, with a bit of educating oneself on those matters, the opportunity to trade with more confidence and added profitability is certainly possible. And when there are at least three or more days of biding one's time as a patient bull, learning something new sounds like a good way to spend at least a few of those waking hours.

Have you ever purchased a call and lost money even though the stock price rose? Have you ever sold a covered call and been frustrated because that call did not decline in price as expiration approached? If you have, you are not alone. How and why options prices change is a mystery to many first-time options traders. This is the first in a series of articles that discuss the seemingly complex topic of options price behavior. Actually, it is not complex at all.

  

**Option Price Behavior Introduced**

  

Table 1 contains theoretical values and deltas of a hypothetical 100 Call option at different stock prices and different days to expiration. The purpose of Table 1 is to illustrate some basic concepts of how option prices change as stock prices and time change. The rows in Table 1 represent the stock prices, and the columns represent the number of days to expiration.

  

In row 5, column 1, for example, the stock price is 100 and there are 90 days to expiration.  In this cell, the price of the 100 Call is 5.09, and the delta is .53 (or 53%). In practical terms, **delta is the estimated change in option price for a one dollar change in stock price, assuming other factors such as time to expiration and volatility remain constant.**

  

Now look at the cell that is up a row in row 6 in column 1 in which the stock price is 101 at 90 days to expiration. The stock price has increased by one dollar to 101, but the price of the 100 Call has increased by 53 cents to 5.62. This change in price is equal to the delta of .53 in row 5, column 1.

  

Looking down a row to the cell in row 4 in column 1, the stock price is 99 at 90 days to expiration. The stock price has decreased by one dollar to 99, but the price of the 100 Call has decreased by 53 cents to 4.56. This change in price, even though it is a decrease, is equal to the delta of .53 in row 5, column 1.

  

Looking up and down the rows and across the cells in Table 1, you can see that the concept of delta holds true, although the changes in option price are not always exactly equal to the delta. This is due to two factors, rounding and changes in delta. In column 4, from row 8 to row 9, for example, the price of the 100 Call rises by 66 cents from 5.34 to 6.00 while the delta is .65. Also, in column 2, from row 4 to row 3, the price of the 100 Call falls by 48 cents from 4.11 to 3.63 while the delta is .49.

  

**Deltas Change**

  

Looking up and down the columns and across the rows in Table, it is apparent that the delta of the 100 Call changes. What might be so apparent is the logic of the changes. Here are some simple guidelines.

  

First, **the delta of an at-the-money call is approximately +0.50**. In row 5 in Table 1, the stock price is 100, and the delta in column 1 is .53. This is *not exactly* .50, but it is approximately .50. Looking across row 5, you can see that the delta gradually decreases to .52 in column 4 and then to .51 in column 6. At expiration, with the stock at 100, the 100 Call expires worthless, so the delta is .00.

  

The second guideline is that **the delta of an in-the-money call is greater than +0.50**. In rows 6 through 10, the stock price increases from 101 to 105, and in these rows the 100 Call is in the money, because the stock price is above the strike price of the call. And, in every cell in these rows, the delta of the 100 Call is greater than .50. In fact, the more that the call is in the money, the higher the delta.

  

The third guideline is that **the delta of an out-of-the-money call is less than +0.50**. In rows 1 through 4, the stock price ranges from 96 to 99, and in these rows the 100 Call is out of the money, because the stock price is below the strike price of the call. In every cell in these rows, the delta of the 100 Call is less than .50. In fact, the more that the call is out of the money, the lower the delta.

  

Table 1 also illustrates how deltas change with time. Looking across rows 6 through 10, when the 100 call is in the money, the deltas increase to 1.00 as time passes and expiration approaches. Deltas of in-the-money calls increase as expiration approaches, because an in-the-money call is exercised and becomes a long stock position at expiration. And, by definition, the delta of long stock is +1.00.

  

In rows 1 through 4, when the 100 call is out of the money, the deltas decrease to .00 as expiration approaches. This happens, because out-of-the-money calls expire worthless at expiration. Since no stock position is created, the delta is zero.

  

**Deltas Help Traders Estimate Results**

  

Knowing the approximate delta of a position gives a trader a realistic expectation of how much an option will rise or fall with a changing stock price. If a trader has 5 calls, each of which has a delta of +.60, for example, then the total delta of the 5-call position is +3.00, which is approximately equal to long 300 shares of stock. Consequently if the stock price rises by one dollar in a short time, then the position of owning five calls can be expected to make approximately $300 before commissions. Similarly, if the stock price falls by one dollar, the loss of approximately $300 is a realistic estimate.

  

**Conclusion**

  

Option prices do not change dollar-for-dollar with changes in stock price. Option prices change by the *delta*. Traders who know the delta of their positions will be able to realistically estimate of how much they will make or lose as the stock price changes.

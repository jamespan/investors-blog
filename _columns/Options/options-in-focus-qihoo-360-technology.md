Chinese software outfit and recent IPO, Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), joined the IBD 50 this past weekend debuting at No. 48. A swift jettisoning of shares up into the upper reaches of a first stage weekly base and the company's recent doubling of sales during Q2 look to have laid the initial groundwork for stock trading growth bulls. 

  

For traders looking to position for the Holy Grail of the next, next big thing, but maybe smartly realizing most companies simply won't achieve that type of greatness and could even fare a good deal worse, the good news is Qihoo 360 Technology maintains listed calls and puts. The better news is decent trader involvement, bid/ask spreads of $0.05 to $0.15 and surrounding money strikes stationed one point apart are sufficient to approach limited risk strategies. 

  

Longer-term bulls wanting to hold a core position of stock might consider either a married put or collar strategy. Both spread positions purchase a protective put which allows the trader to carry the equivalent of a long synthetic call through expiration. 

  

  

The latter collar strategy goes a step further by financing the cost of the protective put by selling the identical amount of calls in the same contract month. Combined, the synthetic long call and short call add up to the risk and reward equivalent of a bull call spread or bull vertical. Shown above is a three-lot collar using a sale of the September 24 calls and purchase of the September 19 put for about even money with shares at 19.65. 

  

As both mentioned strategies are adjustable with the ability to lock in gains, increase one's profit potential or even accumulate shares on weakness without getting into the same hazardous business of doubling down simply because its lower and making the trader's initial foray look silly, those seem like options which make sense and maybe good cents as well.

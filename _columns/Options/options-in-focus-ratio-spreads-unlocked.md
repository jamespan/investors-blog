The price of an option, much like a stock, is subject to what the market will bear. Most traders will tell you, grudgingly of course, the market is also always right, until its not. When traders get into ratio option spreads however, the price may seem altogether wrong, if one is unfamiliar with how they're expressed as a packaged spread in the open market. 

  

In the following let's illustrate this point by looking at a couple calendar spreads. Our hope is traders will walk away with a stronger understanding of how more complex spreads might be quoted. First, let's start with a simple 1:1 long calendar in the notorious XYZ Corp. The strategist wants to establish a four-lot spread using the mid market of the quotes shown below:

  

June 10 call: $0.70 B // $0.80 A

  

July 10 call: $1.00 B // $1.10 A

  

Splitting both markets the trader is presented with a $0.30 spread value using $1.05 and $0.75 versus a quoted spread market of $0.20 B // $0.40 A. His or her bid when placed will reflect the $0.30 value. However, as the bid is on a per contract basis, the associated debit will be $120, not $30 as the trader is using a position size of four contracts.

  

Easy enough, right? Now, let's say the trader wishes to mix it up a bit and put together a ratio calendar where fewer short contracts are sold. The trader decides this might be a good way to collect some premium in the event the stock winds up sitting near the 10 strike, but maintain upside potential in case a quicker than expected upswing in XYZ occurs.

  

This being the case, the trader decides to purchase four of July 10 calls, but will now only sell three of the June's. Net, net the trader is long one call contract. This will benefit the trader if XYZ were to move up, but at the same time, the three short contracts will greatly reduce the net debit and benefit the position if shares remain near the strike.

  

With that said, let's say the trader is ready to execute this position. He or she puts in the contract amounts of +4 and -3 at their online brokerage and lo and behold the following market greets the trader: $1.60 B // $2.30 A. Whoa!! What's this?? What's occurred is the spread is priced to reflect the dollar cost of the 3x straight calendar plus the cost of one additional July contract.

  

Here's how it works. Again, using our prices of $1.05 and $0.75, the trader has three straight calendar spreads priced for $.30 per contract. That translates into a grand total of $0.90, as the cost would be a debit of $90. At that point, the trader adds the "extra" fourth contract priced (still) at $1.05 to the straight calendar price of $0.90. The combined sum gives the trader a price of $1.95 or $195 for the whole kit and caboodleâ€”which voila, is smack dab in the middle of the quoted mystery market of $1.60 B // $2.30 A.

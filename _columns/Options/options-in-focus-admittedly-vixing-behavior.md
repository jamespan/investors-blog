Bulls can blame whomever or whatever they see fit regarding Tuesday's bearish reversal in the likes of the **S&P 500 ETF**  ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)). Bottom line though, with Day 13 of the market's rally attempt going from a contained but good-looking bid below the 200-day simple moving average to a weak close, buying the latest pullback is harder to justify. 

  

Technically, today's reversal managed to fill about 50% of the November 30 upside gap in the SPY and challenge the 50-day simple moving average support. Now, don't get me wrong, that part sounds somewhat tempting as a technician known to appreciate pullbacks on occasion. However, not helping matters or maybe just baffling enough to leave this strategist to scratch his head is the CBOE Volatility Index.

  

Entering the session we wholeheartedly expected the market's out-the-gate, seasonally pleasing bid. The likes of the SPY had put together a nice-looking hammer reversal off range support Monday, which we personally were fond of. Additionally and of more importance, the VIX had all but RSVP'd bulls with its own lower close, third test of its 200-day simple moving average in the face of all those scary and "Moody's" credit market headlines. 

  

In the aftermath of Tuesday with the VIX going from a constructively fresh, intraday "Thump!" below the former gift-wrapped red price ribbon, only to reverse back above the long-term average in its own hammer patternâ€”we're admittedly "VIX'ed." However, with the FTD count extending itself beyond our own cutoff window of 13 and one back-tested by the folks at Quantifiable Edges, the market's seasonal bias is looking emphatically less ho-ho-hopeful and not letting optimistic sentiment for a further good tidings stand in the way in better decisions.

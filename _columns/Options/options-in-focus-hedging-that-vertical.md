Hedging a position can be of great value to an option trader given they know what they're doing and have given consideration to both the benefits and limitations of the trade adjustment. One type of hedge we'd warn against as a general rule is hedging a vertical spread with stock. 

  

The use of shorting or buying stock to hedge off existing delta risk which we'll assume has led to some paper profits probably sounds like a step in the right direction. The trader is being cautious and trying to take a little something off the table without being too greedy, right? 

  

That may be true, but the vertical position is also a contract neutral spread, as the number of long contracts held equals the number of shorts. Thus, buying or selling stock as a hedge dramatically alters the risk profile of the position as the trader goes from a limited risk situation to one with significantly larger potential losses in the event of an adverse move in the underlying. 

  

Stronger adjustments or hedges to consider would be to reduce the spread size which will guarantee smaller potential losses or possibly even a guaranteed profit, though reducing the maximum associated with the original position. Alternatively, adding a countering vertical to form either a butterfly or a long condor can be appealing spreads to consider. 

  

And of course, if you're not afraid of "boxing" yourself in, which you shouldn't be given the right prices, working the other contract type and from the other directional camp i.e. buying a put spread to hedge long call spread, can also make more sense and cents than otherwise.

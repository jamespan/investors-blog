Despite the broader market continuing to turn up the heat on bulls by breaking to fresh weekly lows and penetrating more key technical levels in the broader averages, one growth hotty still trying to grind and press bears near its all-time and extended-looking highs is **Green Mountain Coffee Roasters** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)). 

  

Since ramping up higher in March, shares of GMCR have gained roughly 250%. Trouble could be brewing though as price action on the weekly chart looks extended. Looking at that time frame, the stock has jumped above upward-channel resistance with nary a base to show for all of its continued upside since its original breakout. 

  

Late in Tuesday's session, GMCR has bowed slightly to the market's own red tide by giving up about -0.70%. Today's well-roasted relative strength performance has been tied to buzz the company could be added to the S&P 500. 

  

On the option side, the action has been a decidedly mixed brew with call and put activity nearly equal. Also, volume of about 8,900 contracts isn't scintillating by any means when compared to its daily average of 15,000. All told, between the technicals and what's "not" going on in the option pit, we get the feeling other traders realize GMCR isn't exactly as fresh as it once was. 

  

One bearish strategy, which can profit as long as shares don't move markedly higher is the August 110 / 115 bear call spread. The limited risk position trades for about $1.30 per spread. An expiration breakeven of 111.30 means GMCR can even trade higher by an additional 3.7% thereabouts, before this special blend of bear even begins to feel the slightest heat compared to its maximum loss of $3.70 seventeen calendar days out.

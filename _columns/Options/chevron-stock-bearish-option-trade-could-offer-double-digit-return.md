**Chevron** ([CVX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVX)) currently operates in an unloved industry with most investors focusing on clean energy and tech. And with Chevron stock acting weak, a bear call spread could yield a profitable trade in the options trading market.




Chevron's unloved industry is reflected in the Industry Group RS Rating of D-. Chevron stock also has a terrible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 31 and a weak [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 20.


When looking for bearish option trades, Chevron stock caught my eye based on these ratings and a potentially bearish technical setup.


Chevron Stock: Bearish Option Trade
-----------------------------------


Chevron stock currently trades below the 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages and shows a lot of distribution. That leads me to think further downside might follow.


In this situation I would look at a bear call spread using the Aug. 21 expiration for Chevron stock. A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways or even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry.


With Chevron stock, a bear call spread could be set up using the 95 strike as the short call and the 105 strike as the long call.



As of yesterday, this trade offered an 11.73% return on risk over the next six weeks.


Maximum Profit
--------------


The maximum profit on the trade would be $105 per contract with a maximum risk of $895.


The spread would achieve the maximum 11.73% profit if Chevron stock closes below 95 on Aug. 21, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless. This would allow the premium seller to keep the $105 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if Chevron stock closes above 105 on Aug. 21, which would see the premium seller lose $895 on the trade.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy in which you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


The most this trade can lose is $895 per contract.


The break-even point for the bear call spread sits at 96.05, which can be calculated as 95 plus the $1.05 option premium per contract.


For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss of 20% of capital at risk, so around $180.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Despite all the "A-ha!" bearish style headlines trying to put a lid on 2012's opening, technical-based, bullish salvo in the likes of the S&P 500, investors managed to keep Wednesday's profit-taking very constructive looking when all was said and done. A good deal of bulls' wherewithal in the face of Spanish banking jitters and cautious words on economic growth from China's policymakers might be attributed to the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX." 

  

The market's most notorious sentiment gauge finished off 3% after being up by about the same amount during slightly more cautious conditions early on in the session. In of itself, the reversal in the VIX is the kind of behavior bulls generally like to see. 

  

Reversals of this kind suggest investors are increasing their risk appetite and on the whole, selling premium with its potential for open-ended risk versus buying protection with more well-defined loss boundaries. That said and as a rule, healthier and more consistently, upwardly mobile markets typically go hand in hand with lower premiums or readings in the VIX. 

  

What's even more appealing about today's price action in the VIX is the movement is taking place underneath its 200-day simple moving average after a successful breakdown back in mid-December. After an elongated period of extremely volatile behavior, we might anticipate prices continuing to move back towards more normalized levels in the high teens to 20%. In turn, subdued price volatility is usually of benefit to directional trading and bulls in particular. 

  

In the end, there are no guarantees in trading successfully with the VIX as a standalone tool for making buy and sell decisions, whether with stock, options or a portfolio containing both types of instruments. However, in conjunction with Wednesday's VIX reversal closing narrowly below its mean-reverting 10-day simple moving average and in a very neutral position, we can't help but be optimistic for our bovine friends until conditions grow complacent on a quantifiable level.

Interest in marijuana stocks remains high — and why not? Investors expect explosive growth in coming quarters. The kind that attracts investments in marijuana stocks from institutional-quality stocks like **Constellation Brands** ([STZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=STZ)), **Altria Group** ([MO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MO)) and **Anheuser-Busch InBev** ([BUD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BUD)).


**Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)) stock is an interesting name that was white hot back in the fall. Last year, Tilray stock went on a legendary run from about 20 on July 31 to 300 on Sept. 19, a stunning 1,400% gain.


Since then, the stock has come back down to Earth along with its volatility.


Marijuana Stocks: Tilray Options
--------------------------------


An attempt to reclaim the 50-day moving average failed recently but the December lows are holding firm. There could be an option trade here in anticipation of a move back toward the November highs near 140. That would be nearly a 100% gain from the January 22 closing level of $72.


Option prices are still rich due to elevated [implied volatility](https://www.investors.com/research/options/options-trading-picking-the-right-strategies/). So, buying just a straight call has some additional risk. We could cut back on that risk by using a different strategy. A vertical call spread on Tilray stock could offset some of the volatility risk while still allowing participation on the upside.


A vertical call spread consists of buying a call and selling another call at a higher strike price with the same expiration. The risk is limited. You can't lose more than what you paid for the spread. The maximum gain is the difference between the strike prices minus the cost of the spread.


We could see buying a June 2019 70/120 call spread for a total of about $1,000 per spread. This consists of buying the June 70 call and simultaneously selling the same number of contracts for the June 120 call. The maximum gain if Tilray stock moves over 120 by the June expiration is $4,000 per spread. That's $5,000 for the difference between the strike prices minus the $1,000 cost of the spread. The most that could be lost on this trade is your original outlay, around $1,000 for one spread. A 4-1 return/risk ratio isn't too bad. You can always close the spread before expiration to take profits early or to mitigate risk.

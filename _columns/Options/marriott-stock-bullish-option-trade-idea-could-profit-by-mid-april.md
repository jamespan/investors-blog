**Marriott International** ([MAR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAR)) is the leading stock in the Leisure-Lodging industry group and is currently above rising 21-day, [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). 




According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Marriott stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 78 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 86. 


Investors who think MAR stock will stay above the 21-day moving average for the next week or two could look at a short-term bull put spread.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. 


Selling the April 14 put with a strike price of 165 and buying the 160 put would create a bull put spread. 


This spread was trading on Friday for around $1. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $100 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $400. 


That represents a 25% return on risk between now and April 14 if Marriott remains above 165.


Risk If Stock Closes Below 160 At Expiration
--------------------------------------------


If Marriott International closes below 160 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $400. 



The break-even point for the bull put spread is 164. That's calculated as 165 less the $1 option premium per contract. 


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 11, which means it is a similar exposure to owning 11 shares of Marriott stock. This exposure will change over time as the stock price moves. 


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1 to $2, I would consider closing early for a loss, or if MAR stock price closed below 165. 


With earnings due in mid-May, this trade should have no earnings risk, unless the international hotel chain gives early guidance. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

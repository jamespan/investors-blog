IBD 50 constituent **Nuance Communications**  ([NUAN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NUAN)) broke out Thursday from nothing short of a classic four-week long flat base to fresh all-time highs on strong, above-average volume. And then along came it's disappointing after hours earnings announcement which included unwanted highlights such as a 2 cent profit miss, subpar growth of 20.4% and management issuing mixed, bracketing FY12 guidance.

  

Obviously the base was faulty. All kidding aside, bulls rightfully enough involved in the pre-earnings breakout had plenty of options available. Specifically, we're talking about the use of calls or puts, maybe in conjunction with stock or as standalone spreads, which could have limited the gap damage compared to the never-set-in-stone, 7% - 8% stop loss. In this instance, the small and manageable loss was exceeded by about 5% for an opening drop of 12% from the proper buy point. That's "bad", but not wholly destructive and more importantly, it could have been a good deal worse and there's always next time to consider.

  

  

One option and stock strategy employed by many bulls and maybe something to consider in the near future for the next latest and sometimes less-than-greatest breakout is the collar strategy. Shown above and using last night's close is a 4x February 29 put / 33 call collar. The position is established by purchasing 400 shares, buying 4 put contracts and selling 4 out-of-the money calls to finance the protective put. 

  

This spread, already bullish by design, was positioned slightly more so by giving more room between the stock and the call relative to the put versus shares of NUAN. This of course wasn't the right position by design and we only compounded the losses suffered by a collar in leaning a bit longer. Still, with a definitive loss of just $500 versus the nearly $2,000 for a bull simply riding 400 shares naked long from last night's close, that certainly has our attention for more than a few good reasons.

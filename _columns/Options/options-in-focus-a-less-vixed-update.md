Entering the last half hour of trade, bulls haven't managed to roll up their proverbial sleeves and gotten to work following much stronger-than-expected jobs data. That said, with only very modest losses confined to the inside candle variety and given Friday's less-than-friendly credit market drivers from across-the-pond, all told, the action looks more than a bit constructive. 

  

Additionally, not only have all the majors held their ground above 200-day simple moving average support, the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" has continued to flash signs of a market looking forward to more price stability on the heels of a very volatile fourth quarter of trading. 

  

Intraday, the VIX is off about 3.8% near 20.70%. The price action puts the notorious sentiment gauge back in a testing position of recent multi-month lows after shaping a countertrend rally centered on its 10-day simple moving average while staying below its 200-day simple moving average. 

  

Net, net and as discussed on Wednesday, current readings in the VIX continue to hold promise for bulls. Despite Friday's rising Spanish debt yields and a slumping euro currency, the VIX has failed to take notice and perk up. Instead of fear and loathing of over Europe's credit market scene and when weekend holding risk could become an issue, traders have collectively opted for a more steady and optimistic outlook without getting ahead of themselves too quickly.

  

As the VIX nears 20%, the gauge is closing in on the upper boundary of more historically normalized pricing which we see as in the high teens to about 20%. So close to being inside that range and mindful of those not-so-long ago levels in the historically feared over 30% rangeâ€”are we pushing the optimism button a bit too hard? 

  

We won't know for certain without the benefit of hindsight, but with the VIX not showing signs of short-term complacency in relation to its 10-day simple moving average, I'd say Wall Street certainly seems to like uncertainty these days.

IBD 50 constituent **Momenta Pharmaceutical**  ([MNTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNTA)) saw what appeared to be bullish affirmation for its shares in its options Wednesday. Whether the spied approval is a nod towards MNTA's two-week long handle constructed in the right side of its deep corrective "V" shaped base, fundamentals, its upcoming earnings in early February or maybe all three or something else, isn't entirely clear. 

  

A bit more transparent, one large trader put up a spread consisting of roughly 2,900 March 17 puts for $0.90 per contract and about 4,600 March 23 calls priced for $0.40. The put volume is nearly identical to existing open interest and could represent a closing of a position. However, with the ratio favoring a larger amount of calls (1.6 calls to 1.0 puts), the premiums involved and no existing open interest in the call; our interpretation is the initiating party has put up a bullish ratio risk reversal.

  

A bullish ratio risk reversal using this combination of surrounding money strikes would sell 1 put for every 1.6 calls purchased. Below, we're looking at a scaled down version using -29 puts x 46 calls. With the fore-mentioned prices of $0.90 and $0.40, this would amount to a credit of roughly $0.25 per spread. In between the strikes the trader would eventually capture the credit at expiration. On any potential moves to the downside in shares, the trader holds rather large risk as this is a long delta strategy. Below the 18 put strike, the position is long the equivalent of 290,000 shares of stock if no action is taken by expiration. 

  

  

From 18 to 23 the trader could at any given time be facing profits or losses during the life of the position based on where the stock is in relation to the strikes. Ultimately and as mentioned, if shares remained in this range, come expiration the credit would be captured as both contracts would go out worthless. And above 23, the trader becomes long the equivalent of 460,000 shares. That's a bit more than 15% above any proper buy points based on our labeled handle. Nonetheless, we don't mind saying some trading plans and risk graphs still look more constructive than others.

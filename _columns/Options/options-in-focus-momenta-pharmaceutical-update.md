IBD 50 constituent **Momenta Pharmaceutical**  ([MNTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNTA)) tumbled nearly 21% Thursday when all was said and done by the closing bell. The technical hit was triggered by surprise approval allowing for **Watson Pharmaceuticals**  ([WPI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WPI)) partner Amphastar to launch a generic version of Momenta's drug Lovenox. 

  

On the option side, trading was rather heavy for a second-straight session as volume surged to nearly 11,000 contracts but far removed from yesterday's potentially scud-like, rather than accurate heat-seeking, option action.

  

Thursday's jockeying for position concentrated more than 90% of its activity in the front-month February contact. On the other hand, Wednesday was all about a large ratio risk reversal executed 2,900 x 4,600 with March 17 puts and March 23 calls. The side that positioned bullishly, using long calls financed by the short put, received a credit of about $0.25 per spread. 

  

Given MNTA's position between strikes, the credit received for bulls, the company's standing in the IBD 50 and its technically strong, two week long handle construction within its deep corrective "V" shaped base, we determined the action represented a bullish play in front of its earnings in February or maybe "something else" which as noted, wasn't entirely clear to us. 

  

"Doink?" We may have gotten this one wrong and the informed money could have purchased the puts and sold the calls. Coincidences of this type largess usually don't deserve the benefit of the doubt. However, while we'd like the Securities and Exchange Commission to snoop around, we're not wholly certain this time around that a snake or shark was suited up as a bear.

  

  

Maybe we're wrong again? While we're not necessarily a fan of this type of structure, some quantity of stock may have been involved in the transaction. If that was the case, this would have radically changed the risk and reward dynamics. As we didn't check for prints in the stock, that's certainly possible.

  

Also interesting, despite the move, neither side of the trade appeared willing to take any profits to the bank or take their lumps as a tax write-off based on the action in March on Thursday. But if some stock was involved, and as shown above, maybe there was nothing to do after allâ€”and a reason why there looked to be no second round of activity in March. At the end of a very big day for some bulls and bears in MNTA; the spread, if executed delta neutral with stock, yielded a big ol' bagel in the P&L for both sides of this position.

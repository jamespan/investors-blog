The market remains in a confirmed uptrend, but things are looking a little extended on some measures.




Traders with a lot of bullish exposure may want to start hedging their bets by adding some bearish option trades.


**United Health** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) stock is one that could be a good candidate given the stock is below declining 21-day and [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).


For the last month, UNH stock has been unable to cross back above the 50-day moving average as that level has proved to be a strong resistance point.


UNH stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 24, an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of just 13 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 76, making it a good potential candidate for a bearish option trade.


An easier spread trade for those starting out is a bear call spread.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiration.


UNH Stock Bear Spread Profits In A Wide Range
---------------------------------------------


On UNH stock, a March expiration bear call spread could be set up using the 330 strike as the short call and the 340 strike as the long call.


I would look to sell that spread for $3.50 or higher depending on where the market trades today.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $350 per contract with a maximum risk of $650.


The spread would achieve the maximum 53.85% profit if UNH stock closes below 330 on March 19. In that case, the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the trader to keep the $350 option premium as profit.



The maximum loss would occur if UNH stock closes above 340 on March 19. That would see the premium seller lose $650 on the trade.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk defined strategy and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss of $300 or if UNH stock closed above 330.


UNH earnings are scheduled for April 21, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

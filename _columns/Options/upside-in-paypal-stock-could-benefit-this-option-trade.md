**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is ranked No. 1 in its industry group at IBD. And with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 96 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94, the stock is one of the strongest in the market.




After a huge run-up in PayPal stock, momentum may carry it a bit higher yet, but maybe not too much higher.


In a situation like that, I like to trade a diagonal call spread. This trading strategy involves selling a near-dated call and buying a longer-dated call.


The ideal scenario is when the stock rallies to just below the short call right before expiration.


Selling the call with an Aug. 21 expiration and 220 strike price and buying the Sept. 4 225 call would cost around 65 cents, or $65 per contract.



That is the maximum risk on the downside. The maximum risk on the upside is equal to the difference between the strikes plus the premium paid.


PayPal Stock Option Strategy Not For Beginners
----------------------------------------------


With the strikes being $5 apart, that makes the risk on the upside $565.


The profit zone occurs between around 205 and 226, but the catch is you don't want the stock to get to that level too quickly.


As I mentioned, it's an advanced strategy and not recommended at all for beginners, but might be an interesting one to follow along with.


I would set a stop loss of around 25% of capital at risk, so around $140, or if the stock rallied up above the short call at 220.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

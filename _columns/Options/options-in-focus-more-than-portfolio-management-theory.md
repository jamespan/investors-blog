For traders with maybe more than a couple growth stocks and possibly in names which have less-than-adequate put and call liquidity, the choice of portfolio protection, other than a stop-loss, may seem out of reach or even out of the question. However, real protection is available indirectly if one looks to the broader market for help. By finding one's overall portfolio dollar exposure to the broader market with the help of beta, then using an instrument such as the SP-500 and its very liquid options, the trader can hedge the portfolio with the proper amount of insurance with a simple long put position.

  

"What's Beta you ask?" Beta is simply a measure of how a stock moves in relation to the broader market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock in question has a history of tracking the market in percent terms, both up and down. One name typically very much in-sync or in-tune with the daily ups and downs of the major averages is computer device goliath Apple (AAPL). Unsurprisingly, with its stock movement so closely-correlated to the likes of the S&P 500, AAPL shares currently maintain a very close or nearly matching beta of 0.91.

  

The beta value can be found on Yahoo! Finance under a stock's "Key Statistics" page. Readings well-below 1.0, like with many utilities names, are less volatile. Stocks which have beta values greater than 1.0, as one might expect to find with growth stocks, generally see greater percent swings up and down compared to the broader market. For instance, No. 1 ranked Questcor Pharmaceutical (QCOR) within the IBD 50 currently has a beta of 1.60 which implies it's 160% more volatile in percent terms than the SP-500. Thus if the index dropped 1.0%, we'd expect QCOR to be down 1.60% to keep the relationship intact.

  

While a bit more complicated and an index hedging strategy doesn't guard against company-specific risks, it is an alternative to simply having a stop loss in mind and ultimately, no steadfast guarantees of getting filled near one's ideal exit point. So, how's it done? Let's say you have $50K in four growth stocks and each one has a Beta of 2.00. In order to make an effective put hedge for this portfolio's real market exposure, the trader would multiply the dollar risk of $50K by the Beta of 2.00. The resulting figure of $100K is the portfolio's Beta value or risk exposure and the amount the trader would want to hedge.

  

Using the **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) and shares near $136, one purchased ATM put contract is the equivalent of $13,600 in protection, minus the cost of the put itself, which provides this type of portfolio security. Thus, for a portfolio with a Beta value or risk exposure of $100K, the trader could purchase 7 contracts to come up with a simple yet effective hedge that covers, in theory at least, about 95% of the systemic market risk ($13,600 x 7 = $95,200) embedded in the portfolio.

  

With premiums not too far off recent five year lows and when compared to underlying market volatility, protection is still quite affordable overall based on current CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" levels near 18%. What's more, with traders having the availability to let a simple long put strategy protect a portfolio with short-term Weeklys, Quarterlies or regular monthly contracts in the S&P 500; the decision to look at this kind of portfolio insurance makes all the more sense and likely cents for a diverse but similar group of traders always looking to manage risk more effectively.

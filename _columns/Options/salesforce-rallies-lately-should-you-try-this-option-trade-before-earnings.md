**Salesforce** ([CRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM)) had a nice day Wednesday. It rallied 3.3% in above-average turnover and closed near the high of the day. [CRM stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/crm-stock-buy-now/) also crossed above the all-important [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/).




Earnings results are set for release May 27. So, let's take a look at a strategy called a pre-earnings diagonal call spread.


A diagonal call spread involves selling a near-term dated call and buying a longer-dated, further out-of-the-money call.


The idea is to have little to no risk on the downside and a nice profit zone on the upside.


Let's take a look.


CRM Stock: An Earnings Season Option Play
-----------------------------------------



With earnings on May 27, we could look at selling the May 28-expiring call option with a 240 strike price for around $1.20 and buying the June 11-ending 250 call for around $1.15.


The trade would generate $5 in premium, which would mean no risk on the downside.


The maximum risk for the trade would be the difference between the strike prices x 100 less the premium received. So in this case, $995 would be the maximum risk, and this would occur above a stock price of 270.


The worst-case scenario for the trade in CRM stock? Watch for a sharp rally in the first few days of the trade. A slow rally is OK, provided Salesforce doesn't get above 240.


The maximum profit can only be estimated at around $750.


The trade starts with a slightly negative [delta](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) of -5, but that could switch to positive delta after a few days if the stock doesn't rally too much.


Controlling Risk
----------------



I would set a stop-loss if CRM broke above 240 and I would also close the trade before the earnings announcement.


Salesforce has a mixed bag of ratings. They include a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 64, an EPS Rating of 98 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 26.


Diagonal spreads are more of an advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


Please remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

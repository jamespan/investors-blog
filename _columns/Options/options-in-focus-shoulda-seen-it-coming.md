We're going to take a wild stab in Wednesday's closing minutes and tell bulls it's time to hunker down in the near-term. Some investors of course are still on the sidelines awaiting a confirmed follow-through day. However, for those bulls that dare to play a bit differently, six days of higher highs, percentage gains of about 10% and confirmation from the VIX that short-term bulls are too complacent means a likely consolidation is in order. 

  

"Time, price or both?" Some type of consolidation work appears all but written in stone as the VIX has not only tested its range lows of the past couple months at 30%, but that level has historically proven to be a hazard to bulls, before market conditions, most often improve. 

  

In our current situation, the testing in the VIX is coming from above as traders have been dealing with rather extraordinary underlying volatility in the market over the past couple months. That said, don't let the broader average's higher highs all lined up in a row fool you into complacency just yet. While linearly pleasing to bulls, the price action is also still highly volatile and well above normalized returns typically realized in the market.

  

Further and perhaps most menacing in the short-term is seven days into the rally and the VIX, the market's most notorious gauge of sentiment, has stretched 17% below its 10-day simple moving average. As a mean-reverting instrument and in conjunction with the test of 30%, we're not screaming "Look out below!" but we do see a strong situation suggesting buyer's remorse for today's bulls over the next couple days. And if bulls don't receive a confirmation of a follow-through day sometime soon, even a late but not too late signal, our short-term concern could prove a good deal more treacherous.

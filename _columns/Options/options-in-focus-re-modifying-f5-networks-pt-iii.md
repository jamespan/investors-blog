**F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) was likely on more than a few option radars today in heavy trading. With time still on the clock, more than 58,000 contracts have changed hands compared to its daily average of 12,600. The big driver today appears to be more about bulls trying to scrounge around for bargains in names left out of the market's most recent leg up and one which continues to defy gravity.

  

As for shares of FFIV, the recently clipped growth stock is pressing gains of four straight sessions into five Monday in an attempt to recoup a bit more of its debilitating earnings-related plunge of about -21%. Late in the session though, the price action is on track to establish a rather weak looking close shaped like a gravestone doji candlestick. 

  

In conjunction with shares having reclaimed just more than 38% of its bearish price gap and Monday's pending reversal candle setting up below both 50-day simple moving average and prior price support around 129 a share; it's time to revisit a recent trade idea with an adjustment better suited to current market conditions. 

  

As part of a back-to-back update on an illustrated bull vertical position Jan. 21, we adjusted FFIV's spread into a bullish modified "closed wing" all-call long condor, as shares graciously hit a described initial price target for reigning in risk. That position as of this afternoon is shown below. 

  

  

Currently, the limited-risk position is enjoying profits of $825 versus its maximum take of nearly $1,400, if shares were to back and fill a little bit into expiration. In lieu of what's technically been described and seeing how on January 21 we expressed we'd like to secure an even stronger adjustment if shares gave us the opportunity to do so against stiff resistance in the 120 to 125 area; two improved spreads to consider, by our estimation, are shown below.

  

  

The one spread is simply taking our modified call condor and selling one additional 120 / 130 bear call spread in order to secure a classic / standard-looking all-call long condor. The second spread idea adjusts the position into a standard bear call spread positioned at the 120 and 130 strikes by selling the two Feb 105 / 115 bull call spreads for $9.35 out of a possible maximum credit of $10.00. I prefer the latter spread myself as it allows for profitability no matter what occurs in the next nine trading sessions. 

  

From a design standpoint, the bear call fits in better with my technical view as well. As you may have guessed by how I've described FFIV's technical picture, I happen to think shares will lose ground heading into expiration. However, I'm also not so bearish that I'd be willing to forfeit gains entirely if proven wrong by some less-mad money bulls.

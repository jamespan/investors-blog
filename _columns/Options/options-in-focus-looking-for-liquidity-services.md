Number 1 ranked **Liquidity Services** ([LQDT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LQDT)) from the IBD 50 operates various online auction marketplaces for surplus and salvage assets in the US according to Yahoo Finance. Unfortunately for option traders, the same provision of liquidity and making a market for unwanted risk hasn't filtered into its listed calls and puts.

  

Checking the option board intraday and surrounding near-the-money strikes are showing quotes of mostly 50% to 100% wide between the bid and ask of individual calls and puts. In the most extreme situations, such as the February 35 put, traders looking to either hedge shares such as with a married put position or maybe looking to initiate a targeted purchase have a quoted market of $1.05 bid / $3.70 ask, to cause one to reconsider such plans.

  

Virtually non-existent open interest shows today, despite the market's own less liquid ways during the holiday week, isn't a fluke. So what gives? Shouldn't the highest ranked stock on the IBD 50, sport some institutional interest for its options? You might think that to be true, but our best guesstimate is the action or lack thereof is tied mostly to LQDT's ultra-low float of just 21.04 million shares, roughly 5% short interest statistic and attached short ratio or days-to-cover figure of 4.10.

  

At this stage, even if there were interest on investors, it's likely to be short-lived. Market makers have no economic incentive to make a better market in what amounts to much larger-than-normal risk given a very tenuous short stock, hard-to-borrow situation. And for any potential customers looking to make a trade that risk looks to be all the greater, even if they think they have the inside skinny.

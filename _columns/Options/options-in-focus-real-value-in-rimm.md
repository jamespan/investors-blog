When stock traders say there's something wrong with the market, often enough it's a biased opinion of price action having gone awry in one of their holdings. Take **Research In Motion** ([RIMM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RIMM)) for instance. During Friday's session, shares were under fairly strong pressure of nearly 11.5% after the company announced mixed Q4 results and investors opted to err on the side of caution and in keeping with management's lowered and below views outlook.

  

Personally, I see a technical convergence of support for the stock and a situation which looks a bit like an overreaction by stock traders given management's message that the company is "in excellent position to benefit from the continuing convergence within the mobile communications and computing markets." Guess what though? In the end, whether I see a couple reasons for a value play situation or otherwise; it's still only one guy's opinion. 

  

On the other hand and one not open to debate, some traders were mismanaging RIMM's other market intraday i.e. the one involving its calls and puts, if our quotes were correct. During the second half of trade I noticed the following markets as shares of RIMM changed hands at 56.89:

  

Weekly April 52.50 Call: 4.90 / 5.00 Weekly April 52.50 Put: 0.09 / 0.10

  

Weekly April 55 Call: 2.38 / 2.41 Weekly April 55 Put: 0.47 / 0.48

  

While some might think the mystery of mishandling today's option markets lay in the crush of implied volatility, which we're purposely not showing, the actual problem and potential opportunity for others was in the put / call parity relationship and how one strike in particular looked out-of-whack compared to the surrounding strikes. 

  

Look again and now focus on the April 55 / 57.5 call vertical spread or try your hand at lining up the April 55 call as a synthetic put market using shares at 56.89. In this instance and despite my proffered optimism regarding shares of RIMM, I'd have to be a hedged seller of the 52.5 call. 

  

At the listed prices, a bear vertical would work out to a "can't lose" situation of a $2.50 credit if we shaved but a penny between that contract and the 55 call. Similarly, if we were able to execute a buy-write with long stock and a short 52.5 call then purchase the matching natural put, we'd be the envy of Las Vegas. In truth, what you see is probably not what you get, but if you could, that's valueâ€”no "ifs, ands or buts" about it.

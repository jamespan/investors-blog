**Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) is a popular up-and-coming tech stock with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98. After a monster rally in early May, Twilio stock has now worked off the overbought conditions and looks ready to break out to new highs.




Twilio stock is trading above the rising 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages, which is considered a positive sign.


Implied volatility is elevated at around 56%. This means there is a lot of premium available for option sellers.


That, coupled with the potential bullish action, makes it a great candidate for a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/bull-put-spreads-2/).


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Twilio Stock: A Bullish Option Trade
------------------------------------


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wOPTIONS061720-300x170.jpg)With TWLO stock closing at 209.69 Tuesday, it makes sense to place the bull put spread below the strong support at 180.


Selling a July 17-expiring 180 put and buying a 170 put expiring the same day would generate $140 in premium, based on Tuesday's closing prices.


This trade offers a 16.3% return potential in one month, provided TWLO stock holds above 180 at expiration.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $140 per contract with a maximum risk of $860. The spread would achieve the maximum profit if TWLO closes above 180 on July 17th. In this case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the premium seller to keep the $140 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if Twilio stock closes below 170 on July 17. The premium seller would lose $860 on the trade. Lastly, the break-even point for this spread trade is 178.60, which is calculated as 180 less the $1.40 option premium per contract.


Set A Stop Loss At These Levels
-------------------------------



Looking at the chart there is clear support at 180 and if this level was broken, I would rethink the trade and potentially close it out.


Sticking to this stop loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.


If you're new to options, keep in mind that this trade could lose $860 per contract if TWLO takes a big tumble.

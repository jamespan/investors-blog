**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) is currently one of the top yielding S&P 500 stocks. So far this year, the integrated oil and gas titan is sharply outperforming the S&P 500 with a year-to-date gain of 49%. Exxon stock is also above rising 21-day and 200-day moving averages, but slightly below the 50 day. 




According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), XOM stock ranks No. 5 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 80 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 95.


Investors searching for yield can further enhance the yield on stocks such as XOM by using a covered call strategy.


When selling a covered call, the investor receives a premium and has an obligation to sell the shares at the strike price if called upon to do so.


Exxon Stock Today: Why A Covered Call Makes Sense
-------------------------------------------------



One call option contract represents 100 shares, so investors can sell multiple call options if they have a particularly large stock holding.


Over time, covered calls have the potential to increase returns while also decreasing the volatility of a portfolio.


On Exxon stock, a Sept. 16-expiring monthly call option with a 92.50 strike price recently sold near $2.70. Selling this call option would generate $270 in premium per contract and increase the annualized yield by 30%.


XOM currently pays around $3.52 in annual dividends per share. So generating another $2.70 from covered call writing in less than six weeks is quite attractive.


A Buffer


The $2.70 in premium received also gives a small buffer on the downside of almost 3%. That means Exxon stock could trade 3% lower between now and Sept. 16 and the covered call trade would still break even. The total capital at risk in the trade would be $8,789; if XOM went to zero, that's how much the trade would lose.


Please view covered calls as a fantastic way to generate extra income from a stock holding while also providing some downside protection.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of even a blue chip such as Exxon stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

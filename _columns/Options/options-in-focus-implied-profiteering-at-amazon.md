It's always tricky business as to how stock investors will react to a report. That point was brought home in spades with **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) in Wednesday's session. Last night, along with musing about the fickle nature of investors, we also went into more serious detail about AMZN's implied pricing for the April Weeklys options, which suggested traders collectively expected a roughly two-thirds chance shares of AMZN would remain within about 7.50% of last night's closing price. 

  

With current intraday gains of 6.25%, premium bulls and bears are mostly seeing a wash on the P&L as positioning relates to the then ATM straddle. Bulls of course take the long contract side of that bet while, as a general rule, more professional money bears are typically positioned short the delta neutral volatility play. 

  

That said, this morning and out the gate, the pin action was an entirely different story with the shorts enjoying some very strong paper gains. The Weeklys April 185 call / 180 put strangle opened in fast money "prints and pieces" around $2.00 to $2.20 compared to last night's $8.60 closing price. Shares opening rather flat inside the strikes, implied volatility getting crushed from the low 80s into the high 30s to low 40s and time decay all combined into one very decent gift for that special breed of shorts. 

  

Of course and as the prints can attest, far from everyone sitting on a nice sized paper profit, managed to get out at those prices. For one, shares did quickly begin to forge a path higher. However, "buying to close" from $3 to $4 was certainly available and easier to come by if one so chose. Traders however didn't have time to enjoy a late morning toast at the Bull & Bear, if they wanted those profits locked up either. 

  

In the end or at least near Wednesday's chapter close, the strangle has expanded back in value towards last night's closing price and as noted, is essentially a push for both sides of the position. While implieds are systematically lower, the 185 call is now intrinsically deep in-the-money and acting as a negative factor due to another breed of traders "handling" directional breakouts on an altogether different sort of risk graph.

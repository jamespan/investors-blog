One FANG company has taken a tumble lately, but it could provide a contrarian opportunity for savvy option traders. Netflix stock is still one of the strongest in the market year to date. And despite no longer being a member of [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint), the megacap entertainment play still shows a Composite Rating of 96, an EPS Rating of 98 and a Relative Strength Rating of 83.




In the past few quarters, **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) has shown a habit of declining after an earnings announcement. In fact, over the past 12 quarters, Netflix stock has declined by an average of 5.2% in the week following earnings (not including the move on earnings day).


The stock shows strong support at the 460 level in recent months. So let's take a look at a potential bull put spread option trade for investors who believe that price level will hold.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Construct A Bullish Netflix Stock Option Trade**
--------------------------------------------------



Traders who think Netflix stock will continue to hold above 460 could look to sell a Nov. 20-expiring 460 monthly put and buy a November 450 put.


As of Friday, this spread was trading for around $2.70. This means a trader selling this spread would receive $270 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $730.


That represents a 37% return on risk between now and Nov. 20 as long as Netflix stock remains above 460.


If Netflix stock closes below 450 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $370.


Conservative traders maybe prefer to wait to see if Netflix stock comes down a bit further in order to get a better price for the option spread.


How To Trade Options: Where To Consider an Exit
-----------------------------------------------


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 457.30. Calculate it as 460 less the 2.70 option premium per contract.


However, for this trade if Netflix stock price dropped below 460, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

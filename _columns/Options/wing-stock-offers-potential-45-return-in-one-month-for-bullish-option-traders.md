**Wingstop** ([WING](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WING)) stock was [Friday's IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/wingstop-stock-sets-up-to-take-flight-again/) and boasts impressive ratings.




According to the I[BD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), WING stock is ranked No. 2 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 98 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97.


Today, we're looking at a bull put spread. As a reminder, a bull put spread is a defined risk strategy, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


Trade Works If Stock Rises, Goes Flat Or Even Drops
---------------------------------------------------


This type of trade will profit if WING stock trades sideways or higher and even sometimes if it trades slightly lower.


With Wingstop trading around 185, if we use the May 19 expiration, we can sell a 165 put and buy a 160 put for around $1.55.


Selling this spread would generate roughly $155 in premium with a maximum risk of $345.


If the spread expires worthless, that would be a 44.92% return in one month provided WING stock is above 165 at expiration.


Risk Of Losing $345
-------------------



The maximum loss would occur if Wingstop closes below 160 on May 19. That would see the premium seller lose $345 on the trade.


The break-even point for the trade is 163.45, which is calculated as 165 less the $1.55 option premium per contract.


I would set a stop loss if WING stock drops below 172. Otherwise, another good rule of thumb is to limit the loss to the amount of premium received. In this case, that would be $155.


Sticking to this stop-loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.


Wingstop is due to report earnings in early May, so this trade would have earnings exposure if held until then.

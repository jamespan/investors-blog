**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) stock is showing some impressive ratings with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 95 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92.




SQ stock is currently 13% below the 52-week high and 4% above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The stock also holds the No. 1 ranking in the Credit Card/Payment Processor industry group.


I'm bullish on the stock and will be looking at an April bull put spread.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish SQ Stock Option Trade**
---------------------------------


Traders who think SQ stock will not drop below 220 could look to sell an April 16 220 put and buy an April 16 210 put.


Yesterday, this spread was trading for around $2.10 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $210 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $790.


That represents an 26.58% return on risk between now and April 16, as long as SQ stock remains above 220.


If SQ stock closes below 210 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $790. I would set a price alert if the stock drops below 230. At that point I would either close the trade, adjust or hedge.



The break-even point for the bull put spread is 217.90 which is calculated as 220 less the 2.10 option premium per contract.


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 7 which means it is a similar exposure to owning seven shares of SQ stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


Earnings for SQ stock should not occur before May 25, so this trade would not have earnings risk.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

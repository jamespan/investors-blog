When traders see simultaneous prints get put up in two option contracts, there's the inclination to take the trade as the opening or closing down of a positional spread. However, there's also the possibility the action could represent an adjustment. One such transaction which was put up as a spread, but in theory at least could be a protective adjustment for an existing bull, occurred in **Cavium Networks** ([CAVM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAVM)) Wednesday. 

  

One of the market's current, loved growth stocks, shares of CAVM broke out yesterday from an undercut double-bottom base. Good volume accompanied the price move, but investors backed off by day's end with shares finishing in the lower half of the trading range and slightly below the proper buy point. 

  

In Wednesday's session and despite the market's own early push into slightly higher territory, shares of CAVM failed to notch fresh highs and winded up closing weak for a second session on above-average volume within an inside candlestick. 

  

Is this the end of Cavium's technical journey from its January 2009 lows of about $7 a share and worthy of racking up gains in excess of 525%? Personally, this uninvolved market observer and option strategist doesn't know. And today's largest trader in Cavium's options may not either. But, if a roll was involved, they won't be leaving things like profits to chance. 

  

If the trader responsible for the 2,000 or so May 45 / 40 Put spreads were already positioned as a long stockholder and in conjunction with a long protective May 40 put; they'd have had on a married put or a long synthetic call. Given CAVM's nice rise over just the last two to three weeks to fresh highs and shares just above 45, a roll to close out the 40 put, which sports slightly higher open interest of 2,600, while "buying to open" a much closer to the action 45 put in May, makes a lot of sense. 

  

This type of increased protection does cost more than a few pennies to initiate. Actually, it's more like $1.65 per spread based on current market prices. However, that's pretty close to the 30% strike distance formula for rolling used by more than a few bulls who like to guarantee their risk profile. 

  

In the end and sometimes a messy one at that, this type of advance attention to risk opens up the possibility for a more calculated "Buy, Buy, Buy!!" down the road, rather than the "Sell, Sell, Sell!" sometimes necessitated without the use of protection that only options offer.

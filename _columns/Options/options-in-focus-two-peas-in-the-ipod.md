Sometimes in life things can look the same on one level, but there might be key features which dictate the potential user to make a choice based on his or her own preferences or risk being disappointed. In the world of option trading, one such comparison can be found in the long butterfly versus the long calendar or time spread. 

  

To illustrate our apples-to-kind, sort of comparison weâ€™re looking at none other than **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Shown below, we're looking at a 1x Weeklys April 530-560-590 call butterfly. Priced late in Tuesday's session for $6.30, the spread maxes out its profit potential if shares remain at the 560 strike come Friday with an in-a-perfect world gain of $23.70. That's simply the width of either of the two embedded vertical spreads minus the debit to enter as the bull call vertical is fully in the money and the bear call vertical loses 100% of its value. 

  

  

Now take a look at a very similar-looking risk / reward profile for a 1x June / May 560 calendar spread shown below.

  

  

As with the long butterfly which sold two Weeklys April 560 contracts, this position also hopes AAPL will remain at 560 over the next three days so it can collect premium on its sale of one contract and see the spread expand in value. But with the time or calendar spread though, the trader is long a further out contract. That's important, especially in a situation with earnings being priced in on Wednesday and one, which will find richly priced implieds dropping lower overnight in an estimated volatility crush. 

  

Not only is a volatility crush a negative for the time spread, but its lesser max profit versus the butterfly is actually reduced even further depending on how hard of a crush might ensue. As the two spreads are more or less fetching the same cost to initiate, wouldn't that dictate the superior spread is the butterfly? Not entirely, as it is dependent on how much of volatility crush we're estimating and in a static implied volatility environment, the long calendar has the wider break-evens. That said and after tweaking the IV's on a platform like Platinum, the calendar makes even less sense and cents to this option observer.

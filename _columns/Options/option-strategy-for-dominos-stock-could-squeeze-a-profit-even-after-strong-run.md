**Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) has been a strong performer all year and recently worked off overbought conditions through a mild pullback. Domino's stock remains aloft after it spiked recently.




DPZ stock shows a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 85, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 74, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 86 and sits above rising [21-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/) and 200-day moving averages. 


Implied volatility on Domino's stock is 23%, which is near the lowest levels seen in the last 12 months. That means options are cheap compared with the previous 12 months.


When that occurs, it is better to be a net buyer of options rather than a seller. 


Meanwhile, one way to trade Domino's stock from the long side in a defined-risk way is using an option strategy known as a bull call spread. 


You create a bull call spread when you buy a call and then sell a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside. 


Additionally, going out to December expiration, a 540-strike call option traded around $25.10 Tuesday, and the 560 call was around $17. 


Bull Call Spread For Domino's Pizza Stock
-----------------------------------------


Buying the 540 call and selling the 560 call creates a bull call spread for Domino's Pizza stock. The trade cost would be $810 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100), and the maximum potential profit would be $1,190 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid). 


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if Domino's stock closes below 540 on Dec. 17, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $810 premium paid. 



The cap for potential gains is above 560. So, no matter how high DPZ stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $1,190. 


In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $810 to $400, or if the stock dropped below 510, I would consider closing early for a loss. Consider taking profits if the stock reaches 550 to 575. 


Trade Involves Earnings Risk
----------------------------


Domino's earnings are set for late October, so there would be earnings risk with this trade — unless it was closed before then.

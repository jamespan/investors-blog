Sixteen days into the market's rally attempt and with nary a follow-through day, a confirmed downtrend is looking more and more like a good ol' less-than-jolly bear to this option strategist and soothsayer of the technical tea leaves. 

  

In the end my view is nothing more than an opinion, albeit oneÂ that does its best to remain informed in a determined increasingly difficult market to predict directionally with any great authority. But that's just me. 

  

That all said and maybe if you're in agreement, to stay ahead in this game of investing while allowing for a bit of margin of error to creep into our price charts; limited risk option spreads are a means to that end.

  

  

One slightly more advanced but well-contained position to illustrate what can be done with options is what I'd call a risk vertical or maybe a capped bearish risk reversal. The illustration shown above incorporates a bear call spread and a bear put spread, which is the heart and soul of this more grizzly spread. This particular construction uses a fairly well-centered, two-lot January 122/125 bear call spread and January 118/115 put spread on the **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) with shares just above 120 for a small credit of $0.38 per spread. 

  

Come expiration, if the S&P 500 remains between the two purchased strikes of 118 and 122, this spread would capture the initial credit on both spreads or $76 in total. Above the highest strike, both spreads lose their max, but since a credit was received, the strategist would be out the difference in strike price i.e. 3 points minus the credit of $0.38 per spread or $2.62. 

  

And should Santa's sleigh continue to ransacked by those Grinch-like bears or less-than-ho-ho-hopeful bulls, this softer delta bear would eventually enjoy the full benefits of this strategy. At expiration and below 115, the trader would enjoy a payday of $3.00 per spread plus the credit of $0.38 for a grand total of $3.38 or $676 on two spreads.

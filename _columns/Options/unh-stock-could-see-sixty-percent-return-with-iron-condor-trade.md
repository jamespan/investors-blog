**UnitedHealth Group** ([UNH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UNH)) is seeing a trend of higher implied volatility. That makes it a good candidate for an iron condor trade as the higher volatility in UNH stock leads to increased option premiums. You can also set your strikes wider to increase the probability of success.




Iron Condor On UNH Stock
------------------------


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay without too much movement in price.


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Aug. 19 expiry on UNH stock, we sell the 470 put and buy the 460 put. That spread traded around $2 yesterday. For the bear call spread, we sell the 550 call and buy the 560 call. This spread traded around $1.75 yesterday.



In total, this iron condor on UNH stock generates around $3.75 per contract, or $375 of premium. 


Profit And Loss Levels
----------------------


The maximum profit is the premium received on the iron condor. Ideally, both spreads expire worthless and you keep the entire premium. That happens if UNH stock finishes between the short strikes of 470 and 550 at expiration.


In fact, as long as UNH stock stays at 466.25 to 553.75 at expiration, you still make money. That gives you a pretty big range to remain successful on the trade. You calculate these profit ranges by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


As for the risk, you start losing money if UNH trades outside of those profit ranges at expiration. Your maximum risk occurs if UNH stock falls outside of the long strikes, below 460 or above 560, at expiration.


To calculate your max loss, subtract the premium from the width of the strikes. There is $10 between the strikes of each spread on UNH stock. Subtracting the premium and multiplying by 100 gives you a max loss of $625 (10 – 3.75 x 100 = $625).


To figure out your return on risk, take your max profit ($375) divided by the maximum risk ($625). This iron condor trade has the potential to return 60%.


If price action stays neutral, then iron condors work well.


Managing The Trade
------------------


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $375, so we could set a stop loss equal to the premium, or a loss of around $375.


Another way to manage the trade is to set a point on the chart where the trade will be adjusted or closed. That could be around 480 on the downside and 510 on the upside.


On [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), UNH stock is ranked No. 4 in its industry group and has stellar ratings with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 89 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 95. 


Earnings are coming up UnitedHealth before the market open on July 15, so this trade does have earnings risk.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

The cost of buying options to protect against swings in Brazil's real is at its lowest level in almost a year as the central bank unwinds its swaps program, which had helped investors hedge their exposure to a weakening currency.


Three-month implied volatility fell 0.03 percentage point on Wednesday to 17.46%, the lowest level since July 30, 2015. The real advanced 0.2% to 3.2894 per dollar at 12:10 p.m. in Sao Paulo.


Brazil's new central bank chief, Ilan Goldfajn, aims to reduce the stock of foreign-exchange swaps to zero from $60 billion while relying on the country's reserves to provide confidence to investors, according to an interview with the Financial Times. Since March, Brazilian policymakers have sold $46.8 billion of reverse currency swaps to stem the real's world-beating gain and reduce the stock of swaps outstanding. While unwinding the contracts is unlikely to change the direction of the real, it can mute volatility, Morgan Stanley's strategists led by Gordian Kemen wrote in a report published Wednesday.


"The central bank has signaled a willingness to intervene between 3.20 and 3.35, but stopped unwinding above that level," they wrote. "The main impact of BCB intervention will be seen more in volatility levels than BRL spot levels."


Brazilian assets have soared this year on prospects that a new government may be able to restore confidence and curb a record budget deficit. Morgan Stanley recommends investors buy the real when it dips.


The cost of insuring Brazilian bonds in the credit default swaps market for five years declined 0.7 basis point to 294.7 basis points, the lowest level since July 31 last year.


Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2018, a gauge of expectations for interest rates, dropped 0.02 percentage point to 12.68%.

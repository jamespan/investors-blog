The energy sector pulled back Wednesday after a solid two weeks of outperformance. 




The VanEck Oil Services ETF ([OIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OIH)) was down 3.9% on the day, and traders who think the rotation out of energy stocks may have some legs could look at a bear call spread on this ETF. 


I chose this ETF because it typically performs poorly when energy stocks fall, and there is less earnings risk than trading an individual stock like **Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)). 


That being said, the top two holdings in OIH are **Schlumberger** ([SLB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLB)) at 19.28% of the portfolio and **Haliburton** ([HAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HAL)) at 13.24%, so earnings on these two stocks could have a large impact on the price change in the ETF. 


Let's look at how a bear call spread might be set up on VanEck Oil Services.


Setting Up Bear Call Spread In OIH Stock
----------------------------------------


As a reminder, a bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call. 



The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways, and even if it trades slightly higher. You want to make sure the ETF stays below the short call at expiry. 


On OIH stock, a November expiry bear call spread could be set up using the 235 strike as the short call and the 240 strike as the long call.  Wednesday, that spread was trading for around 70 cents. 


If executed at that price, the maximum profit on the trade would be $70 per 100-share contract. The maximum risk is $430. 


Maximum Profit Of 16%
---------------------


The spread will achieve the maximum 16.28% profit if OIH closes below 235 on Nov. 19, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the trader to keep the $70 option premium.  


 The maximum loss will occur if OIH closes above 240 on November 19, which would see the premium seller lose $430 on the trade. 


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy, and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance. 


A stop loss could be set if OIH trades above 220, or if the spread value rises from 70 cents to $1.70.


Strategy Not For Those Bullish On Oil Sector
--------------------------------------------


As this is a bearish position, traders who think OIH stock will continue moving higher from here should not enter this trade. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

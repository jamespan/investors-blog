"After the earnings report, I think this stock will either soar or collapse."

  

What good is such a forecast? It can be very good, if you know how to trade straddles.

  

**Straddle Defined**   



Buying a straddle involves the simultaneous purchase of one call and one put with the same strike price, same expiration date and same underlying stock. Graph 1 illustrates a long, or purchased, 80 Straddle on stock XYZ. This straddle is created by purchasing one XYZ 80 Call for 4.25 and, simultaneously, purchasing one XYZ 80 Put for 4.75 for a total cost of 9.00, or $900, not including commissions. The stock price is assumed to be $79.

  

Graph 1 (See chart)

(XYZ 80 Call, 4.25; XYZ 80 Put, 4.75)

  

"Straddle" is an appropriate name, because it means taking both sides at the same time, and this strategy has the potential of profiting from either rising or falling prices in XYZ stock. If the price of XYZ rises above 89.00 (the upper break-even point), then the call makes more than the put loses. If it falls below 71.00 (the lower break-even point), then the put makes more than the call loses.

  

**The Benefits and Limitations of P/L Diagrams**   



Expiration profit and loss analysis is beneficial, because it reveals the stock prices where the best possible and worst possible outcomes occur. The maximum possible loss of a long straddle is the total premiums paid plus commissions. This loss occurs if both the call and put are held to expiration and not exercised. In this case, the options are said to expire worthless.

  

The limitation of expiration analysis is that strategy performance prior to expiration is not estimated. Option traders who intend to close a position prior to expiration need to estimate the impact of three factors that affect option prices, (1) the stock price change, (2) the change in time to expiration and (3) the change in implied volatility.

  

**Change in Stock Price**   



First, option prices do not change as much as stock prices change. Options have "deltas" which estimate how much option prices change for a one-dollar price change in the underlying stock, assuming other factors remain constant. Call deltas are positive (stock price up, call price up) and put deltas are negative (stock price up, put price down). In order for straddle purchasers to make money, the stock price must rise or fall enough so that the rise in one option price more than offsets the decline in the other.

  

**Time Erosion**   



Second, it is well-known that option prices decline as time passes toward expiration. Time erosion has a double impact on straddles, because two options are involved. For straddle purchasers, the stock price must change fast enough to offset the time erosion on two long options.

  

**Changing Implied Volatility**   



Third, implied volatility can change when the market’s assessment of the likelihood of a large stock price swing changes. Implied volatility is the volatility percentage that is "in the market price of an option." Conceptually, volatility is the market’s assessment of risk in a stock’s price. When the "market is nervous," then implied volatility is "high." When the "market is complacent," then implied volatility is "low." The difficulty for options traders is determining what a "high" level is and what a "low" level is. A change in implied volatility, like time, has a double impact on straddles.

  

**Analyzing Scenarios**   



Now let’s get specific. Return to the XYZ 80 Straddle purchased for 9.00, and assume XYZ is trading at $79 per share. Also assume that today is 45 days to expiration, and implied volatility is 40%. Finally, assume a forecast that the price of XYZ stock will rise or fall by $10 per share in one week and that implied volatility will decrease to 35%. Given these assumptions and the forecast, it is possible to estimate how the price of this straddle will change.

  

The following analysis is accomplished with the Options Calculator tool that can be downloaded free-of-charge from the Web site of The Chicago Board Options Exchange at http://www.cboe.com under the TOOLS tab.

  

After entering the known information to create the "current situation," the next step is to change the stock price from 79.00 to 89.00, the days from 45 to 38 and the volatility from 40% to 35%. Scenario #1 in Exhibit 1 shows that the result of this process is an estimated straddle price of 11.00.

  

**Exhibit 1**

  

Estimated    Straddle    Values    Under Three Scenarios  
Current       Scenario    Scenario    Scenario  
Situation       #1             #2             #3   
Stock Price    $79.00      $89.00    $69.00       $79.00  
Strike Price    80              80             80             80  
Dividend Yield    0%       0%             0%             0%  
Implied Volatility  40%    35%           35%          30%  
Interest Rates    1%          1%             1%             1%  
Days to Expiration 45       38             38               38  
                  Original          New          New          New  
                  Outputs         Outputs      Outputs      Outputs  
80 Call Value: 4.25             10.25       0.40          3.20  
80 Put Value: 4.75             0.75           11.10       3.90  
80 Straddle 9.00               11.00          11.50       7.10

  

Scenario #1: Stock price up $10 in one week and implied volatility 35%  
Scenario #2: Stock price down $10 in one week and implied volatility 35%  
Scenario #3: Stock price unchanged in one week and implied volatility 30%

  

The next step is to estimate the value of the straddle if the price of XYZ declines to $69.00. Remember that our forecast for the stock price was for either a $10 rise or fall. Scenario #2 in Exhibit 1 shows that, with a stock price of $69.00, 38 days to expiration and implied volatility of 35%, then the XYZ 80 Straddle price is estimated to be 11.50.

  

A third step is to estimate the outcome if the forecast is wrong. A "wrong forecast" in the case of a long straddle is little or no change in stock price. Scenario #3 in Exhibit 1 assumes the stock price is unchanged after one week has passed and that implied volatility falls 10% to 30%. The result is a straddle price of 7.10 and a loss of 1.90, not including commissions.

  

**Making a Decision**

  

Is this a "good trade"? If you feel the risk of investing $900 plus commissions and losing $190, according to Scenario #3, is worth the possibility of making $200 if the stock rises $10 or making $250 if the stock falls $10, then the answer is, "Yes." If you have a different opinion of the risk/reward, then the answer might be, "No."

  

**Summary**

  

If you want to trade a straddle, then you should concern yourself with three things, your forecast for the price change in stock price, the time period and the level of implied volatility. By testing scenarios, you can estimate the results of your forecast and potential profit and risk.

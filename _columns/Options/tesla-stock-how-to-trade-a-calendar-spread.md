It may be tough to gain much traction with the [market in correction](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/). But let's say you have a neutral stance on the market. A calendar spread in Tesla stock could take advantage of the passage of time, as long as the stock doesn't move much in either direction.




Calendar Spread On Tesla Stock
------------------------------


**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is a  [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank) stock with a lot of cushion. Tesla stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 72 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96. It traded around 970 yesterday.


To set up a calendar spread, you sell a short-term option and buy a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Usually, this is done with monthly options but it can also be done with weekly options.


With Tesla stock trading around 970 yesterday, setting up a calendar spread at 970 gives the trade a neutral outlook.


The Dec. 31 call option at 970 would bring in $4,770 in premium with a sell. That's the short-term option. Then buy the Jan. 21 call on Tesla stock, again at the 970 strike, which cost about $7,470 yesterday.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $2,700 per spread. This is also the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is $3,000, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they would use puts.


Profit, Loss And Break-Evens
----------------------------



The idea with the trade is that if Tesla (today's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/tesla-stock-breaks-key-support-levels-market-sell-off-elon-musk-sales/)) remains around 970 for the next few weeks, the option sold will decay faster than the bought option. That allows the trade to be closed for a profit.


The break-even prices for the trade are estimated with Tesla trading at roughly 900 and 1055. These can also change slightly depending on changes in implied volatility.


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


For a trade like this, I would set a profit target of 30%, and I would set a stop loss if TSLA stock breaks through either 900 or 1055.


Calendar spreads are a neutral option trading strategy. Bullish traders might consider something simpler like a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/heres-a-way-to-profit-from-adobes-earnings-report-with-options-but-risk-is-notable/) trade in **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)). Or even a [cash secured put](https://www.investors.com/research/options/irm-stock-could-provide-extra-yield-with-this-options-strategy/) on **Iron Mountain** ([IRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRM)).


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

In-flight media provider **Gogo** ([GOGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOGO)) faces another crucial test when it reports "key conclusions" from its business review after the market closes Thursday.


The stock has fallen 59% this year after the company withdrew a slew of financial forecasts and saw its corporate rating cut by Moody's.


Shares have continued to slide ahead of Thursday's announcement and the subsequent conference call Friday. Guggenheim lowered its estimates for Gogo. Morgan Stanley said the company may start cutting costs.


There's no question that Chicago-based Gogo has a lot on its plate, according to Northland Securities analyst Paul Penney.


"Top of mind for us and many investors is the recapitalization plan, as their already overstressed and levered balance sheet can't absorb continued losses and negative free cash flows," Penney said Wednesday in an email to Bloomberg News.


Option Bets
-----------


Options investors may also be betting on further declines in Gogo shares. Put volume spiked to more than nine times the 20-day average Wednesday. The July $4.50 contracts changed hands about 8,100 times compared to open interest of 201. Gogo closed at $4.59.


Short interest accounts for a whopping 60% of float, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. That's up from its 2018 low of 46% set in February.

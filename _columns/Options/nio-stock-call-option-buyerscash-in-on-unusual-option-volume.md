Nio stock jumped 22% Wednesday, and call option buyers were able to cash in on the massive movement throughout the day.




**Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) stock is ranked No. 2 behind only **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) in the carmakers industry group, with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99.


Call option volume went through the roof Wednesday, with many call strikes for November experiencing volume of over 15,000 contracts.


However, the contract with the highest volume was the Oct. 16 call with a 25 strike price, which saw volume of over 168,000.


Total option volume in Nio stock was just under 2 million, with 81% of options traded being calls.


To put that into perspective, the next highest was **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) with just under 300,000 options, 58% of which were calls.


Drilling into the Oct. 16 25 strike calls, we can see that the first trade of the day occurred at a price of 35 cents and traded as high as $2.29 late in the day. The previous day, that same contract was trading for just 3 cents.


**Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) was another stock showing unusual option activity Wednesday, with over 160,000 contracts traded. That's 6.5 times higher than normal. Eighty-four percent of the volume was in the calls, which is no surprise given Baidu stock was up 7.1%.


Baidu is currently showing a Composite Rating of 90.


What's clear is that some big traders made a killing on Nio and Baidu call options Wednesday.


It's not often you can catch moves like this, but when you do the rewards can be enormous.


For this reason, traders may want to start paying attention to unusual option volumes.


Huge demand in calls can push up the option price, just like stocks. But it's also related to the underlying price of the stock, so it's like getting a heads-up that a stock is making a big move and then trying to ride that move.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

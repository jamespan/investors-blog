A few weeks ago, [we looked at a bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/datadog-stock-today-this-bull-put-spread-in-ddog-could-place-a-juicy-47-return-in-your-lap/) trade on **Datadog** ([DDOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DDOG)), which worked out well. So today we're looking at a similar idea on **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) — specifically another bull put spread in the options of MRVL stock. 


Traders willing to bet that MRVL stock will stay above 60 for the next five weeks could look at a bull put spread that would expire March 15. This type of trade will profit if MRVL stock trades sideways or higher and even sometimes if it trades slightly lower.


As a reminder, a bull put spread is a defined-risk strategy, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


**MRVL Stock Today: The Setup**
-------------------------------


With MRVL stock trading at 71.94 during Thursday afternoon trading, and if we use the March 15 expiration, based on recent trading we can sell a 60-strike put option and then buy a 57.50 put for a total net gain of around $0.42 per set of contracts, or $42. Selling this spread would generate roughly $42 in premium with a maximum risk of $208.


If the spread expires worthless, we would bag a 20% return in five weeks — provided MRVL stock holds above 60 at expiration.

**Risk Vs. Reward**
-------------------


The maximum loss would occur if MRVL stock closes below 57.50 on March 15. In this situation, the premium seller would lose $208 on the trade. 


Also, the break-even point for the trade stands at 59.58. Calculate it as 60 less the $0.42 option premium per contract. I would set a stop loss if the loss is equal to the amount of premium received, which in this case would be $42.


Sticking to this stop-loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.


**Mostly Top Notch Ratings**
----------------------------


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), MRVL stock ranks No. 7 in its group. It shows a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 91, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 57 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Marvell is slated to report January fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 27.

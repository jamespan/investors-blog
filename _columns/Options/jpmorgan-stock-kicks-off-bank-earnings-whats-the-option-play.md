It's amazing how quickly earnings season comes around and we're in the thick of it again today with some of the big banks reporting before the market open, JPMorgan stock among them. The [short straddle](https://www.investors.com/research/options/short-straddle-lulu-stock-generates-option-premium/) players watch these releases eagerly.


JPMorgan Stock Trades The Tightest
----------------------------------


**JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM))**,Â Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) and **Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) all reported before the bell today.


The options market priced in a 6% move for JPMorgan stock, a 6.5% move for Citigroup stock and an 8.2% move for Wells Fargo stock as of yesterday's close.


Short straddles held over earnings allow the opportunity for profits to be made if the stock stays within a tight range after the announcement.


The trade involves selling an at-the-money put and an at-the-money call and then buying those options back soon after the earnings announcement.


With the earnings reports in now, take a look at how the three stocks performed. Have they made a larger move than expected or a smaller move? So far, JPMorgan stock had the tightest trading.


Winning The Short Straddle Option Trade
---------------------------------------


A smaller than expected move means the straddle sellers win and a larger than expected move means the straddle buyers win.


The risk with the trade occurs when the stock makes a large move which takes the stock out of the expected range.


The risks are potentially unlimited and with so much uncertainty around earnings numbers, I'll be taking a very conservative approach this quarter.


Options are a zero sum game and whenever there is a winner there is also a loser.


Short straddles should only be tried by experienced option traders due to the potential for unlimited risk.

Amid the current [stock market in a correction,](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rides-biotech-happy-rebound-but-heres-why-the-market-has-not-yet-turned/) it can be a little unnerving holding onto stocks that you believe in. After all, bear markets usually come after everything. In this environment, investors might be wise to look to reduce some of the risk of stock ownership through options trading, specifically by selling covered calls.




Options Trading With Covered Calls
----------------------------------


When selling a covered call, the investor owns shares of a stock but receives a premium to allow someone else to buy them at a specific price before a specific date. Remember, in options trading the seller of a call has the obligation to sell the shares at the strike price if called upon to do so.


One call option contract represents 100 shares, so investors can sell multiple call options if they have a particularly large stock holding.


Over time, covered calls have the potential to increase returns while also decreasing the volatility of a portfolio. The premium collected helps offset downside risk if the stock goes lower and can turn even a low yielding stock into a decent income play.


Let's take a look at **Clearfield** ([CLFD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CLFD)) as an example.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), CLFD stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99. The strong ratings are putting CLFD stock at the top of the [IBD 50](http://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/).


It tried to make a run above its 50-day moving average line last week. It's getting turned away today but a covered call with options trading might have taken some of the sting out from the downturn. Here's how this option strategy works.


Covered Calls On CLFD Stock
---------------------------


A Oct. 105 call option traded on Friday for around $6.85. Selling the call means the option trading brings in $685 in premium per contract.


That option premium was around 7% of the purchase price of the stock at the time. Think of it as providing a small buffer against a declining stock price.


As Clearfield stock dropped around 6% today, you are still ahead on the trade from Friday. The drop in the stock price is more than offset by the options trading premium received.


Say CLFD gets worse from here as it gets closer to the Oct. 21 expiration. You will lose money on the position.


In fact, the total capital at risk in the covered call trade was $9,779 at the close yesterday. That's 100 shares bought at 104.64 minus the premium received. If CLFD stock went to zero, that's how much the trade would lose. But consider that owning the stock outright means you would have had the full $10,464 at risk without the offset. And after Oct. 21, you could sell another covered call and offset your risk even more.


Covered calls in option trading are a fantastic way to generate extra income from a stock holding while also providing some downside protection.


What's the catch? If CLFD stock takes off above 105, you won't participate. Instead of having the unlimited potential for gains, your trade profits are capped above 105. Still profitable at that level, but could leave a lot on the table.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the covered call idea before implementing the strategy.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Entering the Investors.com website today and I was immediately greeted not with a handle pattern but an ad telling me to put some shine into my portfolio with **Silver Wheaton**  ([SLW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLW)). To be perfectly honest, if it was late February I would have been thrilled technically to have received the heads-up. At that time, the stock had carved out a nifty three-weeks-tight pattern around a key and prior weekly pivot high from early November and looked poised to move higher. 

  

But now? After rallying over the course of several sessions to gains just north of 8%, shares have tumbled nearly 20% and about 12% below our fore-described and admittedly, non-orthodox three-weeks-tight setup. Now and for that matter, then as well, had I been privy to the setup which turned into a real setup for those less than fleet of foot, I'd personally have looked to SLW's options in determining my risk and reward. 

  

Along with attention paid to a more fickle daily price chart, making good use of SLW's except option liquidity which includes very active penny increment markets and one-point-strike distances, which allows for concrete limited-risk position profiles and profit opportunities just not possible with long stock along. 

  

We'll admit, in the case of SLW if we hadn't acted quickly we'd very likely be down some coin. Nonetheless, unlike a potential long stockholder still holding onto hope alone and a decent-sized paper loss, we could still be actively mining for profits with the likes of a dynamic collar. That particular strategy which is comprised of equal parts long stock, long protective put and short calls has limited downside risk and even allows bullish traders the ability to accumulate shares on strong corrective moves like witnessedâ€”if of course, one is of the mind the weakness is temporary. 

  

It's true this kind of value-oriented bull could wind up digging him or herself into a deeper hole before anything truly precious is unearthed. There's nothing that says shares of SLW are forbidden to drop 10% or even more from current levels. But at 20% from highs, we can't blame those convinced of the long-term worth of this technical setback, for increasing their position up to 20% when defined risk via the collar is a part of the plan. 

  

While this sort of strategizing is well removed from handling proper buy points espoused by many growth traders, it does make enough sense. Whether cents and dollars are to follow isn't known for certain. But we can say with confidence that getting back to even and then ahead of the game are available to bulls wanting to learn how to play another type of defensive game during a bout of March Madness away from the main stage.

If all gaps eventually get filled, what happens thereafter? Stock traders in **Hewlett-Packard**  ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)) have stopped and paused in consideration of that event on three separate occasions since late October. Currently, the latest technical reflection has resulted in very narrow and tight lateral conditions while testing the gap's fill for the last eight sessions. 

  

On the option side of things though, a different sort of bull was spied today making some modestly "ho-ho-hopeful" overtures in HPQ's calls. In a handful of deeper strike calls which maintained decent open interest and matching put markets of less than $0.12, traders were spied putting on the dividend play in front of Monday's ex-date. The action amounts to an attempt by well-capitalized and favored customers to capture the quarterly payout at the expense of the others not playing the game. 

  

How the strategy works is traders' position with verticals, diagonals or buy-writes, exercise their long contracts where applicable and then "ho-ho-hope" they don't receive assignment on the held short strike call. In a nutshell, the trader wishes to wake up with a buy-write on his or her sheets consummated by the exercise of the long call, while the existing open interest forgets or doesn't wish to convert their own deep contract into stock for the quarterly payout. 

  

With the fore-described conditions met, a trader waking up with the buy-write on their sheets will have established it for the price of the payout, which in the case of HPQ amounts to the same risk as selling a put for $0.12 per contract. That may not sound like much, but when the real put trades for something like $0.04 or $0.05, then it can amount to somethingâ€¦something like maybe the January 13 call. 

  

In today's dividend play quest, 30,000 contracts were put up as what I'll guess was a buy-write swap negotiated between two traders for even money. With open interest of 5,000 in the call and the real put priced for $0.04 mid-market, if the trader(s) isn't assigned on the short call side of the buy-writes transacted, they'll have essentially sold the put synthetically for $0.12. Theoretically, that means they're up $0.08. Now wishfully multiple that amount by the 5,000 open interest and there's the ever, ever slim possibility of $40,000 edge at stake. 

  

In the real world and in this particular instance where shares of HPQ are at 28 and a closer to the money strike such as the 17 put is offered at $0.05, there's also the possibility of locking in a guaranteed profit and establishing a bear vertical for a small credit which could always amount to a good deal more if shares were to plunge below the strike. Remember though, until some sort of hedge such as buying another put is made, a buy-write, even a special one using the dividend as its basis and put on for a little something extra, still needs to be appreciated for the risk involved.

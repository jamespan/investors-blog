A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price. In today's example, we'll look at a calendar spread trade for Roku stock.




Usually, calendar spreads are done with monthly options, but they can also be done with weekly options.


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias in which case they would use puts.


Implied volatility for **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) is toward the lower end of the 12-month range. Remember that calendar spreads benefit from a rise in implied volatility.


Roku Stock: Calendar Spread
---------------------------


With Roku stock trading around 300, setting up a calendar spread at 300 gives the trade a neutral outlook.


Selling the January 15 300 call option will generate around $2,320 in premium. Buying the February 19 300 call will cost around $3,440.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $1,120 per spread and that is the most the trade can lose.



The estimated maximum profit is $1,250. But that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if Roku stock remains around 300 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay at a faster rate than the bought option allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


Break-even Prices
-----------------


The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 271 and 335. But these can change slightly depending on the impact of changes in implied volatility.


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


For a trade like this I would set a profit target of 20% and I would set a stop loss if Roku stock breaks through either 271 or 335. I would risk not more than 2%-3% of my capital.


Roku is due to report earnings in early February, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

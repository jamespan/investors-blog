IBD Leaderboard constituent **SolarWinds** ([SWI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SWI)) was up handily on Tuesday following a sympathetic reaction to its mixed, but mostly stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Quite possibly failing to handle the report nearly as well in our humble estimation, a likely group of stock bulls getting long shares of SWI in front of the report during Friday's cup-shaped breakout.

  

Monday's heavier volume, bearish engulfing candle which closed about 1.5% below the buy point of 33.78 and just shy of four points or some 12% from that day's opening highs; left a lot to be desired for bulls previously contemplating holding shares through the report. 

  

On the other hand, we suspect a married put combo in front of that type move would have been envied when all was said and done Monday. Given a legged combo of the synthetic long call position could have allowed bulls to sit confidently through the earnings event knowing their worst case scenario was $0.10, we certainly can't blame those traders that would be appreciative. 

  

With one eye on the breakout and the other probing Solarwinds options Friday afternoon, we discussed and illustrated this strategy when the February 35 put was priced for $1.30 and bulls holding shares from the pivot of 33.78 were up on paper by a very similar $1.29 with shares at 35.07.

  

  

As discussed, in virtually eliminating all the assumed breakout risk taken, the cost for this sort of adjustment was the potential forfeiture of up to $1.30. That's the cost of the put, which if shares simply stayed at 35 through expiration, however unlikely, would have eaten into the paper gains. 

  

In the end, some traders simply long stock from Friday may have stayed the course and they're all the better for ignoring Monday's technical insecurities. Those who did are up about another $1.30 from the 35 area from our original analysis. They'd also be up $0.85 or $85 per 100 shares over the guy or gal, which took action and hooked up for a quickie marriage. 

  

By our own reckoning and given the latest and kind of greatest action, we think the married put looks to make more sense and cents as a dynamic short-term collar ready which would be ready for adjustments on the upside, while sporting an even stronger defense on the downside. I guess you could call that type of action as having another friend with benefits on top of our old one.

With about an hour left in the session, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is seeing some fairly heavy option action on more than double its daily average with a total tally of 280,000 contracts. The IBD 50 component, the market's second largest capitalization and seemingly recession-proof computing gadget giant is off about -1.7% in sympathy with the S&P 500's own decline of -0.90% on the latest oil supply / geopolitical concerns. 

  

Much like the broader market as well, Apple's price action could have investors wondering if they're seeing a top develop. As part of their own active buying and selling efforts, option traders are doing their typical thing, which amounts to showing slight favor to the calls by a margin of 1.4-to-1 over puts and a good deal of the action concentrated as one might expect in the surrounding money strikes of the front couple months. 

  

For bulls long the stock that aren't willing to exit the stock or willing to call a top within Apple's long-standing but fairly typical these days, uptrend, the use of a collar might be considered a good way to protect those gains while still looking to capitalize on any potential upside in the stock. 

  

Volatility in Apple isn't what it used to be, but shares do still move around 7% a month on average and through three to five of its listed five-point wide strikes. This can amount to a good deal of constructive hedging opportunities each month and allow one to limit risk during even the most adverse price moves. There's even the potential to do something a bit more dynamic like accumulating shares without dipping further into one's pocket like some other mad money "Monbacky!" tactics would require. 

  

  

Shown above and to illustrate a very enviable collar position, we're looking at a trader that purchased shares on a key test of $300 and 50-day simple moving average support back in November and during a similar "Is it or isn't it?" situation.

  

Now, with shares up about 18% to 19% from the purchase price and feeling a bit less secure about the possibility of a third test of the 50-day simple moving average; the trader has decided to purchase the April 345 put and finance the bulk of its protective qualities with the sale of the April 365 call.

  

This particular collar is tight in comparison to underlying volatility near 7% but I don't think anyone could fault the idea of keeping one's winner's profitable and still allowing for a bit of faith without holding on to too much hope at the same time.

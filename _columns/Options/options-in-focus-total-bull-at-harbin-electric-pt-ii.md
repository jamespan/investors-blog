"Do as we do, not as we say?" That appears to have been the correctly diagnosed situation in erstwhile growth stock **Harbin Electric**  ([HRBN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HRBN)) and compliments of some unimpressed option action one week ago. Last Friday we wrote about option traders continuing to be disbelieving of a pledge by the company's CEO that in cahoots with Abax Global Capital, he intended to take Harbin private for $24.00 a share. 

  

The deal pricing compared to shares up near 16.50 in volatile and somewhat appreciative trade would of course result in a huge windfall for positioned bulls, if talk were to actually turn towards actual action. No such luck for those that took the bait, but those traders did appear to be in the minority as evidenced by HRBN's smart money, option activity. 

  

Heavy and well bid put action with very light, relatively speaking, trading in HRBN's out of the money calls suggested, to us at least, that traders were, at a minimum, still more concerned with protecting any long stock and more likely, still betting on lower prices to come. 

  

Less than a week later, a bearish analyst call from Citron Research which raised doubts over the proposed $750 million "go-private" offer, sent shares plummeting more than 50% to a low of 5.82. Harbin Electric, spearheaded by its Chair, refuted all the allegations, much to the surprise of probably nobody familiar with these type situations. 

  

What's next for HRBN? Personally, I don't have an axe to grind but it seems appropriate to now steal the, never really is, line of "the easy money already being made." However, that isn't preventing traders still betting on the ugly side of capitalism as evidenced by Friday's heavily-traded July 5 put. 

  

More than 7,600 contracts have traded compared to open interest of 3,200 on an eye popping premium of $1.25 and orbital implieds of 380%. With no other July or later dated puts hitting the tape, it would seem buyers of protection are in charge of the order flow. 

  

On the other hand, some heavy call action of 3,100 on the 5 strike could represent a conversion / reversal arbitrage with the puts. As well, more than 5,000 of the out-of-the money 10 calls have traded and which could be part of a risk reversal, strangle or even collar. Net, net the easy interpretation or maybe just the lucky one seems much less available to this strategist and my only outlook the expectation of more outsized volatility as in the cards.

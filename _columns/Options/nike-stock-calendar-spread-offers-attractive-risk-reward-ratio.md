A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price. And a trade looks good for Nike stock.




Usually this is done with monthly options, but it can also be done with weekly options.


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias in which case they would use puts.


Nike Stock Option Trade
-----------------------


In today's example, we'll look at a calendar spread trade on **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) stock.


With Nike stock trading around 98, setting up a calendar spread at 100 gives the trade a slight bullish bias ahead of its June 25 earnings report.


Selling the July 17 100 call option will generate around $370 in premium. Buying the July 31 call will cost around $445.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $75 per spread and that is the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is $250 but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.

The idea with the trade is that if Nike stock remains around $100 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay at a faster rate than the bought option, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 93 and 108, but these can also change slightly depending on the impact of changes in implied volatility.


Setting Profit Target/Stop Loss
-------------------------------


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


For a trade like this I would set a profit target of $25 per spread which is 33% and I would set a stop loss if Nike stock breaks through either 93 or 108. I would also not risk more than 2%-3% of my capital.


Calendar spreads are a neutral option trading strategy. Bullish traders might consider something simpler like a long call, similar to [this trade in Adobe stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/long-call-option-trade-for-adobe-stock-returns-59-percent-in-one-month/) or this [bullish call spread in Amazon stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/amazon-stock-be-ready-potential-breakout-with-this-bullish-option-strategy/).

The market has had a great run in recent months and for those with a lot of bullish exposure, adding some bearish option trades can be a good way to hedge some of that exposure.




**Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) was down over 4% on Friday and put in a bearish engulfing candle. So it could provide a nice bearish candidate.


Intel stock broke below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and is still less than 6 points above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/). If the stock drops back town to that level, bearish option trades will do well.


A bear put spread is a debit spread. That means that we need to pay the premium to open the trade.


On Intel, a bear put spread could be set up using the 43 strike as the long put and the 38 strike as the short put for the June 21 expiration.


Max Potential Gain $320
-----------------------


This trade would cost around $180 per contract, with a maximum potential gain of $320.


To achieve the maximum profit, this trade would need Intel stock to drop 13.64% between now and expiration on June 21.


The break-even point for the bear put spread is 41.20. That's calculated as 43 less the $1.80 option premium per contract.


If Intel stock drops early in the trade, it may be possible to make a profit at slightly higher prices.


At expiration, if Intel stock is trading above 43, the entire spread would expire worthless. The trade would lose 100%, or $180.


How To Exit Intel Stock Option Trade
------------------------------------



For a trade like this, I wouldn't bother with a stop loss. Either the trade works or it doesn't. So I would trade an appropriate position size in case I suffered the full 100% loss. Alternatively, you could set a stop loss at 50% of the premium paid.


Because this is a bearish position, traders who think Intel stock could move higher from here should not enter this trade.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Intel is ranked No. 4 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 79, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 68 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 85.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

It's strange to see a "new tech" company like **Dropbox** ([DBX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DBX)) underperforming in recent months. Since the Nasdaq's follow-through day on April 6, DBX stock is up around 12.5%, compared to a 41% gain for the Nasdaq.




DBX stock, a former member of the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/), has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94 and an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 99. But a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 53 points toward middling price performance.


Looking at the chart for the cloud services provider, there is strong support at 19 a share, and traders who think this level will hold could look at an option strategy known as a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Bullish DBX Stock Option Trade
------------------------------


Traders who think Dropbox stock will continue to hold above 19 could look to sell an October 19 put and buy a 17 put.


As of Tuesday, this spread was trading for around 35 cents, which means a trader selling this spread would receive $35 in option premium for a 100-share block, and would have a maximum risk of $165.



That represents a 21.21% return on risk between now and October 16 as long as Dropbox stock remains above 19.


If Dropbox stock closes below 17 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $165.


This is where an options spread has an advantage over uncovered strategies. With a bull put spread, you always know the worst-case scenario even if Dropbox stock tanks.

CLOSE




For this trade, if Dropbox stock price dropped below 19, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Dropbox's next earnings report is due in early November, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

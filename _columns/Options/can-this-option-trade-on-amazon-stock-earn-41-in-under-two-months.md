With the stock market shifting back to a [confirmed uptrend](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-rallies-powerfully-amid-election-chaos/), Amazon stock was among the leaders benefiting. The combination of technical and fundamental strength sets it up as an option trade with a bull put spread.




Combination Of Fundamental And Technical Strength
-------------------------------------------------


After finding support multiple times at 3,000, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) jumped back above its 21- and 50-day moving averages yesterday in an impressive performance.


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-amazoncom-inc-amzn.aspx) shows a lot of green circles on the checklist for Amazon stock, and it goes well beyond just the technical action. The fundamental analysis shows strength as well and is reflected in a best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Amazon stock also earned a spot on the [IBD 50.](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) There's a strong bullish case behind the numbers.


Implied volatility for AMZN stock is currently 39%, which places it in the 57th percentile of its readings in the last twelve months. Since Amazon reported earnings in late October, there is no earnings risk for the next few months. It's a good candidate for a bull put spread.


Bullish Amazon Stock Option Trade
---------------------------------


A bull put spread is a defined-risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry. To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.



On the AMZN stock chart, there is strong support around 3,000 after shares touched the level in July, September and again in the last week. Traders who think Amazon stock will not drop below 3,000 could look to sell a 3,000 put and buy a 2,990 put, both with an expiration on Dec. 18.


As of yesterday, this spread was trading for around $2.95, which means a trader selling this spread would receive $295 in option premium. The maximum risk is $705 and found by subtracting the premium from the difference in the strike prices.


That represents a 41.8% return on risk between now and Dec. 18 as long as Amazon stock remains above 3,000.


Know The Risks
--------------


If Amazon stock closes below 2,990 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $705.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 2,997.05. You get that from taking the higher short strike of 3000 minus the 2.95 option premium per contract.


Given the strong previous support at 3,000, if Amazon's stock price drops below 3,000 I would close the trade early to keep my loss small.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Now that many Leaderboard stocks have pulled backed to near their initial buy points, an options trader might ask, "Is there is a low-cost way to make a commitment to one of these stocks without the full risk of buying stock at the current price?" The answer is a resounding, "Yes!" An options strategy known as the bullish collar allows stock-oriented investors — for a minimal cost — to position themselves for a resumed rally in a stock if they are also willing to purchase the stock at a lower price.

  

**Bullish Collar Defined**

  

A bullish collar is created by simultaneously buying an out-of-the-money call and selling an out-of-the-money put. The short put represents an obligation to buy stock, and the long call contains the right to buy stock. The short put portion of the strategy requires a margin deposit and prior approval from a brokerage firm, so check with your firm about their requirements.

  

Assuming XYZ stock is trading near $95, Graph 1 illustrates a 90-100 Bullish Collar in which an XYZ 90 Put is sold for $2 per share and an XYZ 100 Call is purchased for $3 per share. The net cost, therefore, is $1 per share. Commissions and margin requirements are not included, but they must be considered in the analysis of a real strategy.

  

**Profit/Loss at Expiration**

  

If the stock price is below the lower strike price at expiration, $90 in this example (Outcome 1), then the short put is assigned, and the call expires worthless. Assignment of a short put means that stock is purchased. The effective purchase price of the stock in this case is the strike price of the put plus the net cost of the bullish collar plus commissions, or $91 in this example.

  

If the stock price is at or between the strike prices at expiration, $90 and $100 in this example (Outcome 2), then both options expire worthless, and the net cost of the strategy plus commissions is lost.

  

If the stock price is above the higher strike price, $100 in this example (Outcome 3), then the call is exercised, and the put expires. Exercise of a call means that stock is purchased, and the effective price of the stock is the strike price of the call plus the net cost of the strategy plus commissions, or $101 in this example.

  

**Motivation**

  

The bullish collar is appropriate for investors who are willing to buy at lower prices but, at the same time, are worried about missing a rally. The short put allows these investors to commit to purchase the stock at a price that is below the current market price. The long call (partially paid for with the premium from the put) provides upside insurance that stock will be purchased if the stock rises above the strike price of the call.

  

Does the bullish collar give you the best of both worlds? Only you can decide.

  

**Current Examples**

  

Leaderboard stock **Air Lease Corp** ([AL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AL)) is roughly 4% below its 29.97 flat-base buy point. While Air Lease's most recent flat base showed only modest accumulation in the pattern, the April 25 reversal in heavy volume was a sign of institutional support. If you believe that 27.80 on the downside is a reasonable buy point, and if you want insurance that you will not miss buying on a rally above 30.30, then options give you an opportunity to take a position in AL without buying the stock at its current price of 28.88.

  

Selling the AL August 27.50-strike Put at 0.80 (80 cents per share) and buying the AL August 30-strike Call creates an August 27.50-30.00 bullish collar on Air lease. If the stock rallies higher, you are assured of buying 100 shares for each collar at an effective price of 30.30 plus commissions. If the stock price is below 27.50 at options expiration in August, then 100 shares will be purchased at an effective price of 27.80 per share. The downside risk is equal to buying AL at 27.80 per share, so don't use more bullish collars than the number of shares you are willing to buy.

  

**Lumber Liquidators** ([LL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LL)) is another Leaderboard stock. Tuesday it closed 4% above an 83.22 short-stroke buy point. The stock tried to climb above its 10-day moving average Tuesday but reversed and finished near its session low in average volume. If you are willing to buy LL 6% lower at 81.10 and if you want insurance that you will not miss buying on a rally above 91.10, then selling the LL July 80-strike Put at 2.10 per share and buying the LL July 90-strike Call for 3.20 creates a July 80-90 bullish collar on LL for a net cost of $1.10 per share plus commissions. If the stock rallies higher, you are assured of buying 100 shares for each collar at an effective price of 91.10 plus commissions, and, if the stock price is below 80.00 at options expiration in July, then 100 shares will be purchased at an effective price of 81.10 per share, which is the downside risk.

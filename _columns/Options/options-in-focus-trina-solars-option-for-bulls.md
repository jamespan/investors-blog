Back on Friday, The Big Picture made note of **Trina Solar**'s ([TSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSL)) attempted breakout from a cup-with-handle base. Unfortunately, by the close, any stock bulls having acquired shares at the proper buy point of 29.99, were sitting on a paper loss of nearly 2%.

  

While that day's late weakness could rightfully qualify as a questionable start to TSL's breakout, courtesy of oil-related supply anxieties emanating from the Middle East, Tuesday, price action was showing some decidedly more bullish promise with shares trading about 1.5% above the pivot near 30.45. 

  

For bulls, the million or maybe three-million dollar, inflation-adjusted question might be, "Does Trina have the legs to rally?" And if you're an option trader, the question of "What strategy might best fit the situation?" also deserves as much, if not more consideration. 

  

The good and maybe bad news is there is no one right way to play Trina using options. As is always the case, trader preference regarding risk and reward play an instrumental role in making a choice as to how to best position. The better news is TSL options offer a wide variety of ways to position using the company's listed calls and puts.

  

One key characteristic not to be dismissed is Trina's strong option liquidity. Near-term options trade in penny increments with an average bid / ask spread of less than a nickel, while June and September dated options generally trade with respectable spreads of $0.10 to $0.15.

  

Additionally, TSL offers one point wide strikes rather than 2.5 points between strikes. This allowance means traders can tailor design spreads such as verticals, calendars, collars, iron condors and the likes to truly match one's own expectations. In fact, even if those expectations include seeing a rather large bullish 13-month inverse head and shoulder rather than a cup-shaped base; Trina's options look to be worth exploring further.

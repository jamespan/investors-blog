Options trading strategies are a dime a dozen these days, but it's important to understand how options work before getting too aggressive with complex trades. It's best to start simple. Once you've made a couple of successful trades with either a bullish or bearish bet on a stock, you can consider other strategies.




For my entire professional life my mentor successfully imprinted two ideas onto me.


1. **Success leaves clues**: Something that is successful and has a good value will continue to demonstrate that in the clues it leaves. In the market the "biggest and baddest" clue is simply price. As price continues to rise, the stocks that are the most successful soon become out of reach for many investors.


2. **Things that are cheap are cheap for a reason**: Just because something is a low price does not necessarily mean that it is a good opportunity. There is typically a strong correlation between something's price and its value. As stocks rise, many investors try to catch a "cheap" stock, hoping it might become the next highflier.


With all-time highs recently being put in by the Nasdaq and Russell 2000, what can an investor do when he or she wants to invest in shares of high-priced stocks?


High-Priced FANG Stocks
-----------------------


As the market has risen, shares of high-quality stocks like **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)), Google-parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) have investors' attention. But all three are high-priced stocks and soaring prices have many investors sitting on the sidelines. An alternative idea for many investors may be to change investment vehicles while still participating in the successful high-priced stocks.


Options Trading Strategies
--------------------------


For many active investors, options may be a viable alternative to stock investments giving them access to top performing stocks at a fraction of the cost. When an opportunity presents itself, it often makes sense to use options as a replacement for stock.


How Do Options Work?
--------------------


To understand this concept there are two basic things to know about options trading:


1. Options allow an investor to control a stock without ownership for a fraction of the cost. This fractional cost means that the movement of the underlying stock will magnify the movement of the correlating option. This allows for a greater return on investment when the direction of the stock is correctly identified.


2. Options have many pricing components, but it is key to understand that options have expiration dates and lose value until that expiration occurs. That loss of value is often compared to a large block of ice. The larger the block of ice, for example, the slower it melts. But as the block shrinks it tends to melt at an accelerating rate. Options work much the same way. If someone purchases an option for six months, it will lose time value slowly for the first few months but accelerated as expiration nears.


What Are The Types Of Options?
------------------------------


There are 2 basic types of options: Calls and puts. While I could literally write a book on all the distinct and available options strategies, it's important to keep simple to start. Calls make money when the stock rises, and puts make money when the stock falls.


My mentor coined it like this, "Think of options like ordering a pizza. When you want to order a pizza, you pick UP the phone and CALL, and when you are done you PUT the phone DOWN. CALL UP, PUT DOWN." So an investor that is looking at a high quality stock would buy a call option as a replacement for the stock.


The Ins And Outs Of A Call Option
---------------------------------


There are a few other considerations that an investor would need to consider before purchasing a call option:


1. **Time** — When buying a call option, it makes the most sense for an investor to buy enough time for the value of the option to remain before bleeding off. So buying a 3-5-month option is best when coupled with the intention of selling that option before it reaches its final month before expiration. For example, if an opportunity is seen in July, but an investor thinks it could take one month until the price target is hit, it would make sense for that investor to buy a November option. That would be the "sweet spot" as far as time is concerned.


2. **Earnings** — Buying these options just before an earnings announcement or holding them through an earnings announcement is also not recommended. We could spend pages describing volatility and why this best practice exists, but the simplest explanation is that just before earnings announcements options prices are over inflated. When results are released, the options become deflated and lose value, even if the stock direction has gone the way it is expected.


3. **Price** — Buying a call option that is just below the current price of the stock is considered a best practice. For example, if the stock is trading at 137 and there is a 130 Call option available, this will probably be the best choice.


Call Option Makes Sense For Grubhub
-----------------------------------


Using those three best practices let's look at a pertinent example with a highly rated stock from the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) list. Here is a picture of **Grubhub** ([GRUB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GRUB)) highlighting its 99 composite rating as well as showing a pullback to a strong base.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/TEST1aa.jpg)The nearly $107.00 price of this stock may scare some investors away, even if the opportunity is a good one. For an investor to buy even 100 shares of this stock they would need to tie up over $10,000 in their account. The call option that would make sense for this option would be the September 105 call option.


The 105 call has a delta of .58, which means that the option will have a 58% sensitivity in price to the movement of the stock but at 10% of the price. This essentially gives the option five times leverage over the stock at a fraction of the cost.


This option has only 89 days until expiration, which means that ideally the investor will have hit their price target within the next 40 days or so to maximize the option's value and not suffer too much from the passage of time. By using the option in lieu of the stock, the investor has only an out-of-pocket cost of $11.10 per share, or just over $1,000 for 100 shares.


The cost of $10,700 for 100 shares of stock and $1,110 for 100 shares of the option immediately makes the latter a more viable investment opportunity for many investors.


Five Times Leverage
-------------------


If the stock moves, $1 the return on investment would be 0.93% (1/106.98). If the stock moved $1, we would expect a $0.58 move in the option (due to the .58 delta). The return on investment in that case would be 5.22% (.58/11.10). This leverage means that the option is a vehicle that is five times more efficient for the investor.


The other distinct advantage of the option is that in the extreme case the stock has a tremendous shock loss type of event, the options trader can only lose the amount invested in the option — about 10% of the amount needed for the stock.


The unfavorable qualities of options are a limited amount of time to make the movement. In addition, a movement the other way is also magnified. Options will not be the right fit for all investors at all times, but in many instances it might make sense to take the time to investigate the right tool to do the right job.

Virgin Galactic stock has rallied with other meme stocks recently. SPCE stock hit 35 on Friday after being under 15 just three weeks ago.


**Virgin Galactic** ([SPCE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPCE)) is ranked 26th in IBD's Aerospace/Defense Group by [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-virgin-galactic-holdings-spce.aspx), hurt by mediocre ratings.


With a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 47, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 44 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 71, SPCE stock hardly inspires confidence for long-term investors.


After such large price moves, it is not surprising to see that implied volatility has gone through the roof.


SPCE Stock: Implied Volatility
------------------------------


Implied volatility for SPCE stock is currently 121% which puts it in the 87th percentile of all readings in the last 12 months. To put that into perspective, implied volatility on **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is just 21%.


Traders that believe SPCE stock will come back to earth can trade that view in a risk-defined manner with a bear call spread.



A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry.


Due to high implied volatility, bear call spreads on Virgin Galactic can be placed quite far out of the money.


Let's look at an example.


Virgin Galactic: Bear Call Spread
---------------------------------


On SPCE stock, a July expiry bear call spread could be set up using the 40 strike as the short call and the 42 strike as the long call.


On Friday, that spread was trading for around 35 cents.


If executed at that price, the maximum profit on the trade would be $35 per contract on a block of 100 shares, with a maximum risk of $165.


The spread would achieve the maximum 21.21% profit if SPCE stock closes below 40 on July 16. The entire spread would expire worthless allowing the trader to keep the $35 option premium.


Risk Defined Strategy
---------------------


The maximum loss would occur if SPCE stock closes above 42 on July 16 which would see the premium seller lose $165 on the trade.

While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk defined strategy. You always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


As this is a bearish position, traders that think Virgin Galactic stock will continue moving higher from here should not enter this trade.


SPCE earnings are scheduled for early August, so there should be no earnings risk with this trade.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

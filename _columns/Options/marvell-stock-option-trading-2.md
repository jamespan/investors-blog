**Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) stock jumped recently following a [strong earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/marvell-stock-marvel-earnings-custom-ai-chips-q32024/).


Marvell is also showing a very low implied volatility rank, which means options are cheap compared to recent history. That could mean it's a better time to be an option buyer than an option seller.


Investors interested in taking some bullish exposure can do so with much lower risk by through a bull call spread.




A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to the February expiration, a 130-strike call option was trading around $2.65, and the 135 call around $1.75.


Marvell Stock Potential Profit $410
-----------------------------------



Buying the 130 call and selling the 135 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $90 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). The maximum potential profit would be $410 (the difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy, so if Marvell closes below 130 on Feb. 21, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $90 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 135. So no matter how high Marvell might go, the most the trade could profit is $410.


The breakeven price for the trade is equal to the long call strike plus the premium, which in this case is 130.90.


Managing Marvell Stock Trade
----------------------------


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 100, or if the spread value dropped from $90 to $45, I would consider closing early for a loss.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-marvell-technology-mrvl.aspx), Marvell stock is ranked No. 9 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 81, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 72 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

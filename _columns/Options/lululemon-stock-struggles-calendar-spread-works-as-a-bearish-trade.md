When looking for bearish option trade candidates, **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is one stock that might fit the bill. Last week, LULU stock broke below the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/) and then the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). 




If Friday's low gets taken out, the stock could see further downside. Assuming traders have a price target of 270 for Lululemon stock, they could look at a bearish calendar spread at that strike price.


A bearish calendar is negative delta and positive vega, so can do quite well when the stock drops.


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Use Puts For Bearish Calendar Spread
------------------------------------


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they would use puts.


Let's take a look at an example of a bearish calendar spread on Lululemon stock.


Based on Friday's closing prices, traders could sell the October 270 strike put for around $6.20, then buy the November 270 strike put for around $11.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $480 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.


If the market bounces Monday, traders might be able to buy the calendar spread for less, let's say $400.


The estimated maximum profit is $900, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility. 



The idea with the trade is that if Lululemon stock trades down around 270 in the next few weeks, the calendar spread will increase in value, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


The Trade Is Akin To Shorting Five LULU Shares
----------------------------------------------


With the market in backwardation, we are able to sell the shorter-dated put with higher implied volatility than the longer-dated put. Normally, that's the other way around.


The position starts with a delta of -5, meaning the exposure is roughly equivalent to being short five shares of LULU stock, although this will change as the trade progresses.


Lululemon stock is ranked No. 4 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 80, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 95 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 49.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Twilio** ([TWLO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWLO)) stock has a strong history of rallying ahead of its earnings announcement, and today we'll look at a pre-earnings bull put spread.




TWLO stock is in a nice uptrend with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The recent decline found support at the rising [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages are all sloping upward.


TWLO earnings are set for Feb. 17 after the close with the consensus for a loss of 0.05 per share on revenue of $453.46 million.


The options market is pricing in an 11.70% move in the stock in either direction, but this bull put spread will expire before the earnings announcement. Implied volatility is elevated on TWLO stock with an implied volatility percentile of 71%.


High volatility results in high option premiums which can be good for bull put spread traders.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish TWLO Stock Option Trade**
-----------------------------------


Traders who think TWLO stock will rally, or at least not drop by too much, could look to sell a Feb. 12 375 put and buy a Feb 12 370 put.


As of yesterday, this spread was trading for around $1.60 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $160 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $340.



That represents a potential 47.06% return on risk in nine days as long as TWLO stock remains above 375.


If TWLO stock closes below 370 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $340.


Setting a stop loss if TWLO stock breaks below 375 makes sense in this case.


Ideally the stock continues to rally in the lead up to earnings and the spread expires worthless.


TWLO stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 88, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 69 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

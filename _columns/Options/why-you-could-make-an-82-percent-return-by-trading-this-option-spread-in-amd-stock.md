**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) had an impressive Monday, finishing up 6.3%, before cooling a bit Tuesday. The stock has been a leader among key IBD stock lists, including the [Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/) and [the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/ibd50/full).




AMD stock broke out of a [double-bottom base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-buy-growth-stocks-why-double-bottom-base-fuels-strong-breakouts/) on strong volume and is showing a best-possible Composite Rating of 99, an EPS Rating of 99 and an RS Rating of 92.


With a solid technical and fundamental outlook, it could be worth looking at an option strategy known as a bull put spread.


This defined risk option strategy profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an [out-of-the-money put](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Aggressive traders could look to place the bull put spread just below the current stock price.

**Why This May Be A Bullish AMD Stock Option Trade**
----------------------------------------------------


Traders who think AMD stock will not drop below a price of 90 could look to sell a Jan. 15-expiring put option with a 90 strike and buy a Jan. 15-expiration 85 put.


As of late afternoon Monday, this spread was trading for around $2.25. So a trader selling this spread would receive $225 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $275.Â That represents a potential 81.8% return on risk in 45 days as long as AMD stock remains above 90.



As of Tuesday morning, the spread traded near $3.48, based on the midpoint between the best bid and best ask prices for each put option.


If AMD stock closes below 85 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $275.


In terms of risk management, I would close the trade if AMD stock broke below 85 before the expiration date.


When To Take Gains
------------------


Another good rule of thumb is to take profits if 50% of the return potential has been achieved in less than 50% of the time.


In other words, if the trade is showing a profit of around $110 before Dec. 23, we take profits early.


AMD does not report earnings until Jan. 26 so there is no earnings risk with this trade.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

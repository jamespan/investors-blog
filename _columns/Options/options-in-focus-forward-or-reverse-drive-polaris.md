Shares of IBD 50 constituent and all-terrain vehicle manufacturer **Polaris Industries**  ([PII](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PII)) saw some option traffic enter its front month February contract Tuesday in topping unusual volume within the IBD 50 index. 

  

Of today's 3,000 contracts and counting with a bit of time still remaining in the session, puts have found favor over calls by a margin of 1.5-to-1.0. Virtually all of that effort has been in February with about 1,800 puts trading in various out-of-the-money and at-the-money strikes ranging from 65 down to 55. 

  

Open interest in the strikes is uniformly above today's activity levels, thus conclusive evidence of opening or closing of positions isn't known. As well, relatively stable implieds since its better-than-expected results back on January 25, don't provide much of a clue regarding whether Tuesday's drivers of order flow were buyers or sellers. 

  

Based on short interest information and a dandy little first stage base-on-base weekly cup now forming a handle, our guess is the action could be tied to synthetic bullish positioning or maybe even a bullish put vertical or two.

  

What we know with a bit more authority is implied volatility is skewed modestly higher in the puts. We can confidently assume this is tied to short interest of about 8.50% and a short-to-cover value of 6.80 days according to Yahoo Finance. When and if shares of a stock become difficult to short or what's called "hard-to-borrow" or "HTB" puts will systematically trade at a premium compared to the calls. 

  

The reason for this phenomenon is due to synthetic relationships between the calls and puts and the latter contract, when hedged, avoiding any unpleasant surprises of being called away on short stock. Those long put traders, hypothetically at least, will maintain the contract hedged by long stock which can be positioned as a synthetic straddle or an outright synthetic long call.

  

On the other hand, the owner of long calls will in theory, need to hedge with short stock. The initial transaction and positioning of either a long synthetic straddle or long synthetic put is priced a bit cheaper than using the corresponding put and long stock. However, any hedging comprised of short stock could ultimately be called away by one's broker. That risk, were it to occur, could lead to uncontrolled delta or directional risk. 

  

In the end, if traders using the calls in this sort of capacity wake up one day to some unintended long deltas and directly in front of any potential avalanches in the stock. Well, it's not like they were not warned by other market riders before hopping on board.

Covered calls are a popular strategy among option traders as a way to generate additional income from a portfolio of stocks.




The only problem with the strategy is that it requires a large amount of capital, in some cases many thousands of dollars to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock.


There is an option trade that has a very similar risk profile and it's known as a diagonal call spread, sometimes also referred to as a poor man's covered call.


To execute a poor man's covered call, the trader will buy a long-term, deep in-the-money call and sell a short-term out-of-the-money call.


The long-term bought call effectively replaces the long stock position at a fraction of the cost.


Target Stock: A Moneymaking Covered Call?
-----------------------------------------


Let's look at an example.


Assuming a trader is bullish on **Target** ([TGT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TGT)) stock over the next few months. To trade a covered call, they would need to buy 100 shares of the stock at a total cost of $12,320.



A similar exposure can be obtained through buying a Jan. 21, 2022-expiring call in TGT stock with a strike price of 90. That call was trading around $37 yesterday or $3,700 which is much less than it would cost to purchase 100 shares.


The trader can then sell monthly covered calls against that position as normal.

-------------------------------------------


The downside of the trade is that gains and losses will be magnified as you are effectively trading a leveraged position.


Even though you are risking less capital, the exposure is almost the same as owning 100 shares.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

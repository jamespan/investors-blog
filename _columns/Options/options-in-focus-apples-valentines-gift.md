The broader averages received a final half hour rally in no small part compliments of the increasingly muscular **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). The ever-growing No. 1 market capitalization must-have gadgets giant notched another 1.4% onto its ticker Tuesday with shares pressing their way fresh highs and eight-straight days of gains totaling more than 11%. 

  

If ever there were a Valentine's Day gift for bulls, Apple would be in the running for the most dearly held possession. Yet, since breaking out above prior all-time highs of 426.70, shares are up over 19% without consolidating and by some technical accounts using oscillators and the likes, "Oh, Lordy!", AAPL is overbought and ripe for a pullback.

  

Last Thursday we wrote on these hallowed pages our view AAPL shares would test the $500 benchmark. It was all but a foregone conclusion. And rather quickly, shares are now about 10 points north of that level. On or in the other hand, we haven't yet seen my other price projection in which the powers that be proceed to do the "non-PC" jamming thing and disrupt bulls sinking their teeth into Apple shares too heartily. 

  

Maybe Apple shares won't break the hearts of bulls after Valentine's Day has come and gone. Nonetheless, for those that happen to be in the enviable situation of sitting on gains from lower levels, remember hedging and protecting gains before it becomes a dicier situation is available with those abundant listed call and put options and then deciding on trader apps such as: outrights, collars, verticals, stock substitution strategies and the likes and positions you're sure to like.

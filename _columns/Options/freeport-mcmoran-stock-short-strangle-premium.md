**Freeport-McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) stock displays close to the highest level of implied volatility seen for this stock in the last 12 months.


That usually suggests a time to collect rich premiums by selling options. Option traders can take advantage of that high volatility by selling what is known as a "short strangle," which involves selling an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the-money call within the same expiration date.




This trade generates a large amount of premium for the option seller, but it does come with risks. A short strangle is an unprotected trade, sometimes referred to as a "naked" trade. Naked options can be risky. They expose the trader to potentially unlimited losses if the stock makes a big move.


However, if the investor is right and the stock moves sideways, the trader gets to keep the full premium.


**How The Short Strangle Works With** **Freeport-McMoRan Stock**
----------------------------------------------------------------


Assuming a trader believes Freeport-McMoRan stock will trade sideways over the next few weeks, they could look to sell an April 17 put of 39 and an April 17 call at 43. The 39-strike put could be sold for around $1.05 and the 43-strike call could be sold for around $1.00.


Selling those two options would generate a total of $205 in premium. That is the maximum possible gain on the trade if Freeport-McMoRan stock closes between 39 and 43 on the day of expiration.


To work out the break-even price of the trade, take the lower strike price of 39 minus the total premium received of $2.05 which gives 36.95. Then on the call side, take the call strike and add the premium which gives 45.05.


This trade is a known as a short vega trade, which means if implied volatility increases early in the trade, losses could occur. 


Potential Losses Unlimited — And Higher Than Gains
--------------------------------------------------


Short strangles are an advanced option strategy, so if all that sounds confusing, it's best not to trade them. With a trade like this the potential losses are unlimited and a lot higher than the potential gains, so traders would want to be very confident that the stock is going to remain flat over the course of the trade. A stop loss could use the short strike prices as areas to exit the trade.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Freeport-McMoRan stock is ranked number 10 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 54, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 71 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 33.


Further, Freeport-McMoRan plans to report earnings in late-April, which means no earnings risk. But please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Rocket Companies** ([RKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RKT)) stock jumped 11% yesterday and call option buyers were able to cash in on the massive movement throughout the day.




RKT stock was one of the most active stocks in the options market yesterday with total volume of over 365,000 contracts. Call option volume outpaced puts by a ratio of 6-to-1. Overall volume was nearly three times higher than normal.


The contract with the highest volume was the March 19 25 strike call with volume of over 35,000.


Drilling in to the March 19 25 strike calls, we can see that lowest traded price for the day was $0.90 with the contract ending the day at around $1.70. The previous day, that same contract was trading for just $0.70.


Call Options Give Upside Leverage
---------------------------------


One of the benefits of options is that they provide leverage (this can be both a good and a bad thing).


If a trader were to buy the March 19 25 strike call, they would need the stock to rise above 26.70 (strike price plus premium paid) at expiration to be profitable.



The potential upside is unlimited which is why traders are attracted to buying out-of-the-money call options on highflying stocks. We've seen this regularly in the past few weeks with stocks like **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) and **AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)).


Long calls can be very profitable when a stock makes an explosive move higher, but they can also lose value very quickly if the stock drops or stays flat.


RKT stock currently has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 68, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 92 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 32


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

On Friday we examined the short calendar spread as a position in the **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)). An illustrated three lot position sized at 4% risk of a model 20K portfolio was based falling implied volatilities and a move in the underlying instrument away from the at-the-money 113 strike. 

  

Using November and October calls, our forecast has proved correct but shown little in the way of actual profits despite the SPY moving from near 113 to north of 119 intraday and just two sessions later and at-the-money implieds dropping by about 17% from around 36% - 37% to the 30% - 31% area. 

  

So, what gives? Is the invisible hand pulling a slight of hand and interfering with what sounds like a win on the surface? Nope. Actually, the culprit responsible thus far has been a combination of implied volatility skew keeping the now protective out-of-money 113 strike mostly bid near prior levels and despite a solid percentage move in the SPY; the price action still falling short of collapsing the premium between the two contract months and what would amount to a profit for the short calendar. 

  

  

Admittedly, we could have done a better job of thinking about strike skew during this type of price move in the underlying, but it also serves as a good lesson. The truth is the pull of implieds versus movement in shares can be tricky business when dealing with both short and long calendars even though other vega risks related to earnings and FDA announcements and the likes are minimized when using a market barometer like the S&P500. That said, while some meager profits good for lunch money exist; the tip being left tonight is knowing when to call it a day and admit a forecasting error, rather than feeling obligated to stay the course in a position which doesn't appear fully suitable for today's market.

**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) stock is currently one of the top 10 yielding S&P 500 stocks, and so far this year the stock is outperforming the S&P 500.


XOM stock is trading just beneath its [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). But the stock is holding a nice cushion above the [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and 200-day moving averages.


The downside with the stock is that it is not highly rated on the IBD Checklist with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 7, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 8 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 36.


However, investors searching for yield can further enhance the yield on stocks such as XOM by using a covered call strategy.


When selling a covered call, the investor receives a premium and has an obligation to sell the shares at the strike price if called upon to do so.


One call option contract represents 100 shares, so investors can sell multiple call options if they have a particularly large stock holding.


XOM Stock Covered Call Can Provide Higher Returns
-------------------------------------------------


Over time, covered calls have the potential to increase returns while also decreasing the volatility of a portfolio.


On XOM stock, an April 47.50 call option can currently be sold for around $2.50 which would generate $250 in premium per contract and increase the annualized yield by 25%.



XOM currently pays around $3.48 in annual dividends, so generating another $2.50 from covered call writing in only three months is quite attractive.


The $2.50 in premium received also gives a small buffer on the downside of 5.33%. That means XOM stock could trade 5.33% lower between now and April 16 and the covered call trade would still break even.


The total capital at risk in the trade would be $4,350 and if XOM stock went to zero, that's how much the trade would lose.


Covered calls are a great way to generate extra income from a stock holding while also providing some downside protection.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) stock is showing high implied volatility with a reading of 54.65% compared with a 12-month low of 31.56% and a 12-month high of 61.43%. That gives shares an implied volatility percentile of 92% and an implied volatility rank of 77%.


High volatility can mean it's a great to time trade iron condors, because we can place our short strikes much further away from the market than we normally could.


So how to set up an iron condor on [United Airlines stock](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-united-airlines-ual.htm)? An [iron condor can be set up](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/come-prepared-for-sector-rotations-with-iron-condors-call-walls-and-more) via a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


First, take the [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/videos/come-prepared-for-sector-rotations-with-iron-condors-call-walls-and-more). Using the March 21 expiry, investors could sell the 82.50 put and buy the 77.50 put. That spread could be sold for around 70 cents.


Then the [bear call spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/nike-stock-today-trade-bear-call-spread-115-profit/) could be placed by selling the 110 call and buying the 115 call. This spread could be sold for around 55 cents.


Wide Profit Zone For Shares
---------------------------


In total the iron condor will generate around $125 in premiums. The profit zone ranges between 81.25 and 111.25. This can calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


This is quite a wide range for a stock like United Airlines. As both spreads are 5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 minus 1.25, then multiply that by 100. The result is $375.


Therefore, if we take the premium, $125, divided by the maximum risk of $375, this iron condor trade has the potential to return 33.3%. If price action stabilizes then iron condors will work well. However, if United Airlines stock makes a big move the trade will suffer losses.


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $125, so could set a stop equal to the premium of $125. Note that United Airlines reported earnings in mid-January, so this trade should no have earnings risk.


How United Airlines Stock Ranks
-------------------------------


According to Investor's Business Daily's [IBD Stock Checkup](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-watch-ibd-screen-of-the-day/), United Airlines ranks fifth in its group and has a Composite Rating of 91. Further, its Earnings Per Share Rating is 47 and its Relative Strength Rating stands at 97.


The last iron condor we looked at for was **Taiwan Semiconductor** ([TSM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)), which expired worthless last week for a full profit. **Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) moved higher yesterday, so if you were considering this bear call spread, you might want to move the strikes up to 85-90.

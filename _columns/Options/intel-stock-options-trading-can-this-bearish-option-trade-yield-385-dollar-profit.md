On Nov. 9, we [looked at an option trade called a cash-secured put](https://www.investors.com/research/options/intel-stock-options-buy-at-discount/) on **Intel** ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)). At the time, the megacap tech stock was the most oversold stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the idea was to sell a Jan. 15-expiring 43 strike put for around $1.70.




That [put option](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) traded Wednesday for around $1.10 (earlier in the week it traded as low as 70 cents), so one could have bought it back for a profit of around 60 cents.


That might not sound like much. But that 1.45% return in 10 days equates to around 53% on an annualized basis.


An option contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell a stock within a set time period. One contract is worth 100 shares. One put option worth $0.60 would cost $60 to buy it ($0.60 times 100 shares per option contract).


With the chart of Intel stock looking quite bearish, I would close the cash-secured put and use the profits to open a new bearish option trade called a bear put spread. A bear put spread, a defined-risk option strategy, involves buying a put and then selling a further out-of-the-money put.


Bearish Intel Stock Option Trade
--------------------------------



To create this bearish trade, look to buy the Dec. 18-expiring 45 strike put and sell the Dec. 18 40 strike put.


The spread was recently trading for around $1.15. This means a trader selling this spread would pay $115 in option premium and would have a maximum potential return of $385.


The most the trade can lose is $115. This would occur if Intel stock finishes above 45 at expiry. However, remember we're also booking profits of around $60 from the cash-secured put, so the maximum risk across the two trades is effectively only $55.


Weak IBD Ratings
----------------


[According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Intel has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 33, an 86 [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/), and an RS Rating of just 9, making the stock a good candidate for a bearish option trade.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

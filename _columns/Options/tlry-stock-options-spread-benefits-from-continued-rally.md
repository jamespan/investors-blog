**Tilray** ([TLRY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLRY)) stock was the talk of the town yesterday with a 17% rally for the day. Option volume was slightly above normal, but 83% of the contracts traded were call options.


That's generally a bullish sign as we saw recently with **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **Rocket** ([RKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RKT)) and **Ford** ([F](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)).


TLRY stock is one of the most high profile pot stocks. It recently held above its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) during its latest pullback.


Traders who think TLRY stock might get back to the high set in February around 65 could look at an out-of-the-money bull call spread.


A low risk, high reward trade would be to buy the June 18 call spread with the long call at 60 and the short call at 65.


As of yesterday, the 60 June call was trading around $4.95 and the 65 call was around $4.60.


Buying that spread would cost around 35 cents per spread or $35 in total.


TLRY Stock High Return Spread
-----------------------------


The maximum profit potential would be $465 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy. So if TLRY stock closes below 60 on June 18, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $35 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 65. No matter how high TLRY stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $465.


This is a bit of a lottery trade as TLRY stock would need to experience a large gain for the trade to be profitable. But this is a low-risk way to play a potential rally in this popular pot stock.


Tilray stock is currently showing a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 84, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 59 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 98.


Earnings for the stock are set for May 19, so this trade would have earnings risk.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

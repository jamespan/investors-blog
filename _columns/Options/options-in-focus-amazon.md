Stocks bounced back forcefully Monday in the final 90 minutes or so of trade following more than a bit of unwanted intraday volatility and early bearish headline overtures out of Europe. One leading large cap though, which stayed mostly above water all session and continues to please technically is **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). 

  

Shares of AMZN finished up about 2.2% and held a second test of 50-day simple moving average support within the last two weeks. The action appears to be in the process of setting up a handle consolidation within its first-stage cup-shaped base. 

  

For their part, option traders appeared mostly ambivalent Monday as mostly average contract volume of about 52,000 and a neutral run-of-the-mill put/call of 1.10 attest too. Most active on the session, the at-the-money September 215 calls saw volume of 4,600. 

  

The activity bested open interest of 3,900 but is ultimately made less impressive as expiration is just four days out. In the end, it's likely a good deal of today's action was simply closing down positions, for better or worse, rather than making a more bold statement with fresh monies being heavily involved. 

  

Looking out to October, the largest action centered on the October 220 put. With 2,100 contracts trading and open interest of just 1,300 it appears some opening of positions was certainly involved which may or may not be part of a roll out from a September contract. 

  

Whether the paper in October represents put sellers versus buyers of premium is another question mark in my eyes. October of course is known for its bearish inclinations and implied volatility has been good to own of late. On the other hand, premiums are priced richly enough to reflect the current condition and maintain that "Ouch!" factor if the market settles down. 

  

With the October contract falling outside of Amazon's earnings cycle and shares of AMZN handling things so well today, I think the action favors put sellers. That said, I don't see it as so strong as to ignore targeting a purchase like another put, rather than confidently dreaming of owning shares below the market.

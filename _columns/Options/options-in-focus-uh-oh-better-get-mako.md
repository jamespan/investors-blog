If you're of a certain age, it's likely you've heard the jingle "Uh Oh! Better Get Maaco" for collision repair specialist Maaco. More recently and if you're an investor, Tuesday's warning-related fallout from surgical systems manufacturer **Mako** ([MAKO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MAKO)) saw shares bloodied by 43%.

  

While investors should take care not to confuse the two, if you think this is one accident worth fixing, selling a put vertical is an option strategy worth thinking about versus simply buying stock. 

  

A bull put vertical, which sells a higher strike put while purchasing a lower strike put in the same contract month allows a bullish trader to potentially collect premium with limited downside risk. 

  

At the same time and like the riskier "targeted purchase" strategy, which only sells a put, the trader can still pick up shares at a discount to current market prices if he or she wishes to follow through with the assignment process and accept long stock at the sold strike with no offsetting adjustment.

  

Checking the option board, with shares trading near $14.55, two viable candidates are the August 15 / 12.5 put spread and August 12.5 / 10 put spread. The latter out-of-the-money vertical is changing hands for $.40 mid-market, maintains risk of $2.10 below $10 at expiration and sports a breakeven of $12.10. 

  

The slightly in-the-money 15 / 12.5 vertical trades for $1.00. In turn, the position has a breakeven of $14.00 and risk of $1.50 per spread if shares are below 12.5 at expiration. 

  

Which is better? That depends on the individual trader's outlook on shares as much as anything. The 15 / 12.5 has 2.5 times the potential reward if shares can rally, but can also take in $0.55 of premium versus $0.40 if MAKO finds itself at current levels at expiration. 

  

On the other hand, shares need only fall 4% and this same vertical is breaking even and then underwater. At the same time, the out-of-the-money vertical has a much more sizable downside cushion of about 17% before any expiration-related assignments find this modified target purchase showing a less advantageous long stock entry. Either way, if you're going to get into MAKO, you might want to think about getting a vertical.

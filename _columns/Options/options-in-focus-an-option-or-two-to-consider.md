Unlike stocks, trading options involve more than simply being a bull or bear. For starters, there are important Greeks other than delta (direction), which are embedded in all calls and puts. At a minimum, to be a more well-informed directional strategist, a trader should know the potential impact of variables such as time decay (theta), implied (vega) and statistical volatility, dividends and possibly interest rates (rho), depending on one's time frame or commitment to the position.

  

There's also liquidity to consider when dealing with options. Less than desirable conditions require extra thought as to whether a spread or outright for that matter, is even worth entering into when prices theoretically look promising. Bearing all the fore-mentioned variables in mind will ultimately put option traders well on their way to deciding upon a stronger built position than otherwise possible.

  

It's true, options might not be traditional stuff by some standards as they are a derivative bet with a limited contract life. Yet, given options can act just like stock, control risk in ways that buying or shorting shares simply can't guarantee, as well as allow for other types of exposure if wanted; educating oneself to those possibilities seems a smart move for investors. 

  

After rolling up your sleeves and understanding how a spread such as a vertical would react to a volatility crush or what a time spread post earnings might look like, you may still find options won't be your primary investment vehicle. However, to suggest calls and puts don't have a place amongst proper buy points, square-box patterns, high level double bottoms and the likes just seems a bit silly given the competitive nature of ever sophisticated markets.

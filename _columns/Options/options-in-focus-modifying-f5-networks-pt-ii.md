Thursday afternoon we discussed the not-to-be-overlooked limited-risk characteristics afforded by more than a few option strategies. The earnings-related fallout of **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) served as our purposeful reminder. For investors still willing to see F5 optimistically, we went on to illustrate a bullish vertical strategy in FFIV's very Mad Money “FADSCAN” imploding aftermath.

  

Looking to side with a handful of optimistic upgrades and reiterations from the likes of Credit Suisse, Gleacher and Wedbush while also appreciating FFIV’s likely overhead resistance, we chose a February 105 / 115 bull call on two contracts. While the spread offered an effective stop loss of $4 per contract we stated our idea would be to adjust quickly into the likes of a long call condor or some type of long butterfly given a bounce of 3% to 5% in FFIV.

  

Lo’ and behold and likely aided by Friday’s upbeat, out-the-gate market climate FFIV secured intraday gains of 4% thereabouts. Looking at the option board around that time and I liked the fit of mixing and matching for the time being.

  

  

By adding one February 120 / 130 bear vertical, rather than executing two and what would amount to a straightforward all call long condor; the trader maintains some ammo to make an even stronger spread sale if shares were to continue towards what we see as fairly stiff resistance in the 120 to 125 area.

  

Less premium is taken in with this adjustment of course. However, we have begun the process of reducing our max defined risk by about 25% with the total risk now $3 per spread versus the $4.00 bull vertical initiation price. Also, unlike with executing two spreads at this point in time, this trader does maintain profits on the upside, if shares were to somehow, however unlikely, move strongly higher over the next month.

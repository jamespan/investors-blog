The IBD 50 is seeing roughly 25% of its component stocks experience above-average call and put activity to kick off the week. Topping off the list, **American Tower Corp** ([AMT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMT)) is seeing a six-fold surge in its contract count on overall volume of 4,200 compared to its daily average of 600. 

  

Puts are favored by a whopping 11-to-1 margin and about 50% of the volume is tied to just two trades. In the June front month, an out-the-money vertical, likely closing, was put up for even money 750 times. 

  

As June expires this Friday, open interest is only slightly larger than today's volume and the trade was put up for no cost to the buyer of the bear vertical, all evidence points at a closing, sweetheart deal, but one of little use as to where traders see shares moving in the days and weeks ahead. 

  

One spot where traders could be telegraphing fresh directional signals with new positions is the July contract. Roughly 2,000 contracts have traded in total. A couple prints in the July 62.15 and 57.15 strikes totaling 380 contracts in each strike looks to be an opening vertical based on lesser existing open interest. The five point directional spread was put up over a handful of $0.40 and $0.45 prints and maintains a breakeven of about 7% below AMT's current share price near 66.15. 

  

Intraday, the spread cost half of the outright 62.15 put. Speaking of which, that put was also popular with one larger trader who put up a block of 458 contracts at $0.77. Also catching our attention, about 500 unrelated July 64.65 puts traded in smaller prints throughout the session. For those interested in knowing whether buyers or sellers of puts were in control of the order flow, it's not going to be an easy task, if at all possible without having carnal knowledge of today's activity. 

  

In our opinion, mixed signals of modest pressure on implieds but relatively high statistical volatility and premiums mostly matching those levels, means estimating targeted buyers from targeted sellers or short put versus long put strategies; is more difficult than usual. The good news, well at least how we see it, traders can now go about the business, should they so choose, of looking at positioning which makes sense and cents to themselves, without needing to worry about what the other trader may or may not be doing.

Inside of the IBD 50, shares of No. 47-ranked **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)) saw its option volume swell to 16,500 contracts and more than 1,000% above its 50-day simple moving average of 1,400 on Tuesday. Heading into the final minutes of the trading day, puts are finding favor by a 1.25-to-1.0 margin as shares trade higher by 0.62% out of a base-on-base pattern to a fresh all time-high. 

  

Given the technical picture, what's to explain the incongruity with today's put action? Well, given a rather unusual bid in implieds as premiums continue to collapse in the broader market for a second session and with earnings set for Wednesday evening; it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make the call that traders are net buyers of protection and trying to guard against the proverbial bath in shares or attempting to capitalize on that sort of move.

  

With June Weeklys on the board and set to expire this Friday, that contract is as close to a pure earnings play as available, though obviously still at the potential mercy of the Fed and overseas credit markets. The "at" and slightly out-of-the-money 75 and 72.5 put are finding decent, but far from spectacular interest as implieds continued to lift into the low 80s. 

  

Compared to statistical readings for shares of BBBY in the low to mid-20s, a post earnings crush is all but written in stone. That said, the crux of profitability for a short premium play on volatility will be largely determined by the ensuing investor reaction in shares and how that might counter or assist with the existing benefits of lower implieds and decent theta collection. 

  

In the end, a large enough price gap or fast and potentially hostile and volatile swings in the underlying on Thursday are the nemesis of positioning with either short puts, short calls or some combo of the two such as a short straddle or strangle. The latter are stricter plays on volatility versus the two-standalone short contract plays. 

  

The other side of such positions is of course looking for price movement in the underlying to counter the impact of being long theta and long vega. For instance, a long call buyer desires a large upside move. Right now and eyeballing the almost at-the-money June Weeklys 75 call for $1.85; the immediate risk were shares to open flat on Thursday would be a quick forfeiture of $1.00 to $1.10 based on a conservative 50% to 60% drop in implieds and theta of $0.34 per day. 

  

Time will quickly tell which side is positioning correctly for this earnings event if the trader is using the June Weeklys. At the same time, for those traders going further out on the board, such as today's largest trade, a 2,500 July 75 straddle for $5.52; they have the opportunity, should they so choose, of allowing time and price to benefit their position. However, seeing how that logic stands to potentially help both sides, the only thing we know with real authority is given July's more normalized pricing, the immediate combined impact of a volatility crush and theta are a smaller risk, as are the potential rewards, but not when you're dealing with whale-sized positioning like today's trader.

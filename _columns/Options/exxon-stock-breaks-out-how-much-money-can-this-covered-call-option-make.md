**Exxon Mobil** ([XOM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XOM)) stock is one of the top yielding stocks in the S&P 500. According to [MarketSmith](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF), the blue chip shows an annualized dividend yield of 5.4%. And now Exxon is breaking out past resistance near 64.




In effect, XOM stock is clearing a [five-week flat base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-buy-the-basics-of-a-flat-base-a-super-growth-stock-pattern/) that shows a 64.12 [correct buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/). XOM stock is also trading above its rising [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), as well as its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.


The [5% buy zone](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/buy-zone-nvidia-stock/) goes up to 67.33.


The downside with XOM stock is that it is not highly rated on the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 58, an EPS Rating of 30 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 80.


However, investors searching for yield can further enhance the yield on stocks such as XOM by using a covered call strategy.


Why Sell A Covered Call In Exxon Stock
--------------------------------------



When selling a covered call, the investor receives a premium and has an obligation to sell the shares at the strike price if called upon to do so.


One call option contract represents 100 shares. So, investors can sell multiple call options if they have a particularly large stock holding.


Over time, covered calls have the potential to increase returns while also reducing the volatility of a portfolio.


Setting Up The Trade In XOM Stock
---------------------------------



On XOM stock, an Aug. 20-expiring call option with a 67.50 strike price can currently be sold for around $1.65 per contract. This would generate $165 in premium per contract and increase the annualized yield by 14%.


XOM currently pays around $3.48 per share in annual dividends, so generating another $1.65 from covered call writing in only two months is quite attractive.


The $1.65 in premium received also gives a small buffer on the downside of roughly 2.6%. That means Exxon stock could trade 2.6% lower between now and Aug. 20 and the covered call trade would still break even.


Option Risk
-----------


The total capital at risk in the trade would be $6,284. If XOM stock went to zero, that's how much the trade would lose.


Covered calls are a fantastic way to generate extra income from a stock holding while also providing some downside protection.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


Remember options are risky. Investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Closing out an option position the old fashioned way in the open market might sound like anything but neglectful. Sometimes though, there are savvier alternatives. In the following we'll explore a couple simple but potentially more elegant ways to close down risk, which at times can make a good deal more "sense and cents" around expiration.

  

To begin, let's say a trader initially purchased an ATM August 70 call for $2.10 in growth juggernaut XYZ Corp. as shares cleared a 71.50 buy point with about three to four weeks left in the contract. A couple of weeks later, with expiration fast approaching and what proved to be a timely buy, the trader realizes he or she would like to book profits with the stock at $76. Intrinsically, the call is worth $6 per contract after producing a near double in profit. However, when the trader goes to close out the position by offering the call at $6.00, they notice the market is quoted as $5.70 bid / $6.00 ask. 

  

The trader might see the above quote and think "good enough for government work", hit the bid of $5.70 and call it a day with $3.60 in profits. In certain instances the trader might be right for taking that kind of action. The most compelling reason is in highly volatile markets it might not be worth squabbling over a few pennies or even a quarter as you could quickly find yourself giving back a good deal more. But, if the trader executes without looking at other options, pardon the pun; over the long run they could be costing themselves real and sometimes, even much larger profits. 

  

One exiting strategy worth remembering is to utilize a 'same day exercise' for the long 70 call position and sell XYZ shares at the current price of $76, if the liquidity provision in the stock allows for this action. Effectively, this process lets the trader pocket an extra $0.30 versus the discussed and traditional "sell to close" exit for $5.70 on the bid. This method even tops a sale of $5.80 to $5.90 in the call, if he or she felt splitting the current call market was feasible.

  

If this process is allowable with your broker, make sure the commission bill is less than the amount saved. As expressed, liquidity in the underlying is also a key factor. If the trader can't realistically sell the stock for better than 75.90 thereabouts, the "good enough" option of selling the contract itself would likely make prudent sense at that point.

  

The other possibility, if the trading account "can cover" such a position and stock liquidity is available, is to short shares near 76. This action converts the position into a synthetic long put through expiration. In this scenario, we can guess the equivalent well-out-of-money 70 put market is a "rip up" i.e. "no bid and offered" situation when this strategy is considered. However, with corrections in the market popping up from time to time, you never know if the "rip up" might turn into something of extreme value in short order.

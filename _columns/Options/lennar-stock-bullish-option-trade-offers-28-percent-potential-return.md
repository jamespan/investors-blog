Homebuilder stocks continue to rise and Lennar stock is among the leaders. A bull put spread option trade could capture a nice return should it continue pushing to new highs.




Bull Put Spread On Lennar Stock
-------------------------------


**Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)) currently has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 92, an EPS Rating of 96 and an RS Rating of 87. According to [IBD's Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-lennar-corp-cl-a-len.aspx), that puts LEN stock just above the middle of the homebuilders group. Homebuilders got another boost today with [**LGI Homes** (](https://www.investors.com/news/lgi-homes-earnings-q2-2020-topbuild-earnings/)[LGIH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LGIH)) topping estimates in its latest earnings report.


LEN stock hit a high of 74.32 last week and looks like it may test that level again this week. I would be bullish while it is above a rising [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


Option traders looking for bullish exposure on LEN stock could look at a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined-risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor sells an out-of-the-money put (the short put) and then buys a further out-of-the-money put (the long put).


For the bull put spread on Lennar stock, one could sell a 67.50 put and buy a 62.50 put, both with an expiration of Sept. 18.


As of yesterday, this spread traded around 1.10. That gives the option trader selling this spread $110 in option premium, also the maximum profit. The maximum risk is the difference between the strike prices less the option premium received, or $390. In roughly six weeks, the maximum profit gives a 28.2% potential return.


Risk Vs. Reward
---------------


As long as Lennar stock remains above 67.50 on the Sept. 18 expiration, the option trader keeps the entire premium for max profit.


However, if Lennar stock closes below 62.50 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $390. Should that happen, Lennar stock would be well below its 50-day moving average line.



But there's no need to wait to take the full loss. Setting a stop loss if LEN stock breaks below the 21-day moving average would make sense.


Lennar is due to release its Q2 earnings numbers around Sept. 14, which could cause a big move in the stock.


This is where an options spread has an advantage over uncovered strategies. With a bull put spread, you always know the worst-case scenario even if Lennar stock tanks.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

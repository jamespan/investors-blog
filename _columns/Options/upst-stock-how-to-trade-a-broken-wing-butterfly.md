UPST stock is currently one of the most impressive stocks in the market.




**Upstart** ([UPST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UPST)) is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Consumer Loans industry group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 65, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99.


Such a strong stock may not pull back very far and could possibly drift sideways or continue grinding higher.


Using options, we can create a strategy that has zero risk on the downside and a large profit zone between 310 and 350.


The catch is that there is risk on the upside if UPST stock makes a big move higher. So, this is a neutral to slightly bullish trade. Very bullish traders would not enter this trade.


UPST Stock: Broken Wing Butterfly
---------------------------------


The strategy is called a broken wing butterfly. Let's take a look:


Buy 1 October 15, 310 call @ 14.80


Sell 2 October 15, 330 call @ 10.45


Buy 1 October 15, 370 call @ 5.20


Notice that the lower strike call is 20 points away from the middle call, and the upper call is 40 points away.



This broken wing butterfly trade will generate $90 in premium. If UPST stock ends below 310, all the calls expire worthless, and the trader keeps the $90 premium paid.


On the upside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the width between the first two strikes (20) multiplied by 100 and subtracting the premium received (90).


That gives us 20 x 100 - 90 = $1,910


Maximum Gain
------------


The maximum gain can be calculated as 20 x 100 + 90 = $2,090, although this would only be achieved if UPST expired right at 330.


The ideal scenario for the trade is that UPST stock stays below 330 until expiration.

The risk on the trade is that UPST stock shoots significantly higher, particularly early in the trade.


A broken wing butterfly could be a nice way to trade UPST stock for those with a neutral to slightly bullish outlook.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss if UPST broke above 340.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

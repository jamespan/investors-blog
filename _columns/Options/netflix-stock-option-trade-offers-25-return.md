**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stock is currently ranked No. 1 in the movies and related companies industry group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 89. 




Netflix is also one of the [most popular stocks with millennials](https://www.investors.com/news/millennial-investing-stocks-etfs-personal-finance-student-loans/). 


With a three-year EPS growth rate of 67% and a three-year sales growth rate of 25%, Netflix is an ideal candidate for a bullish option trade. 


When looking at bull put spreads, we normally keep our days to expiration around 30 to 60. However, today we're going to look at a much longer-term example. 


Longer-term trades have a lower annualized return, but they also move a bit slower and require less active management. 


As a reminder, to execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. 


Let's go out to June next year and look at selling the 545-strike price put and buying the 540 put. 


25% Return On Risk With Bull Put Spread
---------------------------------------


This spread was trading Wednesday for around $1. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $100 in option premium for a block of 100 shares and would have a maximum risk of $400. 


That represents a 25% return on risk between now and June if Netflix stock remains above 545. 


If NFLX closes below 540 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $400. 


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 544. That's calculated as 545 less the $1 option premium per contract. The break-even price is 21.35% below Wednesday's closing price. 


Trade Equivalent To Owning 1 Share Of Netflix
---------------------------------------------


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 1, which means it is a similar exposure to owning one share of Netflix stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves. Long term put spreads like this will be much less sensitive to changes in the stock price. 



In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1 to $2, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


With such a long time to expiration, there will be two earnings news releases that this trade would be exposed to if held to expiry. 


Today, Netflix stock is extended from its latest [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/), trading near record highs.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

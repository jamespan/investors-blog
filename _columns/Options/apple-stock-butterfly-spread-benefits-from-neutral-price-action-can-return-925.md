A butterfly is a neutral, income-oriented strategy. It is a limited risk and limited profit trade, but on a typical butterfly trade, the profit potential is higher than the potential loss.




Butterfly spreads involve three different option strike prices, all within the same expiration date. They can be created using either calls or puts.


A typical butterfly would be constructed as follows:


* Buy 1 in-the-money call
* Sell 2 at-the-money calls
* Buy 1 out-of-the-money call


Today, we will look at an example on **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) stock:


* Buy 1 July 21, 160 call @ 18.05
* Sell 2 July 21, 175 calls @ 6.60
* Buy 1 July 21, 190 call @ 0.90


The total cost of this trade was $575 using quotes from late Friday. And that is the maximum loss potential on the trade.


Maximum Gain on Apple Stock Trade $925
--------------------------------------


The maximum gain is $925, which is calculated by taking the difference in strike prices less the premium paid ($1,500 less $575).



The break-even prices are 165.75 and 184.25 (the lower strike plus the premium, and upper strike minus the premium).


A butterfly options trade, has a tentlike shape with the potential for very large profits around the short strike. It's important to keep in mind that it's unlikely you would ever achieve the maximum profit.


A good aim for a butterfly trade is to make a 20% return on capital at risk. In this case that would be around $115.

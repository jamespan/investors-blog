Once traders become familiar with [vertical spreads](https://www.investors.com/research/options/dbx-stock-analyzing-bullish-option-trade/), the next natural progression is to move on to iron condors.




So, what is an iron condor?


This direction-neutral trade results in the combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. (Please see this story on how a [bear call spread in JPMorgan Chase](https://www.investors.com/research/options/jpmorgan-stock-option-could-net-25-gain-in-four-weeks/) ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) got recently created.)


Over the course of any trade, a stock can move one of five ways:


* Up a lot
* Up a little
* Sideways
* Down a little
* Down a lot


Stock investors would make money in the first two of the above five scenarios. Iron condors will make money in the middle 3 situations and with certain stocks and indexes, that can happen a lot.


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock won't move too much in either direction.


If we use **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) stock as an example, let's look at how to set up a typical iron condor trade. First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Oct. 16 expiry, we could sell the 430 put option and buy the 420 put. That spread can be sold for around $1.40.



Then you have the bear call spread. You could place it by selling the 520 call and buying the 530 call. This spread can be sold for around $1.60.


In total the iron condor will generate around $3 in premium per option contract, or $300 ($3 times 100 shares commanded by each call option).


Adobe Stock: How This Trade Generates Gains
-------------------------------------------


The profit zone is if Adobe stock stays between 427 and 523. This is calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


As both spreads are $10 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is $700, or $1,000 minus the $300 in total premium received.Â Therefore, if we take the premium divided by the maximum risk, this iron condor trade has the potential to return 42.9%.


That's a very nice return. It would be great if things were as easy as that.


However, iron condors generally need some management as the trade progresses and the stock starts to move in either direction. That takes a bit of skill and experience, so this isn't a strategy for beginners. But they offer a fantastic strategy once you get the hang of them. Just make sure to paper trade for a few months before risking live capital.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Once traders become familiar with vertical spreads, the next natural progression is to move on to iron condors. Here's how you could set up an iron condor for Apple stock.




What Is An Iron Condor In Options Trading?
------------------------------------------


An iron condor is a neutral trade that is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. As always, the success of the trade depends on how the stock moves. Over the course of any trade, a stock can move one of five ways:


* Up a lot
* Up a little
* Sideways
* Down a little
* Down a lot


Let's take **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) as an example. Investors in Apple stock make money in the first two of the above five scenarios. But iron condors make money in the middle three situations. With certain stocks and indexes, those scenarios can happen a lot.


The idea behind this option trade is to profit from time decay. The expectation is that the stock won't move too much in either direction.

----------------------------------------


So how do we set up an iron condor option trade for Apple stock?


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the July 17 expiration, we could sell the 290 put and buy the 280 put. That spread can be sold for around $1. Then, you add the bear call spread with the same expiration. Selling the 350 call and buying the 360 call would work for that leg. This spread can be sold for around $1.10. That generates around $2.10 in premium in total for this iron condor option trade.

Risks And Returns
-----------------


The profit zone for the trade is if Apple stock stays between 277.90 and 352.10. This is calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


The maximum risk takes the spread between the strikes and subtracts the premium received. As both spreads are $10 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is (10 â€” 2.10) x 100 = $790.


Taking the profit potential divided by the maximum risk gives you a potential return of 26.6% for the iron condor on Apple stock. That's if the stock doesn't really go anywhere.

However, iron condors generally need some management as the trade progresses and the stock starts to move in either direction. That takes a bit of skill and experience, so this isn't a strategy for beginners. But it's a fantastic strategy once you get the hang of it.

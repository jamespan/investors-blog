Could investors have foreseen Monday's anxious rekindling of credit market fears and global economic despair coming? This market analyst thinks the answer deserves a strong "maybe" and one which might be respected the next time investors become a bit too fearful in their optimism, of missing out on further upside. 

  

The specifics of course of European Union leaders and Italy's troubled ways being the catalyst behind Monday's bearish market pressure are difficult at best, if not impossible, to predict with any authority. But, for those willing to look at some rather bulled up sentiment in the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" late last week, today's reaction to the unexpected looks a whole lot more like history repeating itself. 

  

Last Thursday investors collectively signaled a second round of overconfident behavior in a week's time by sending the VIX more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average. As a mean-reverting instrument and contrary indicator that type of stretch or difference between the two, isn't to be taken lightly. 

  

Friday's shaking off a bearish jobs report wasn't much better. The VIX was up on the session, but its rise of less than two percent to just above 16% and still 6% below its fore-mentioned moving average; was less than impressive or expressive of any fear or risk being seen in the market by investors...other than (as mentioned) of missing out. 

  

In of itself, the VIX's all-too-confident price action suggested a high probability of a short-term pullback as forthcoming or that traders should at least have expected a good pause of a couple days or more in order to work off the broader market's overbought condition.

  

In conjunction with prices in the VIX also much closer to nominally cheap historic levels and near multi-year lows, that bit of unconventional but truthful market pulse-taking, has, and contrary to the headlines, made sense and cents of some less-than-surprising Monday market mayhem.

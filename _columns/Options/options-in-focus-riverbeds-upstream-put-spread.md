With a couple hours left in Tuesday’s session, **Riverbed Technology** ([RVBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVBD)) is seeing its shares rise by more than 6.0%. Imbuing bulls in front of its After Hours earnings release are the likely technical duo of a double-bottom shaped base four-plus months in the making and improved price action in the broader market, which has put all the major averages back above their 50-day simple moving averages.  
  
On the option side, trading is fairly heavy but not entirely out of the ordinary in lieu of tonight’s report. What might be surprising is the favor being found in Riverbed’s puts. Activity in those options is currently outpacing the calls by nearly 6-to-1. Seeing the most concentrated trading are the now "At" and out-of-the-money August 41 and 40 puts on volume of 1,500 and 3,000 respectively.   
  
Implieds are in the high 50s and prone to a volatility crush as premiums are at the cusp of three-month range highs and above the stock’s historic or statistical volatility range of 30% to 50%. Taken together, we’d guesstimate implieds will trade in the low 40s to 45% tomorrow, which would amount to a drop of about 25% to 30%.   
  
As much, outright protection or bearish speculations using either of the fore-mentioned puts does come at a cost as both enter the theta sensitive final 30 calendar days until expiration and maintain volatility risk for buyers. 

  

One strategy for bulls willing to "handle" things differently and which utilizes today’s two-to-one volume ratio is a front-spread strategy, which buys the 41 put and simultaneously sells two of the 40 puts. With implieds as they are, this position takes in a credit of $1.55 with shares at $41.20.

  

As a net seller of puts, there is downside risk involved but the trader’s breakeven is $37.45 and roughly 2% below the recent handle lows established last week. For bulls that wish to deploy a "targeted purchase" type strategy and potentially receive assignment below current market prices, this is one such variation of that type of play. If shares remain above 41 come expiration, the trader would be in position to pocket in full, the credit of $1.55.   
  
Personally, we always like the idea of having a protective out i.e. long put, at a lower strike to form a modified butterfly, even if it seems ridiculously away from the action and any imaginable reality for the stock come tomorrow. In the end, while the credit is reduced by the cost of the purchased premium, it does guarantee an absolute technical line in the sand other than a stock price of zero and even reduces margin requirements so traders are free to handle other positions with a bit more confidence.

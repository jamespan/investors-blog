**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) stock has been one of the weaker large-caps in the market recently. On the latest rally attempt, it couldn't even reach the declining 50-day moving average.




I'm willing to look at an option trade that will profit if Disney stock comes back down toward 85 in the next month.


The trade is a directional butterfly, centered at 85 with the view that Disney might retrace to that level.


A butterfly is a limited risk and limited profit trade. But on a typical butterfly trade, the profit potential is higher than the potential loss. In this case, it's a lot higher.


Placing the trade out-of-the-money means it can be done for a low cost with a high profit potential.


Butterfly spreads involve three different option strike prices, all with the same expiration date. They can be created using either calls or puts.


Setting Up Butterfly Spread
---------------------------


Because we are placing the butterfly below the market, we will use puts in this case to reduce the risk of early assignment.


Here's the trade I'm looking at:


* Buy 1 July 21, 75-strike put at 0.10
* Sell 2 July 21, 85-strike puts at 0.55
* Buy 1 July 21, 95-strike put at 3.90


The total cost of this trade is $290, and that is the maximum loss potential on the trade.


The maximum gain is $710. That's calculated by taking the difference in strike prices less the premium paid ($1,000 less $390).


If Disney doesn't get down to 85, I lose a little bit. But I have the potential for a large payoff if it does hit 85 in mid-July.


Trade On Disney Stock Could Lose $290
-------------------------------------


For a trade like this, it either works or it doesn't, and I'm prepared to lose the whole $290 if it doesn't work out.

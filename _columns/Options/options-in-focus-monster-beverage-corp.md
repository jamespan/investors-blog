With less than an hour to go, **Monster Beverage Corp** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) is under stiff pressure of around 12%. The company disclosed last night a subpoena by the attorney general in connection with an investigation into its advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of its popular branded Monster Energy drink. 

  

The action hasn't gone unnoticed by option traders as volume has swelled nearly nine-fold to 44,000 contracts. Spiking implieds and put contracts being the flavor of the day by a 1.3-to-1 margin suggests traders anticipate continued volatility in shares of MNST. ATM implieds in the August contract are pricing in a one standard deviation or 68% chance shares could see a move up or down of around 8.5% through next Friday based on today's shift in implieds to 62% from 38% last night. 

  

Looking out into Monster's September options, implieds have risen by about 10 points from 39% to almost 49%. While the increase is smaller in absolute terms, vega or volatility risk per point for those call and put contracts is substantially larger at $0.07 versus August's $0.03. That said, the pricing also reflects a larger percentage move of more than 16.5% in shares during the next 42 calendar days until September comes off the board.

  

  

Last night's subpoena news follows Wednesday night's disappointing earnings miss. The combined price action has shares off about 21% for the two-day period, hitting five-plus month lows and now in bear territory below the 200-day simple moving average for the first time in a couple years. One idea for bearish traders wanting to greatly reduce volatility risk and keep any potential losses limited is the bear vertical.

  

With Monster's options fairly liquid, traders have more than a few both bear call and bear put verticals to consider ranging from spreads constructed as tight as 2.5 points, 5 points and even as wide as 7.5 points while still greatly reducing vega risk. Shown above is a -5x September 60 / 62.5 bear call spread. For a $0.50 credit, the spread can collect the full credit if at expiration shares remain below 60. Currently that buffer means the trader can have shares move about 10% higher and still take in the maximum profit. 

  

Risk of $2.00 is the difference between strikes minus the credit. That amount would be realized if shares of MNST are above 62.5 at expiration or earlier, if by chance, past bubbly buzz of Monster being an acquisition target, was to reintroduce itself. And while losses are never fun, being able to keep them small and manageable in the face of what would amount to being a monster move, makes the vertical a sensible strategy.

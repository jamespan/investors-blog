The CBOE Volatility Index rallied about about 7% with an hour left in Tuesday's session 7%. But despite the bid, investor sentiment remains much more sympathetic to the fear of missing out than one of panic. And that continues to be a potential issue for the broader market's ability to move higher. 

  

So, what's the problem you ask? The big concern rests with Monday's treatment of risk by investors. Yesterday's final hour of trade saw the euphemistically called fear fauge dip into a full test of its March lows of 13.66% and down 7% on the day. At the same time and more pressing, the confident pressure challenged the VIX's multiyear lows while extending the instrument a full 15% below its mean-reverting, short-term 10-day simple moving average.

  

Typically used as a contrary indicator, differentials between the VIX and its short-term moving average of 15% or more are prone to recalibrating back towards the recent norm, which we define with the 10-day simple moving average. When a signal triggers and daily or weekly levels of absolute price importance are also involved, as was the case on Monday, a flag is raised. This net action hints strongly at investor confidence becoming too complacent as protective strategies like buying puts to protect a long stock portfolio have been replaced by income generation objectives with much greater risk such as buy-writes or the selling of puts.

  

So, what's next you ask? We don't maintain the rights to a crystal ball. But history does suggest lower odds for a sustainable upside move in the broader market until the VIX might, at a minimum, test its 10-day simple moving average. Until that day comes, there's the increased likelihood of lower market prices or more of this past week's aggravating mostly lateral chop, which looks to technically torment both bulls and bears. As much and if you've managed to ride some of the broader market's uptrend to open profits in the portfolio, you may want to consider protecting those gains with protection made more affordable than usual, relatively speaking and otherwise.

One of the great characteristics of trading options rather than simply holding stock is how a trader can profit where none would be possible with stock. One strategy, which can take advantage of this feature is the in-the-money bull call vertical. 

  

The in-the-money bull call vertical, as with any call vertical, is comprised of a lower purchased strike call and a sold or shorted higher strike call. This selection of strikes in relation to shares allows the trader to profit if shares wind up sitting rather than going up. 

  

The reason a profit is possible versus a loss for an "at" or out-of-the money vertical is due to the sold call's larger extrinsic premium relative to the deeper purchased strike. While that call will be worth more in dollar terms, its extrinsic or time value will always be smaller. This relationship means the shorted call's time decay will be greater than what's lost (if any) on the long call tied to extrinsic premium.

  

At the end of the day or more correctly, at expiration, this type spread will expand in value to the distance between the two calls if shares are above both strikes. All extrinsic value will have been removed from each contract's price, which will be comprised entirely of intrinsic value as the option becomes a stock equivalent and typically converted into actual shares. 

  

The profit at that point in time would simply be the difference in strikes minus the initial purchase price. For example if the venerable XYZ Corp. (XYZ) was at $56 a month ago when a trader purchased the March 50 / 55 call vertical for $4.00 and shares found themselves still at $56 at expiration, the trader would realize a $1.00 profit. 

  

As for the basic risks, this position is generally viewed as one, which has a higher likelihood of profit. However those profits are also smaller than those associated with an at or out-of-the-money vertical. As much, the potential dollar risk when those lesser likelihoods do rear their ugly head will be large as the spread's full initial debit is ultimately at stake. 

  

Also, in the scenario where both options are fully in the money by a good amount at expiration, it's also always a good policy to close the position, even if it means giving up a few pennies. The trader should be able to take home the max profit without taking action as normally both contracts would be exercised automatically, leaving the trader with his or her cash profit and no position. 

  

Ultimately though and while rare, this could open up the trader to having long stock if the other side doesn't decide to claim their shares via exercising. And as that would take deliberate action on the part of that trader, that's not a position I'd like to be put in come the next trading session; which we'll confidently assume would be a hurtful one for bulls.

Nike stock has been in a nice uptrend lately with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The stock is also above a rising [21-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) which suggests that medium-term momentum is bullish.




With the market looking a little extended here, Nike might rally a little further. But possibly not too much further.


In situations like this, I like to use a diagonal call spread. This is an advanced options strategy because it utilizes options over two different expiration periods as well as two different strike prices.


Nike Stock Diagonal Option Strategy
-----------------------------------


Selling the 150 call with a Dec. 24 expiration and buying the 155 call with a Jan. 8 expiration brings in around $0.07 or $7 per contract.


The ideal scenario is that the stock rallies up to just below the short call at 150 right before its expiration.


Should NKE stock fall from here, the worst that can happen on the downside is that both calls expire worthless and the trader keeps the $7 premium.


The maximum risk on the upside is greater. That's equal to the difference between the strikes less the premium received.


With the strikes being $5 apart that makes the risk on the upside $493.


Profit And Loss Zones
---------------------


There is a nice profit zone between around 140 and 150, with a maximum potential profit estimated at around $280, but the catch is you don't want the stock to get to that zone too quickly.



In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss if Nike stock rallied up above the short call at 150. As an example, if that were to happen today, the trade might be down around $80.


[Nike stock earnings](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/) are set for after the close on Dec. 18, so there is earnings risk with this trade.


Diagonal spreads are an advanced strategy and not recommended for beginner option traders.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

By the narrowest of margins or roughly just more than 1%, shares of **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) failed to reset its base count during its price correction from all-time-highs set back in late July. Instead, shares of the growth outfit, have gone on to twist and contort itself into a quirkier triple-bottom style, high level weekly base just above the $41.18 low from June's late stage base.

  

Is that necessarily a bad thing for bulls? Our own updated prognosis is optimistic of LULU's health as we see both price and time are healers of prior excessive price behavior. For one, LULU's dip of about 34% from the fore-mentioned highs is very much in keeping with textbook declines in growth stocks during healthy climates. Secondly, given a good portion of the nearly (and long) six months spent building the base was during the broader market's correction. Shares of LULU are looking fit to us once again.

  

For bulls looking to maybe "handle" LULU's small, high level consolidation just below its all-time highs, one strategy to consider is the bull call spread. The very flexible spread buys a lower strike call and sells a higher strike call in the same contract month. This type vertical, which is also referred to as a bull call spread, has limited risk but also maintains limited upside if left unadjusted. 

  

While most commonly thought of as a directional play, the design of where the strikes are placed in relation to shares, the spacing of those strikes and which contract month is decided upon, can have a large impact on the spread's delta and vega properties. Ultimately, that's going to determine what's required or not needed of shares in order to turn the trading account to the upside.

  

Shown above and to illustrate the vertical in motion is a 4x February 62.5 / 65 call combination. Priced for $1.05, this particular spread would require LULU to move to 63.55 to breakeven at expiration. Below the lower purchased strike, the entire $1.05 is at risk, while above 65, the trader would stand to profit by $1.45 per spread.

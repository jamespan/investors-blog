With the volatility bar raised and a market determined to be under pressure for all but the staunchest bulls; how might a trader look to position for further gains in **Priceline.com**  ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) following its well-received earnings beat? The answer of course, without being presumptuous, is that positioning rests on the trader. 

  

However, if you're like me (at all) and are inclined to see today's breakout as having its own bar raised as evidenced by current market conditions and maybe PCLN's own up-channel resistance test; the idea of not putting down the big bucks by recognizing or accepting limited gains, is approachable. 

  

One spread which looks to incorporate those characteristics is a regular way all call butterfly with a slightly bullish bias using the March 475, 485 and 495 strikes.

  

  

With shares near 462.50 and making a real world tweak on pricing which requires giving a little something to the other side; the spread goes for about $1.10 with $8.90 being the "Promised Land." However, in appreciating the low probability of that type of grail-like action actually occurring; to bargain along the way and "schnitzel a lil' something" makes this low cost, low probability spread a better deal.

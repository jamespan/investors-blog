After **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) released [blowout numbers for fourth-quarter deliveries](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-flashes-buy-signal-as-record-q4-deliveries-seen/) on Sunday, shares soared 13.5% yesterday. The implied volatility is also at a relatively high level. Here's an iron condor option strategy with some adjustments particular to Tesla stock.




Adjustments For Implied Volatility And Bullish Bias
---------------------------------------------------


Tesla stock ranks No. 3 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an EPS Rating of 72 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 98.


Today, we're going to look at an iron condor example on TSLA stock, but with a slight difference. As a reminder, an iron condor combines a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


Instead of a standard neutral trade, we will structure this iron condor on Tesla stock with a bullish bias. This can be achieved by placing the put spread closer to the stock price than the calls.


Implied volatility for Tesla stock is at 67%. That's toward the higher end of the twelve-month range of 36% to 90%. The IV rank is 57% and the IV Percentile is 79%. We can make some adjustments there too.


When volatility is high, an iron condor can be placed further out-of-the-money, giving the trade a higher chance at success.


Setting Up The Tesla Stock Iron Condor Trade
--------------------------------------------


Tesla stock closed just under 1,200 yesterday. So where do we set our strikes?


First, let's take the bull put spread. Using the Jan. 21 expiry, we could sell the 1,150 put and buy the 1,125 put. That spread sold for around $9.20 yesterday.


Then, for the bear call spread, we sell the 1,425 call and buy the 1,450 call. This spread sold for around $2.05 yesterday.


In total, the iron condor will generate around $11.25 per contract, or $1,125 of premium.


Each spread has a difference of 25 between the strikes. But the short put is just 50 points away, whereas the short call is 225 points away. That gives the trade a bullish bias. The distance of the strikes from the current price gives Tesla stock a lot of room to move for a higher chance of success.


Profit And Loss For The Trade
-----------------------------


Ideally, the spread expires worthless and you keep the entire premium. That happens if Tesla stock finishes between the short strikes of 1,150 and 1,425 by expiration.


Your break-even levels are at 1,138.75 and 1,436.25. To calculate that, take the short strikes and add or subtract the premium received. So, 1150 - 11.25 = 1138.75 and 1425 + 11.25 = 1436.25. If TSLA stock falls outside of that range by expiration, below 1138.75 or above 1436.25, you're losing money.


The long strikes are your protection. If Tesla stock goes above 1,450 or below 1,125 at expiration, you incur the maximum loss. As both spreads are $25 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 25 - 11.25 x 100 = $1,375.


To calculate your return on risk, take the premium ($1,125) divided by the maximum risk ($1,375). This iron condor trade on TSLA stock has the potential to return 81.8%.


You could use a stop loss in this case based on 25% of capital at risk, so a loss of around $345.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Solar stocks seem to be back in vogue, and **Daqo New Energy** ([DQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DQ)) is currently the No. 1-ranked stock in the solar energy industry group.




DQ stock has pulled back from a high of 77.18 and has successfully tested the rising [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) in what could be a bullish sign.


Daqo Energy is showing green check marks across the board, and today we will look at a bullish option strategy on this China-based solar manufacturer.


One way to gain exposure to a stock without risking too much is via a bull call spread rather than buying the stock outright. This can be a good way to protect precious capital in these volatile markets.


Let's assume a trader has a price target of 80 between now and mid-January. 


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Setting Up DQ Stock Option Spread
---------------------------------


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to January expiration, a 70-strike call option was trading around $11.40 on Friday, and the 80 call was around $8.10.



Buying the 70 call and selling the 80 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $330 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100), and the maximum potential profit would be $670 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if DQ stock closes below 70 on Jan. 20, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $330 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 80. So, no matter how high DQ stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $670.


Closing The Daqo Stock Trade
----------------------------


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 60, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is another stock that looks strong, having crossed above the [200-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/). And [this option idea](https://www.investors.com/research/options/apple-stock-is-mounting-a-comeback-why-this-diagonal-spread-can-earn-500/) from last week continues to perform well.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

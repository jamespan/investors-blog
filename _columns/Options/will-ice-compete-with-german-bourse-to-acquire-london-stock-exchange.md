Intercontinental Exchange is lining up financing for a bid for the London Stock Exchange Group, according to people familiar with the matter, as it prepares to go head to head with Deutsche Boerse to win control of the U.K. company.


**Intercontinental Exchange** ([ICE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ICE)), which is working with **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) and Moelis & Co. to explore a takeover of LSE, is in discussions with banks to fund a formal offer in the coming weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Talks are at an early stage, no final decision has been made on the timing or size of the bid, and ICE could still decide against an offer, they said.


Deutsche Boerse and LSE on Feb. 23 announced talks to combine and create a global player worth at least 20 billion pounds ($28 billion), which could better compete with ICE as well as **CME Group** ([CME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CME)), the world’s largest derivatives market. A formal proposal from ICE or Deutsche Boerse could spark a bidding war between the suitors, which each have until late March to make an official offer for the bourse under the U.K.’s takeover rules.


Deutsche Boerse is likely to announce the details of a merger plan with LSE as early as next week, according to a different person familiar with the matter. ICE, which sees the potential to generate more cost savings with LSE than Deutsche Boerse, is likely to wait until after the Germans bid, one of the people said.


CME Group is also working with advisors to assess whether it could challenge the deal, people familiar with the matter said last week.


Representatives for ICE and LSE declined to comment. An official for Deutsche Boerse didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

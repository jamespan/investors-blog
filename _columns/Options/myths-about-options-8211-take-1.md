Options may have more myths about them than any subject related to investing and trading. These myths persist despite the industry's existence in the U.S. for 40 years. This is the first in a series of articles that address several myths about options and try to set the record straight.

  

**Myth #1: Options are only for speculators.**

  

Perhaps you have heard something like this, "When I invest, I buy stock. When I speculate, I buy options." This thinking misses the concept that options are insurance-like instruments. Insurance is purchased when the goal is to limit risk, and insurance is sold when the goal is to increase income. Every strategy has a risk, of course, and one risk of buying insurance is that the premium paid is lost. The risk of selling insurance is that someone may come to collect.

  

Limiting the risk of market exposure is an investment activity, not speculation. Put options can be purchased to protect a stock position against a market decline, and calls can be purchased to protect cash investments from missing a market rally.

  

Increasing income from investment positions is also an investment activity, not speculation. If neutral price action is forecast, then calls can be sold against owned stock, and puts can be sold against cash investments. The goal of these strategies is to increase income, but both strategies have the real risk of a significant stock price decline. Both strategies also have the opportunity risk of missing a significant stock price rise.

  

One important distinction between investing and speculating is how capital is managed. First, consider "conservative" capital management when buying stock. Buying stock and fully paying for it in cash is a non-leveraged approach to investing.

  

Next, consider "risky" capital management when buying stock. If stock is purchased in a margin account with 50% of an investor's capital and a 50% margin loan, then both profit and risk are "leveraged." Leverage means that profits or losses are greater in percentage terms than the price change in the underlying stock. If a $100 stock is purchased with $50 of the investor's capital and a $50 margin loan, for example, then a $5, or 5%, price rise in the stock results in a $5, or 10%, profit on the investor's $50 of capital. Similarly, a 5% decline in the stock price results in a 10% loss of the investor's capital.

  

Now consider how capital can be managed in "conservative" and "risky" fashions using options. First, assume the following: available capital is $100, the stock price is $100 and the price of the 60-day 100-strike call is $5. An investor who wants to participate in a predicted stock price rise and limit risk at the same time can employ a two-part strategy. First, the 60-day 100-strike call is purchased for $5 and, second, $95 is deposited in a money market account. If the stock price rises to $120 at option expiration, then the 100-strike Call will rise to $20 for a profit of $15 per share, not including commissions. If measured against the $100 total capital, the profit is 15%, which is less than the 20% profit from purchasing stock at $100 and selling it at $120. This "call-plus-money-market" strategy had a maximum risk of $5, or 5% of total capital plus commissions, while buying stock had $100 of risk.

  

How might options be used in a "risky," or leveraged, manner? Assuming the same $100 in total capital, a person who buys 20 100-strike calls for $5 each is taking a highly leveraged and speculative position. If the stock price rises above $105 at expiration, then the profit will be 20 times that of one call. On the losing side, however, if the stock price does not rise, then the entire $100 capital plus commissions is at risk.

  

**Myth #2: 90% of options expire worthless.**

  

Contrary to popular belief, selling options is not "free money"! The thinking seems to be that, "since 90% of options expire worthless, I should sell them and make that money." There are two things that contradict this notion. First, the facts do not support it, and, second, common sense does not support it.

  

Since the beginning of the listed options industry in the U.S., the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) has kept monthly statistics on the percentage of options that are exercised, closed prior to expiration or expire worthless. A copy of the latest annual "Market Statistics" brochure is available from the Web site of the Chicago Board Options Exchange at http:www.cboe.com. Nearly 40 years of statistics indicate that, on average, approximately 15% of options are exercised, approximately 55% are closed prior to expiration, and approximately 30% expire worthless. "Closed" means "traded out of," i.e., long, or purchased, options are sold, and short, or written, options are repurchased. Note that this data does not reveal how many trades are profitable.

  

Common sense also suggests that option writers do not have an advantage. If option writers did have an advantage, then profit-seeking investors would enter the market and sell options in an attempt to make "excess returns." The impact of so many option sellers would be to force option prices down. Options prices would then be driven down to the point where sellers would no longer have an advantage over buyers. At that point the market would be in a state of equilibrium.

  

Rather than believe that one strategy is "better" than another, investors and traders who use options should test more than one strategy for a given forecast in an attempt to estimate which strategy has the better risk/reward ratio. The CBOE's Web site has [a free options calculator](http://www.cboe.com/framed/IVolframed.aspx?content=http%3a%2f%2fcboe.ivolatility.com%2fcalc%2findex.j%3fcontract%3d4C42DC0E-A17A-4389-8FE0-8492C608A5DD&sectionName=SEC_TRADING_TOOLS&title=CBOE%20-%20IVolatility%20Services) (under the TOOLS tab), that can be used to analyze option strategies.

  

**Conclusion**

  

Your chances of success are improved if you approach trading like a business. What is your method of market forecasting, and how will you apply that method? How will you manage your capital? How much time per day, per week or per month will you devote to trading?

  

Rather than worry about broad generalizations, such as the common myths about options discussed above, think about how you define success and make a step-by-step plan that will help you achieve that success.

IBD 50 constituent **Endo Pharmaceutical**  ([ENDP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ENDP)) was atop the unusual option volume list amongst its constituents with more than 7,500 contracts changing hands versus its daily average of 1,300. Likely closing action in the out-of-the-money February 40 call has seen volume of about 1,300 contracts priced around $0.10. This appears to be the closing down of positions with the option set to expire Friday and open interest of 7,900. 

  

A slightly more mixed situation looked to be present in the near-the-money February 35 puts, which has traded nearly 1,600 contracts with a last sale of $0.65. While the contract sports similar open interest to the fore-mentioned call, the pricing and nearness of shares to the strike opens up the potential for fresh initiations, both buyers and sellers, versus the well-out-of-the money call and whose price dictates closing of risk so near to expiration. 

  

Of a bit more interest are 2,000 time spreads put up using the March / February 35 calls for $1.40.Given the nearness of February expiration and larger open interest of 3,300 contracts, it's likely the calendar is actually a roll on an outright long or short call position in which the trader wishes to roll out into the longer-dated contract month. 

  

For a bull holding an existing long February call, the execution of this spread order includes notification of the trader closing his or her long February contract, while simultaneously "opening" with the purchase of the March call. If no other prior adjustments or hedges have been involved, this transaction increases the trader's dollar risk of the original purchased February 35 call by the $1.40 debit. 

  

In effect, the trader will own the March call for $1.40 plus the unknown price paid for the February call. With the contract currently priced at $2.90, if the trader paid less than $1.50 for the February, then they'll have some sort of paper profit on the new position. For instance, if some time earlier when shares were priced lower, they paid $0.75 per contract for February; they'd own March for $2.15 versus the market price of $2.90. 

  

In the end, this type of one-for-one swap into the longer-dated contract will increase a trader's risk exposure. However and as noted, there could be some profitable breathing room to consider. And technically speaking, with shares attempting to find a key handle pivot low off Golden Cross and 50% support within a corrective weekly cup-shaped base of 10 months, we can't altogether the option to roll with the punches.

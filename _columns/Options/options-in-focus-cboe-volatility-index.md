With an hour remaining in Thursday's session and the S&P 500 off about 0.8% near session lows and through 1400 in front of Friday's closely watched Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls release, you might think the CBOE Volatility Index would be showing some sympathetic concern. You'd also be dead wrong and maybe somewhat amazed as this strategist admittedly is. 

  

As the market's most notorious gauge of investor sentiment and one well correlated in its tendency to perk up during times of market unease or uncertainty, Thursday's strong sounding 5.75% bid is really anything but. In fact, at a level of 17%, the index is squarely in historically neutral territory spanning a 10-point wide zone from 12 to 13% to about the 20 to 22% area. 

  

What's more and in this current market environment, mean reversion in the index is upon traders and reflecting a very neutral tone in sentiment with the VIX resting on its 10, 30 and 50-day simple moving averages. How might that be interpreted you ask? Well on the one hand, the action could be viewed negatively and confirmation for bears expecting lower prices. 

  

That train of thought lies in the belief the neutral condition is still too confident in front of what should prove to be a very important report. Toss in items like the market now having entered its "Worst Six" calendar period, a very nice "Best Six" price run and not too mention the massive run of the past three years and change and that evidence is improved upon. 

  

On the other more optimistic hand, could the neutral condition in the VIX or what might be interpreted to as nerves of steel attitude by investors be a hint the market's current uptrend isn't in jeopardy and "Sell in May" tendencies will "Go away" quietly in 2012? We don't know for certain, though we can say that with one trader's cup-shaped weekly base in the S&P 500 also resembling a less optimistic lower high double top; neutral prices for protection leave less to the imagination and a great opportunity to reduce risk for both bulls and bears.

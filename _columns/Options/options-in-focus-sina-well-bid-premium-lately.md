With option premiums in the likes of the CBOE Volatility index just off 52-week and multi-year lows near 15%, well-bid premium i.e. high implied volatility, outside of names with earnings in their immediate future isn't all that common these days. Bid premium is even typically harder to come by if shares of the underlying instrument have held up well compared to the broader market, which as many can see on the chart of the S&P 500, is on less firm technical footing these days.

  

One hot spot defying those type odds and seeing elevated premiums as investors reach for protection with earnings still just more than a month out is **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)). Implieds in both its May and June contracts have spiked to levels not seen in more than a few months and already above the prices associated with its last report back on March 1. 

  

So, what gives? Bottom line, shares of SINA have quickly gone into a technical phase looking more than a bit parabolic in nature. Since staging a breakout in the 95 to 100 area back in mid March, shares are up in excess of 40%, punctuated by Monday's near 16.50% gain and today's continued push higher of more than 5% and intraday jump of nearly 10%. 

  

Implieds as you might well be aware, normally retreat when shares of a stock move smartly higher. During more pleasant market conditions, protection offered by purchased contracts is reduced as hand-in-hand, investor confidence grows and strategies such as buy-writes become de rigueur as far as being the right strategy to apply.

  

Further, shorting during such a move can be extra risky if the move in the underlying continues to make good on Wall Street adages like the trend is your friend or persistent trends can last longer than your wallet can hold out. In the end and under such circumstances, the compensation for shorting calls and / or premium in general can be every bit as damaging, if not even more, as an aggressive move lower in shares could ever be.

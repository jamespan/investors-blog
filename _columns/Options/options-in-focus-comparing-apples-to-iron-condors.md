One man's triple-slanted-bearish top can, at times, be the other guy's still under development but optimistic-looking double-bottom base. And in other instances, it's the market's second largest capitalization stock and reigning computer gadget goliath, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)).

  

Seeing how there looks to be technical arguments for both bears and bulls in Apple's stock and since earnings (and a potential catalyst) aren't until April 20, the idea of a short iron condor comes to mind as a way to capture profits as a more neutral minded option hedge hog.

  

Looking at the options board, with the April contract expiring a week prior to the event and also highly sensitive to time decay with just 15 calendar days left in its life; traders might be conclude April is the best month with which to focus for this type of non-directional income strategy. However, there may actually be a stronger, albeit less profitable choice to consider. 

  

The problem with collecting on an April iron condor is its decay has large and growing levels of attached negative gamma. This Greek factor, which negatively impacts the spread's delta, can quickly work against the short iron condor this close to expiration. An adverse move in shares can quickly maximize one of the two embedded short verticals within the position. 

  

In order to circumvent this potential problem, the trader might consider going out one expiration month to the May contract with the intention to exit the spread as we reach April expiration. 

  

  

Unfortunately, the trader should expect to see much smaller profits with a May iron condor, in the event everything goes as planned and shares idle between our short strikes through the third Friday in April. 

  

Above, readers can focus on a "time managed" May exit which lines up with expiration for the April contract by looking at the annotated dark blue and grey risk lines of two short iron condor positions using the same strikes and position sizing. 

  

In the end, we can see there would be much less to bring home with the May position if shares of AAPL do cooperate; although traders could reasonably consider increasing the number of May spreads versus the April iron condor, to find a slightly better risk-to-reward fit. 

  

More importantly and even if you did take that type step, the good news is the risk associated with an unwanted pre-earnings move through either short strike or all the way through one of the two verticals, will be, guaranteed, a much less painful or umm, "taxing" loss, should things not go as dreamed about despite our best laid plans.

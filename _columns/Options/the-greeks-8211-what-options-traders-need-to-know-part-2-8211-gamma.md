How and why option prices change is a mystery to many options traders. This is the second in a series of articles that discuss the seemingly complex topic of options price behavior. Actually, it is not complex at all.

  

**Option Price Behavior — Delta Reviewed**

  

As discussed in [last week's article](http://news.investors.com/investing-options/070313-662478-the-greeks-and8211-what-options-traders-need-to-know-part-1-and8211-delta.htm), "delta" estimates the change in option price for a one dollar change in stock price, assuming other factors such as time to expiration and volatility remain constant. If the stock price rises or falls by $1.00, then the option price will rise or fall by its delta. Deltas of calls are positive, so calls rise in price when stock prices rise and fall when stock prices fall. Deltas of puts, however, are negative; so put prices fall when stock prices rise and rise when stock prices fall.

  

In other words, "delta" is the share equivalency of an option position.  If you have a call option with a delta of +.65 (plus 65%) for example, then you can expect to make $65 if the stock price rises $1.00 per share. Owing this call is like owning 65 shares of stock.

  

**Gamma Defined**

  

If deltas remained constant, trading options would be similar to trading stock, at least with respect to predicting results if a forecast is accurate. If you predict that a stock price will rise $5.00 per share, for example, then it is easy to predict that buying the stock will result in a $5.00 per-share profit if the forecast is right. Similarly, if delta were constant (which it is not), then predicting a $5.00 stock price rise would indicate a call option profit of $5.00 times the call's delta.

  

Unfortunately, estimating the results of options positions is more complicated, because deltas change. Gamma is the estimated change in delta for a one dollar change in stock price.

  

Table 1 contains theoretical values, deltas and gammas of a hypothetical 100 Call option at different stock prices and different days to expiration. The purpose of Table 1 is to illustrate some basic concepts of how options price change and how deltas and gammas change as stock price and time change. The rows in Table 1 represent the stock prices, and the columns represent the number of days to expiration.  
   
First, look at delta. In row 5, column 1, the stock price is 100 and there are 90 days to expiration.  In this cell, the price of the 100 Call is 5.09, and the delta is .53 (or 53%). Now look at the cell that is up a row in row 6 in column 1 in which the stock price is 101 at 90 days to expiration. The stock price has increased by one dollar to 101, but the price of the 100 Call has increased by 53 cents to 5.62. The change in the price of the call is equal to the delta of .53 in row 5, column 1.

  

Now look at Gamma. In row 5, column 1, the delta is .53 (or 53%) and the gamma is 0.032. Moving up to row 6 in column 1, the delta is now .56 which is 0.03 greater than .53. The stock price has increased by one dollar to 101 and the delta has increased from .53 to .56, a change approximately equal to the gamma of .032 in row 5, column 1.

  

Looking up and down the columns in Table 1, you can see that the concept of gamma holds true, although the changes in delta are not always exactly equal to the gamma. This is due to two factors. First, gamma is "small" relative to delta. Note that gamma is shown to three decimal places, while delta is shown to two places. Second, gammas also change; so the change in delta is dynamic.

  

**Rules about Gamma**

  

Table 1 illustrates two important concepts about gamma. First, gamma is biggest when an option is at the money. The gammas in row 5, for example, when the stock price is 100, are bigger than the gammas in any other row. This means that when an option is at the money, its delta will change faster than when it is either in the money or out of the money. For most traders the significance of this is not important, because gamma is small to begin with and most changes in gamma occur in the third decimal point.

  

Second, gamma rises as expiration approaches. In any row in Table 1, the gamma increases from column 1 to column 6. This occurs because, at expiration, an option is either exercised or assigned and becomes either a long or short stock position (with a delta of +1.00 or −1.00), or the option expires worthless and has a gamma of zero. Therefore, as expiration approaches, an option's chances of becoming stock or expiring worthless fluctuate up and down, sometimes dramatically so. For options traders, this means that profits (or losses) can expand or disappear quickly as the option's delta rises and falls.

  

**Positive Gamma and Negative Gamma**

  

Positive gamma means the delta of a position changes in the same direction as the change in price of the underlying stock. Simply stated, positive gamma means that, if the stock price rises, then the delta of the position also rises (increases toward +1.00). And, if the stock price falls, the delta also falls (decreases toward 0.00). Long call and long put positions have positive gamma.

  

Refer to row 5, column 1, in Table 1, and assume that the 100 call is purchased for 5.09 per share. As this point, this call has a delta of +.53 and a gamma of +.033. If the stock price rises, then the delta rises to +.56. If the stock price falls, then the delta falls to +.50. In this case, if the stock price rises, the delta also rises; if it falls, the delta also falls. Positive gamma is generally considered to be "good," because a position with positive gamma tends to make more than the delta estimates it will make or lose less than the delta estimates it will lose. 

  

Negative gamma means the delta of a position changes in the opposite direction as the change in price of the underlying stock. Negative gamma means that, if the stock price rises, then the delta of the position falls (decreases toward −1.00). And, if the stock price falls, the delta rises (increases toward 0.00). Short call and short put positions have negative gamma.

  

Refer to row 5, column 3, in Table 1, and assume that the 100 call is sold for 4.14 per share. As this point, this short call has a delta of −.53 (negative .53) and a gamma of −.040 (negative .040). If the stock price rises, then the delta falls to −.57. Note that a change from −.53 to −.57 is a decrease of .040 . And, if the stock price falls, then the delta rises to −.49. In this case, if the stock price rises, the delta falls; if it falls, the delta rises. Negative gamma is generally considered to be "bad," because a position with negative gamma tends to make less than the delta estimates it will make or lose more than the delta estimates it will lose.

  

**Is Gamma Useful?**

  

At this point, having heard about the theory of gamma, when it is high and low, how it changes and what positive and negative gamma are, you might be wondering, "Does this really matter to me and my trading?" This is a good question, and the answer depends on your trading style and the number of contracts you trade.

  

It is important for all traders to understand the concept of gamma, that delta changes, and, as a result, that your options positions will make or lose a little more or less than the delta indicates. For most traders, however, it is not necessary to know the exact gamma of a position. Only traders with large numbers of contracts need to concern themselves with exactly how quickly and by how much their market exposure will change.

  

**Conclusion**

  

Deltas change, and gamma estimates that change. The delta of an option tells you your share-equivalent market exposure right now, and gamma tells you how quickly that exposure will change. If a position has a positive gamma, the delta of that position will change in the same direction as the change in the price of the underlying. Negative gamma means the delta will change in the opposite direction as the change in price of the underlying.

  

Traders who know the gamma of their positions will have a quick estimate of how much their delta will change. The concept of gamma is important to understand, but most traders do not need to know the exact gamma of their positions.

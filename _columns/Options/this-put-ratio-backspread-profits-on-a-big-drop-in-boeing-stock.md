In this column, we've mainly looked at some of the standard option trades like vertical spreads, iron condors and cash secured puts. Today, we're going to look at one of the less common option strategies, called a put ratio backspread with Boeing stock.




A put backspread involves selling a put and then buying two further out-of-the-money puts. This strategy is used when a trader is expecting a large drop in a particular stock.


The advantage of using a backspread is a much lower cost than simply buying a put option.


Put Ratio Backspread With Boeing Stock
--------------------------------------


**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) stock is showing weak ratings overall. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 26, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 53 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 24. On a chart, the downtrend in BA stock started back in March and it's trading below both its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.



A put ratio backspread on Boeing stock means you think the weakness will continue in Boeing stock and it is likely to experience a big drop in the next few weeks. Here's how you would set it up:


Sell 1 Feb. 180 put on BA stock @ 8.80


Buy 2 Feb. 170 puts on BA stock @ 5.45


You receive premium for the 180 put of about $880 and spend $1,090 in premium for the two 170 puts. The net cost for the trade is $210.


Profit And Loss For A Put Ratio Backspread
------------------------------------------


Boeing stock closed at around 188 yesterday. If BA stock stays above 180 at expiration, the trader loses the small amount of premium. That loss actually increases as the stock falls to 170 at expiration which is where you see your maximum loss of $1,210 on the trade. You would loss the premium paid ($210) plus the difference of the long an short strikes X 100 ($1,000). Your losing money on your short 180 put and you don't have the long puts kicking in to offset it.


As Boeing stock falls gets further below 170 at expiration, your loss gets smaller and eventually your two puts at 170 will overtake the loss on the short 180 put. That's when you make a profit.


The maximum gain is unlimited up to the point the stock reaches $0. As for exposure, the initial delta on the trade is -14. That's roughly equivalent to being short 14 shares of BA stock.


This is an advanced trading strategy and not recommended for beginners.


Managing The Trade
------------------


I wouldn't hold this trade for more than two to three weeks just in case Boeing stock doesn't make a large downside move as expected.


Remember, your ideal scenario for the trade is a huge drop in the stock (and associated rise in implied volatility) within the first few weeks.


Earnings for Boeing stock are set for late January, so there would be earnings risk with this trade if held to expiration.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

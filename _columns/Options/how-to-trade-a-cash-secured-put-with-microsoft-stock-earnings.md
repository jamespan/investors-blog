Microsoft stock has a strong history of rallying in the lead-up to earnings, particularly when it's above the 50-day moving average.




This is a common occurrence with strong stocks. We looked at some recent examples with a [diagonal call spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/paypal-stock-earnings-option-play-could-be-worth-1000/) in **PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) and a [poor man's covered call](https://www.investors.com/research/options/veeva-stock-why-this-poor-mans-covered-call-veeva-could-deliver/) in **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)).


Another option trade to consider for **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) is a cash-secured put.


Cash-Secured Put Option Strategy
--------------------------------


A cash-secured put involves selling an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock.


The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to take assignment and acquire the stock below the current price. While we aren't usually interested in picking up stocks on weakness, Microsoft stock is a member of the [IBD Long-Term Leaders List](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-long-term-leaders-screen/). Pullbacks are often a better entry for those types of stocks.


The cash-secured put is very similar to a covered call. Once you know the basics, it's quite easy to understand.


It's important that anyone selling puts understands that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


Microsoft Stock Cash-Secured Put Setup
--------------------------------------


For Microsoft stock, a trader selling the put with a 215 strike and Oct. 30 expiration could generate around $6 in premium per contract.


As the put seller, you have the obligation to purchase 100 shares of Microsoft stock at 215 if called upon to do so by the put buyer.


The break-even price for the trade can be calculated by taking the strike price less the premium received. In this case, that's a break-even price of 209.


It provides a 2.6% cushion from yesterday's closing price on Microsoft stock.



The maximum loss on the trade occurs if MSFT stock falls to 0. In that unlikely event, the trade loses $20,900.


If Microsoft stock stays above 215 at expiry, the put option expires worthless. The full $600 premium collected is kept with a generous 2.9% return on capital at risk in a short time.


This return is calculated by taking the $600 premium received divided by the $20,900 capital at risk.


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If Microsoft stock falls precipitously, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the loss will be partially offset by the premium received for selling the put. It gives you a little cushion on the trade.


Why Cash-Secured Puts?
----------------------


Cash secured puts are a fantastic way to generate a return on stocks the trader is happy to own.


With this example, the trader either generates a 2.9% return in 9 days, or they get to purchase MSFT stock at a slight discount to yesterday's price.


Microsoft reports earnings on Oct. 27. A big move is possible in either direction. The options market is currently pricing in a 6.1% move.


This is a bullish trade that should only be placed if traders think MSFT stock will stay above 215, or 209 at worst.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) stock was yesterday's [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) and is showing an improving [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/).




Yesterday's rally was in part driven by the news that Cathie Wood's Ark Next Generation Internet ETF ([ARKW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARKW)) [started a sizable position](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/draftkings-stock-breaks-out-to-buy-zone-hot-investor-buys-dkng-stake/). Implied volatility has popped recently from 65% to near 85% which means higher option premiums for put sellers.


Let's take a look at how a cash secured put trade might look on DKNG stock.


As a reminder, A cash-secured put involves writing (selling) an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


It's important that anyone selling puts understands that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


**DKNG Stock Cash Secured Put Option Trade**
--------------------------------------------


Let's assume that we are happy to buy 100 shares of DKNG stock at a price of 55 any time between now and March 19. Selling a March 19 55 put would generate around $435 in premium if sold for 4.35. This would give a break-even price of 50.65.



If the put were to expire worthless, that would represent an annual return of 71.24% calculated as follows:


Premium (435)/Capital at risk (5,065) x days in a year (365)/days until option expiration (44).


Instead of selling a one month put, what would it look like if we sold a longer term put? Let's take a look.


The May 21 put with a strike price of 55 is trading for around 7.50 which gives a break-even price of 47.50. While there is a long time to expiration, the annualized return is still quite good at 53.86% with a much lower break-even price.


The calculation is:


Premium (750)/Capital at risk (4750) x 365/107


Selling short term puts results in a higher annualized return but a higher break-even price. Longer term puts have a lower annualized return but also a lower break-even price.


Each investor should find a style that suits them, and I hope you enjoyed analyzing the difference between these two ideas on DKNG stock.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

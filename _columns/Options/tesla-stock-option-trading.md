**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) stock looks to be holding above support at 215 for now, and today I want to look at a strategy with a healthy income potential on the upside and a substantial profit zone on the downside.




The strategy is called a broken wing butterfly and we'll use puts because the strikes will all be below the stock price. This helps to reduce assignment risk.


With a regular butterfly option trade, the wings are placed an equal distance from the short strike. But with a broken wing butterfly, we leave a larger gap on a particular side. This results in less risk on one side and more risk on the opposite side.


Building Tesla Stock Trade
--------------------------


Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on [Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-a-buy-or-a-sell-in-2024/).


* Buy 1 Sept. 20, 190 put @ 2.65
* Sell 2 Sept. 20, 210 put @ 6.60
* Buy 1 Sept. 20, 220 put @ 9.95


Notice that the upper strike put is 10 points away from the middle put, and the lower put is 20 points away.


This broken wing butterfly trade will result in a net credit of $60, which means there is no risk if the stock remains above 220.


If all the puts expire worthless, it leaves the trader with a $60 gain. Based on the capital at risk of $940, that works out to be a 6.38% return.


On the downside, the maximum loss is calculated by taking the difference in the widths (10) multiplied by 100, minus the credit received. That gives us 10 x 100 – 60 = $940.


The maximum gain is calculated as 10 x 100 + 60 = $1,060.


Ideal Scenario For Tesla Stock Trade
------------------------------------



The ideal scenario for the trade is that Tesla stock stays flat initially and then slowly drifts lower to close around 210 at expiration. There is a large profit zone between 200 and 220.


The trade starts with delta of 4, so has a slight bullish bias to start. But that will flip to negative delta closer to expiry if the stock is still above 220.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 20% of the capital at risk, or if Tesla breaks below 200.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-tesla-tsla.aspx), Tesla stock is ranked No. 3 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 68, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 59 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 75.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

After pulling back to its 200-day moving average line, **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)) is showing signs of a comeback. A bull put spread could be an option setup to capture part of the move in Roku stock.




Roku Stock Improves Since May Bottom
------------------------------------


The [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-roku-inc-cl-a-roku.aspx) lists Roku stock as the top stock in the Leisure-Movies and Related Group. It has a Composite Rating of 86 and an EPS Rating of 86. Since Roku stock's May bottom, its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) climbed from 66 to 91.


Now that it's above its rising 21- and 50-day moving averages as well, more traders could be looking for the strength to continue. A bull put spread option trade offers a way to participate in a portion of a move up while limiting risk on the downside.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor sells an out-of-the-money put and buys a further out-of-the-money put.


For example, selling the 360 put on Roku stock with a July 16 expiration and buying the 355 put with the same expiration creates a bull put spread. Both puts are out-of-the-money because Roku stock closed at 380 Monday.


This spread traded around $1.60 Monday as a credit. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $160 in option premium for a 100-stock block because the sold put is worth more than the bought put.


Risks And Rewards On Bull Put Spread Option Trade
-------------------------------------------------



To calculate the maximum risk, take the difference between the strike prices and subtract the premium received. That comes out to $340 per contract of 100 shares.


If Roku stock closes above 360 at the July 16 expiration, the options expire worthless and you keep the premium received as your maximum profit. That represents a 47.1% return on risk between now and July 16.


If Roku stock closes below 355 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $340.


Break-even And Stop Loss Points
-------------------------------


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 358.40, which is calculated as 360 less the 1.40 option premium per contract.


This bull put spread trade on Roku stock has a delta of 4. That means it is a similar exposure to owning four shares of ROKU stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1.60 to $3.20, I would consider closing early for a loss.


With earnings set for early August, this trade should have no earnings risk.


Remember options are risky. Investors can lose 100% of their investment.

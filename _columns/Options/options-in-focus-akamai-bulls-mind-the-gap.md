Erstwhile and maybe future growth stock **Akamai** ([AKAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AKAM)) was making the rounds today in that darker area of stock trafficking called the rumor mill. With shares up about 1.75% on the day, strength was attributed to "renewed M&A" chatter according to Briefing.com. 

  

Option traders appeared to be acting sympathetically. Premiums in AKAM are well-bid and call activity has taken a commanding lead over puts by a margin of four-to-one on overall heavy trading of nearly 35,000 contracts. However, two other factors of notice are also acting as likely influences on Monday's bulls. 

  

Wednesday after the closing bell, Akamai will report its earnings. Analysts expect the company to post profits of $0.37 per share. Last quarter Akamai warned on its outlook which had the impact of technically breaking the stock on a bearish gap below 200-day simple moving support. 

  

As it turns out and in front of this quarter's event, shares of AKAM are testing prices associated with the -15% fallout from February 10. With a sizable gap overhead, can option bulls be faulted for maybe placing wagers aligned with the Street adage of "all gaps getting filled?" 

  

In sympathy, most active on the day with shares at 40.65 are nearly 4,000 May 45 calls which have traded. Priced at $0.76 per contract, a double by expiration would require a move just more than 14% to roughly 46.50. That's about 2% above the 200-day line and near the top of the gap of 47.99. 

  

In truth, we don't know whether traders today were opening or closing due to a larger existing open interest statistic of 6,900. However, a firm bid in implieds to fresh two plus month highs and well above statistical volatility does augur that directional bulls were active in general on Monday. 

  

Beyond that, my two cents on those matters of buying naked calls is if given the chance to put on a lower cost, below market price spread in the next two sessions; I'd consider it. Given AKAM's one point strikes and very strong liquidity; you're likely to find you'll have minded the gap all the better, regardless of the outcome.

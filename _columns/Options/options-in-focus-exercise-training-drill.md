Most people would agree exercising is a key part to maintaining a healthier lifestyle. But when the question of whether exercise works better with regards to an option position arises, market circumstances are the most important factor in maintaining a more fiscally fit portfolio. 

  

Let's examine two situations in the venerable XYZ Corp. where a slight variation in option prices and the use of better judgment through synthetics would lead to stronger results by not being so near-sighted in our actions.

  

Trader Gordon Gekko has been short XYZ for some time via the January 42 put contract which he purchased after his homework told him shares were vastly overvalued at 44. With the stock trading down to 38.50 over the course of a handful of weeks, he decides it's time to exit and sell the put for a profit. But is that the right course of action? 

  

With XYZ at 38.50 the June 42 put is quoted $3.55 bid / $3.70 ask. At the same time the reciprocal call market for the out-of-money option is $0 bid / $0.15 ask. In this instance the pricing dictates that Gordon would be better off attempting to sell his put(s) in the open market rather than exercising his rights as a bear to close the put position while at the same time purchasing shares to get flat. 

  

The reason "sell to close" would work better is hitting the put bid of $3.55, would at worst, yield an extra $0.05 of profit versus exercising for parity value of $3.50. In fact, with the quoted market, Gordon could, if his position wasn't of monstrous size, could possibly squeeze out a fill of $3.60 and ten cents of extra profit. 

  

On the other hand, if the quoted markets found the put market priced $3.45 bid / $3.60 ask and the call still $0.00 bid / $0.15 ask, it would behoove Gordon to exercise the put for parity rather than what amounts to an opportunity cost of $0.05 if he hit the bid. 

  

How's that work? An easy way to think about what's at stake is to assume the sale of put is accompanied by a one-for-one sale of stock i.e. shorting shares, as if the trader is an opening synthetic call seller. The sale of $3.45 and a short of stock at 38.50 would result in having sold the call for a guaranteed minimum loss of $0.05. 

  

A sale at $3.50 or five cents above the bid would be the same as exercising but depending on a trader's commission schedule, could result in one option, pardon the pun, being better than the other.

  

Hopefully readers have come away with realizing that whether to exercise or not really boils down to looking at conversion and reversal markets, even though the trader is or will be closing out their position. In the end, there's nothing, which can be done about the P&L up to this important decision point. But option traders can always strive to exit a bit more gracefully by knowing their position's synthetic equivalent and in the process, make more "cents" off their smarter "to close" or "exercise" actions. *This archived piece is originally from January 19, 2011.*

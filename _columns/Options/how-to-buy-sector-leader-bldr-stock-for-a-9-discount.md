With the market pullback, many extended stocks have come back to earth. But maybe you want an even cheaper price. Here's an option strategy to achieve that goal and we'll use BLDR stock to illustrate.




**Builders FirstSource** ([BLDR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLDR)) is currently on a number of IBD lists. Not only did it make the list with the most stringent criteria, the [IBD Sector Leaders;](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/sector-leaders) it also holds the No. 1 spot on both the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) and [IBD Big Cap 20](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/big-cap-20/). The high ratings give you a solid reason why. BLDR stock currently shows a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 98. Nothing wrong with those numbers. 


This week, BLDR stock pulled back below its 21-day moving average line but remained above its 50-day moving average. With a stock trending as well as BLDR stock, picking up shares on a pullback to logical areas of support or moving average lines is a great way to improve your average cost in a position. But can you improve on that price even more?


Cash-secured Put On BLDR Stock
------------------------------


Enter the cash-secured put. It's a slightly less bullish trade than buying the stock outright but can allow you to acquire shares at a cheaper cost.


How would it work for BLDR stock? A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium or be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price. This is important. Traders selling puts should understand that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


Since BLDR stock traded around 79.15 yesterday, the Feb. 18 put with a strike price of 75 traded around $2.75.


An investor selling this put would receive $275 into their account. That's yours to keep. But for each contract, you also need to set aside $7,500. If BLDR falls below 75 by Feb. 18, expect to be assigned the shares and the $7,500 covers the cost for the shares. But, the effective net cost of the position would be 72.25 per share, thanks to the option premium received.


That's 8.7% below yesterday's closing price for BLDR stock.


Managing the Trade
------------------


What if BLDR stock isn't below the strike at expiration? That's not too bad either. In that case, the put on BLDR stock expires worthless and you made $275. Since you had $7,225 at risk (the amount set aside in case of assignment less the premium received), you have a 3.8% return on capital at risk. It may not seem like much but since that's in just over a month it works out to 36.6% annualized.


Why is the risk so large? It's actually similar to outright stock ownership. The maximum loss on the trade occurs in the unlikely event that BLDR stock falls to 0. Most traders would cut losses long before then. And that is still less at risk than if you bought BLDR stock at the higher price of 79.15.


If BLDR stock falls quickly, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the premium received helps offset the loss.


Cash-secured puts are a great way to generate a return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership.


If the put on BLDR stock gets assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base. Plus, you can then turn around and potentially begin selling covered calls to generate additional income from the position.


Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start with options. They are like a covered call and are pretty easy to understand once you know the basics.  

Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

With shares of IBD 50 constituent **Coinstar**  ([CSTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSTR)) off about 4.5%, option buyers looking for more authoritative limited risk positioning appear to busy Friday establishing, as best we can tell, unrelated long call and long put speculations. 

  

Concentrated efforts in fairly steady and varied size prints throughout the day have been spied in the August 75 call and August 60 put. A firm bid in implieds has taken the ATMs up about 12% to 56% on volume of 4,100 and 5,600 respectively. The overall activity easily ousts residing open interest levels andÂ suggests opening positioning by both bulls seeking long deltas and bears wishing to have downside exposure with short deltas.

  

The August 75 call is a bit more than 15% out of the money and priced around $0.75 per contract with shares at 64.25. Maintaining a delta of roughly 16, a trader naked long the call can expect to make 16 cents of profit on any initial movement higher. 

  

Continued follow-through in shares would stand to benefit the trader with even stronger profits per point as the Greek known as gamma acts to shift the delta higher. If the contract ever became deep in the money, it would sport a near perfect 100 delta synonymous with long stock.

  

  

The inverse is true for a bearish position consisting of the long August 60 put, though it's closer proximity to shares has it fetching $2.70 with a short delta of 40. 

  

The immediate threats to both these contracts are adverse share movement and the relationship of negative theta trying or countering implied volatility as extrinsic premiums suffer from increased risk of time decay during the final weeks of their life. 

  

On the other hand, further increases in implied stand to help both types of buyers. With earnings set for July 26, the August contract being the "earnings cycle" play and shares of CSTR known for some volatile and outsized reactions following its reports, it's likely premiums will experience what's known as a "volatility rush" then quickly followed by a post earnings volatility crush. 

  

In a perfect world, both sets of traders would likely desire to have shares move favorably for their respective contracts, coupled with a volatility rush that looks more like a volatility explosion. With that chain of events the trader would enjoy the best delta, gamma and vega have to offer and could make a nice adjustment prior to earnings or simply take the money and run. Well, given that there are two sides to every coin, it's easy enough to realize what can go wrong and how traders might quickly feel less secure in their limited risk endeavors.

It's not like the old days for **Cisco** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)), but in some ways that is a good thing. Shares of CSCO broke out Tuesday from a cup-shaped base seven weeks in-the-making on above average volume. The trading activity was actually its strongest since the pattern began back on February 9 when it carved out a massive volume bearish reversal candle tied to earnings.

  

In the here and now one day after a breakout, shares still situated just pennies above the proper buy point and Cisco sporting a so-so EPS of 76 but slightly more endearing Composite Rating of 90. Thus, what could possibly be better about Cisco than in its go-go dot.com heyday? 

  

Checking Cisco's option board and one great step in the right direction since those years not so long ago, but in other ways a lifetime removed, are CSCO's very well-traded one-point strikes and penny-quoted markets. For bulls that realize this time may very well be different in a less exciting sort of way than in yesteryear, a bull call vertical of one's choice might be proposed. 

  

One bull call spread which looks interesting is the somewhat in-the-money April 20 / 21 bull call. Priced for $0.55 per spread with shares at $20.61, a breakeven of $20.55 is just below current levels and the proper buy point of $20.59. If shares proceed to move just less than 2% over the next 30 calendar days, this type of bull will achieve their maximum return potential of $0.45 or roughly an 80% return on investment. 

  

Over the course of a year and in a perfect world, a near 80% return could translate into a gain nearing 1000% if replicated 12 times in a row. And while today's new cadre of growth traders might not follow Cisco these days, that's portfolio growth to be envied by one and all and maybe an option worth thinking about.

**DocuSign** ([DOCU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOCU)) stock has been quietly putting in a series of higher highs and higher lows with the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) both sloping upward. The stock is highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 75 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90.




An easy option trade worth looking at on DOCU stock is a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration. To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell a put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish DocuSign Stock Option Trade**
---------------------------------------


Traders who think DocuSign stock will not drop below 250 could look to sell a Feb. 19 250 put and buy a Feb. 19 245 put.


Yesterday, this spread was trading for around $2.30 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $230 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $270.


That represents an 85.18% return on risk between now and Feb. 19 as long as DOCU stock remains above 250. If DocuSign stock closes below 245 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $270.



The break-even point for the bull put spread is 247.70 which is calculated as 250 minus the 2.30 option premium per contract. If DocuSign's stock price drops below 245, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Earnings for DocuSign stock is set for March 4, so this trade would not have earnings risk.


The main downside for the trade is that implied volatility is only 48% which is toward the lower end of the 12-month range.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Prudential Financial** ([PRU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PRU)) offers an array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, investment management and real estate services.


Prudential stock has been a solid performer this year, with a 21.3% return so far.


The stock also has an above-average annualized dividend yield of 4.1% and was featured in the [Income Investor column last week](https://www.investors.com/research/the-income-investor/prudential-pru-stock-insurance-insurer-hurricane-milton/).




Investors who want to generate even further income could look at a covered call trade.


A covered call strategy is one way to slightly reduce the risk on a long stock position while also generating some premium. The catch is that upside is limited above the covered call strike.


Let's look at how a covered call trade on Prudential might take shape.


Buying 100 shares of Prudential would cost around $12,580, based on Tuesday's closing price.


A 5% Return In One Month
------------------------


A Nov. 15, 130-strike call option traded around $2.15, generating $215 in premium per contract.



Selling the call option generates an income of 1.7% in just under one month, equaling around 20.47% annualized.


If Prudential closes above 130 on the expiration date, the shares will be called away at 130. That leaves the trader with a total profit of $632. (The gain on the shares plus the $215 option premium received.)


That equates to a 5.11% return, which is 60.17% on an annualized basis.


Of course, the risk with the trade is that Prudential stock might drop. And that could wipe out any gains made from selling the call.


Benefits Of A Covered Call
--------------------------


Covered calls can be an effective strategy for generating income, managing downside risk and reducing the effective purchase price of a stock.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Prudential stock is ranked No. 7 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 80, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 75 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 73.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

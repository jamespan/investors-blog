Shares of IBD 50 **NetEase**  ([NTES](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NTES)) fell victim to vague but apparently worried investor concern China's economy is continuing to slow down. The stock ended lower by about 4.8% as did peers and one-time growth names **Sina** ([SINA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SINA)), **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)) and **Sohu** ([SOHU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SOHU)). And option traders appear willing to bet more downside is on the way. 

  

Checking the board, volume surged to nearly 22,000 contracts and more than 2,500% above its daily quota of about 800. Of that, puts accounted for roughly 95% of today's action and mid-term implieds ratcheted higher by about 10% to fresh three month highs. Overall, the activity suggests mostly demand driven order flow looking to position for further and by the looks of it, much harder technical weakness in shares in the weeks ahead. 

  

One such pocket of activity reflecting today's bear is the fairly well-out-of-the-money August 45 put which traded about 1,000 contracts. With no open interest to speak of, traders look to be largely opening positions with a closing price of $0.88 per contract despite the August put on the eve of its final 30 days of life and a strike which is still more than 16.5% out-of-the-money. Earnings which are set to be released on August 15 helps explain some of the attention paid to the 15-delta contract as that event will be announced a couple days prior to expiration. 

  

One-upping those bears, the further out and further out-of-the-money September 40 put saw just more than 6,900 contracts trade in more determined, mostly opening activity. An extra 36 calendar days, though sacrificing five points of strike value relative to the August 45 put, has the contract trading for roughly the same price with a mid-market close of $0.90. It's assigned delta of 11 gives it even less of a chance of being in-the-money at expiration, let alone double by that date which would require a slide of about 29% in order to fetch $1.80.

  

Some potentially good news for those would-be and obviously inspired bears, which they're possibly well aware of, Tuesday's pressure in NTES has the stock falling narrowly below support of a high level three-month long double bottom. As well, if shares are given some downside follow-through, traders aren't obliged to wait until expiration to act even more decisively. Ultimately, just a handful of percentage points can make for a much stronger adjusted position and remove the stigma and sting attached to one, of many, ways at interpreting option risk.

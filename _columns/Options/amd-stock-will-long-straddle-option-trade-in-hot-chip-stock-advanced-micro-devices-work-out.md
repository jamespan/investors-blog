**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) has traded sideways for the best part of three months. A lot of times when a stock goes through a period of price compression like this, it then experiences a [breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-stock-breakout/).




That could be a bullish breakout or a bearish breakout; we don't know. But as options traders we can set up a trade that will profit no matter which way the stock breaks out. As long as it breaks out.


The strategy I'm talking about is called a long straddle. Construct it through buying an at-the-money call and an-at-the-money put.


Buying at-the-money options can be expensive. They will also suffer from time decay, meaning that they will lose a little bit of value with each day that passes if the stock doesn't make a big move.


AMD Stock: How To Construct The Long Straddle
---------------------------------------------


A long straddle marks the opposite strategy of the [LULU trade](https://www.investors.com/research/options/short-straddle-lulu-stock-generates-option-premium/) we looked at in late June.


With a long straddle, the further out in time you place the trade, the slower the time decay. These options require more capital.


For long straddles, I usually go out about three to four months. Then I look to close the trade halfway through if the profit target or stop loss has not been hit. This helps to minimize the time decay, which gets more severe the closer the trade gets to expiration.



For AMD stock, you could place a long straddle by buying an October-month 52.50 strike call and put. The call traded Tuesday around $5.80 and the put around $5.30.

When we add the two together, the total trade would cost around $11.10 per contract, or $1,100.


This is the total amount of risk in the trade and the maximum that could be lost.


Break-Even Prices For This Option Trade
---------------------------------------



To calculate the break-even prices, subtract the straddle cost from the strike price for the lower level and add the straddle cost to the strike price for the upper level. That gives us break-even prices of 41.40 and 63.60. You can make profits with a smaller move if the move comes earlier in the trade.


For example, the estimated break-even prices at the end of July are 45 and 57.30.


Changes to [implied volatility](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) will have a big impact on this trade and the interim break-even prices, so it's important to have a solid understanding of volatility before placing a trade like this.


The worst-case scenario with this AMD long straddle would be a stable stock price that would see the call and put slowly lose value each day. For a long straddle, I usually set a stop loss at around 25% of capital at risk — around $275.


One thing to keep in mind with this trade is the earnings date for AMD stock, likely in the last few days of July. Once quarterly earnings have been released, these options could drop in value because the uncertainty surrounding the earnings release is removed.


It's important to remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

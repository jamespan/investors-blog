There's a better-than-average chance that unless investors were involved in a sketchy low-level base, maybe **Triquint Semiconductor** ([TQNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TQNT)) that they'll likely enjoyed a much stronger-than-normal uptick in the trading account. I'm kidding about TQNT and its no laughing matter to bulls playing an admittedly attractive-looking saucer shaped low, which had been completing the finishing touch on a handle in front of last night's below-views guidance. 

  

As for the vast majority of bulls out there, promises of higher prices hinted at by the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX and defended as such by this strategist just last night, have proven to be nothing short of a windfall. Tonight, we will take a hat tip for our unwavering analysis.

  

Looking forward and once again taking the pulse of the market using some quantitative and qualitative analysis with the VIX, we have some good and bad news to deliver. First, the bad or what we'd call the reality check for bulls. Short term, with the VIX nearing its 200-day simple average for the first time since July, there's a strong likelihood of prices in the sentiment gauge at least stabilizing, if not reversing. That type action generally goes hand-in-hand with profit-taking in the broader market after a sizable rally like the one we're witnessing Thursday. 

  

Additionally and a bit more quantitatively, the VIX is once again stretched well below its 10-day simple moving average and prone to some mean, but not what we'd call, nasty reversion. With the differential well above our worry benchmark of 15% and prices a full five points south of the in-play of late and historically menacing 30% level. Thus bulls should be on guard for a technical breather.

  

The good news is the price to protect any profits is about as cheap as they've been on a whole in the market since early August and at the beginning of a nasty correction from the July highs. Additionally, due to the size of the rally and one punctuated by a rather large price gap, premiums while still well above the July lows near 15% in the VIX; are more attractive in consideration of real world applications when spying strategies such as a legged married put, collar or stock substitution strategy using long at or out-of-the money calls. In the end, it's still October and treats can turn into tricks, even though we continue to see less than spooky downside.

Many longer-term traders that use options directionally enjoy implementing the collar strategy. The long-stock position combines an equivalent ratio of long at or out-of-the money puts for protection and a similar amount of short calls one or more strikes above the put for financing purposes. 

  

The risk structure limits the upside potential but the use of adjustments during a favorable run higher can allow the trader to increase his or her max return while also vastly improving upon the position's already limited downside risk. But in initiating a collar, there is more than one way to start the process. One method is to use a risk equivalent bull put spread positioned at or out-of-the money. 

  

If assigned on ensuing weakness in shares, the trader is getting exactly what they wanted when they put the vertical on, namely the opportunity to acquire shares at a below market cost to current levels with limited risk. Of course too, as opinions change to reflect new information or conditions, there's nothing saying the trader can't simply exit the vertical by closing prior to receiving assignment with either a profit still in hand or a loss but one whose risk is known for certain ahead of time.

  

A couple months back in late May, one stock bucking the market tide at the time and breaking out within the right side of its weekly base which might have warranted a bullish put "Well, I'd love to own it at such and such levels on a pullback, but with the market under correction...." vertical, was **CF Industries** ([CF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CF)). 

  

  

The fertilizer concern was up strongly and benefitting from a well-received upgrade to "Outperform" and price target of $170 courtesy of JP Morgan. One close to the money bull put vertical at that time was the 3x June 145 / 140 put spread shown above. Of course it's realized this type position and technique for entering the market isn't for everyone. But for $1.70 credit and max risk of $3.30; control is ubiquitous prior to expiration. 

  

At the end of the day or after maybe another 24 calendar days, the end result could have found the trader raking in a profit of $1.70 with the short contract still out-of-the money and then maybe, repeating the cycle. Another possibility would be closing the spread for a smaller profit or a loss of up to $3.30. 

  

It turns out the latter proved to be the reality for this particular vertical. That being said though, a third scenario (as mentioned) would be to use this vertical as a means to initiate a longer-term collar. In this particular reality, the trader winded up starting their stock ownership program $3.30 above the June expiration close near $136 but already continuing that program of marrying calls and puts with the bull has proven a much greener reality to yesterday's less maddening money.

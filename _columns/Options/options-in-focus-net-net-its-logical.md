Shares of IBD 50 constituent and semi outfit **NetLogic Microsystems**  ([NETL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NETL)) were up a healthy 9% Thursday following its earnings beat. However, digging in a bit deeper into the technicals and today's rousing good response might give good reason for existing bulls to lock in profits with a stock substitution strategy using long calls. 

  

After a quick out-the-gate jump to gains of more than 13% at session highs, late trade was coming ever closer to confirming a bearish candle pattern known as a shooting star. Furthermore and besides a personal preference to change the name to a hangman pattern, with Thursday's upside price gap shares of NETL were situated outside of a near six-month long up channel. 

  

According to Investor's Business Daily's own set of sell rules, this type of movement in shares is considered extended and makes a stock prone to profit-taking and perhaps even corrective action. As much and with attached gains of nearly 80% since channel construction began in August; I'd rather not wait to see whether or not the old Wall Street adage of "all gaps eventually get filled" becomes a reality in the immediate future. 

  

  

For existing bulls wishing to maintain some type of exposure while drastically cutting down the risk of paper profits going "Poof!" swapping out shares and using a percentage of those gains to buy long calls might be considered. 

  

With implieds down to statistical and implied range lows of the past few months, this type of bullish positioning makes a bit more theoretical sense and fewer cents to do. It also guarantees one's bottom line and allows investors to live the dream of an extended move possibly extending itself into the triple digit variety.

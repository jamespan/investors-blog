All is relatively quiet in the share price of IBD 50 constituent **Priceline.com**  ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)). With less than 90 minutes remaining in Monday's session the stock is up about 0.4% and mostly in keeping with the broader market's own 0.30% gain. But expectations as evidenced by the internet travel giant's call and put implied prices suggest both bulls and bears are buckling up for a much more dynamic move to occur in the aftermath of this evening's earnings release. 

  

Based on the mathematics behind option prices, at-the-money implieds in the Weeklys March 590 and 595 straddles of about 88% suggest a 68% or one standard deviation [1 SD] chance shares will remain within 9.20% of its current price near 592.50. 

  

The pricing or what many call the expected move is substantially greater than the most recent five reports weekly reactions. In chronological order, reactions of 3.88%, -1.83%, -5.12%, 2.5% and 6.70% back in November 2010 were secured. But the rich pricing and one suggestive of an abnormally large move isn't entirely without precedent. If we go back just one more period to the week of August 2010, shares of PCLN rocketed 31.57% for the weekly period, with 22% of that move occurring in just one day on a large price gap. 

  

To obtain the expected move calculation we took the annualized volatility figure and broke it down into a block of four trading days. That represents the amount of time on the Weeklys March contracts before this Friday's expiration. Thus we divide 365 calendar days / 4 to yield a figure of 91.25. The next step requires taking the square root of 91.25, which is 9.55. Traders can now divide the annualized implied volatility figure of 88% / 9.55 to reach our 1 SD percent boundary of 9.20%. 

  

What good is this number? Well as the theory goes, the more trader involvement there is in establishing this expected result, the more confident we should be of its worth in being accurate. That said the pricing is still far from perfect and shouldn't be taken as a say all, end all in matters of portfolio management. However, in appreciating some of what that pricing is trying to suggest to us, I certainly can't fault any bulls using the March 650 call and Monday's most active contract, as a strike to place a short call hedge.

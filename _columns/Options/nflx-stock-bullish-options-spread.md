**Netflix** (NFLX) stock is one tech stock holding up reasonably well during this mini correction.




On Friday, NFLX stock held just above the rising [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), which could be seen as a bullish sign.


NFLX stock has an excellent [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 85 but an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of only 53. Traders wanting to take some bullish exposure in a risk defined way could look at a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is created by buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside profit potential.


Going out to May expiration gives the trade plenty of time to work out. On Friday, a 580 strike call option was trading around $14.90 and the 590 call was around $13.40.


Buying the 580 call and selling the 590 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $150 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). The maximum profit potential would be $850 (the difference in strike prices multiplied by 100, less the premium paid).


NFLX Stock Bull Call Spread Has Limited Risk
--------------------------------------------


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if NFLX stock closes below 580 on April 16, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $150 premium paid.



Potential gains are also capped above 590, so no matter how high NFLX stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $850.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to NFLX stock using options.


In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $1.50 to $0.70 I would consider closing early for a loss, otherwise I would hold until expiration.


Implied volatility in NFLX stock is currently low with an IV percentile of just 18%. That means that volatility is currently lower than 82% of the readings seen in the past 12 months.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

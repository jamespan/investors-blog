The dollar swung between gains and losses as a slump in stock markets spurred haven demand for the yen, while investors reduced their exposure.


Risk aversion was evident in both the spot and options markets: Dollar-yen was lower a seventh day, set for its longest losing streak in two months, while bearish sentiment as expressed through risk reversals touched its strongest level in six weeks. Aussie-yen, a common risk barometer, was lower by the most in three months on a two-day basis.


Refuge seeking amid equities' tumble and the possibility that President Trump's fiscal policies will be delayed until Autumn didn't result in a sharp drop for the greenback. According to Europe-based traders, who asked not to be identified as they aren't authorized to speak publicly, opposing market forces kept the greenback in consolidation mode. Some investors were seen cutting back on their longs given the currency's latest weakness while others, mainly short-term accounts and fast-money names, faded the latest dip.


The greenback as measured by the Dollar Index may be due for a rebound, a relief one at least. DeMark's TD Sequential points to a recovery as a Buy Countdown was completed on March 17 while Wednesday price action also satisfies a Buy Setup series. A further 1.2% drop in DXY would suggest current decline is to extend as DeMark risk level would be breached.


Dollar bulls would have trouble finding comfort from the price action vs. the yen. The pair slipped by as much as 0.5% to 111.14, its weakest level since Nov. 23; a daily close below 111.60, the Feb. 7 low, could drag U.S. yields lower and keep pressure on the dollar. Interbank names attempted to fade the dip below 111.30, albeit in small sizes, the traders noted.

After resting for nearly five weeks in what we can now call a supportive base-on-base pattern (rather than the more cautious and maybe bearish-sounding description discussed back on these pages on January 26), shares of **Priceline.com** ([PCLN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PCLN)) have broken out. 

  

Since our last discussion of Priceline, the company has updated investors with its new and improved upcoming earnings release. The report is now scheduled for February 23 instead of February 17. As much, implieds for the February contract have come under stiff pressure relative to March. Premium bulls are in essence ridding themselves or largely avoiding the theta heavy February contract with nary a catalyst, other than the technical variety, in favor of bidding up March and what will be the front month contract come earnings. 

  

Also having come under more than a bit of pressure were two loosely discussed February 390 / 375 or 395 / 375 bear put spreads. While the then already out-of-the money positions cut down potential theta risk by 50% to 60% thereabouts and cost less than a handful of US Dollars to initiate, both spreads have unsurprisingly gone on to being essentially worthless if money management was neglected. "Doink!!??" 

  

In the here and now and with shares up about 1.9% Wednesday, for option traders willing to see today's breakout as the real deal, I'd still suggest going long a 15 or 20 point wide vertical due to pricing / premium concerns discussed prior. 

  

New to the analysis, however, would be the selection of the March contract if one were interested in looking to use earnings to one's advantage. Similar to last time's thoughts, if the trader is lucky and the stock begins the process of rallying further in front of earnings, the vertical should be in strong position for a pre-event adjustment so that holding through earnings is much closer to being a sure thing, which it never really is.

This is a good time to sit back and reflect on how you can improve your investing next year. Here are 10 ideas designed to help develop the right mind-set for using options.

  

**1. Know the difference between using options to speculate and using options to invest.** Speculators are pure traders, short-term market timers with little interest in the underlying stock, and they often use a high degree of leverage. Investors, however, use options to buy, sell, protect or increase income from stock positions, and investors do not use leverage.

  

**2. Investors who use options need a plan.** Will a purchased option be exercised or sold if it is in the money at expiration? Covered writers must know whether or not they are willing to sell the underlying stock; if not, at what price will the call be repurchased or rolled to another option? Put writers must know whether or not they are willing to buy the underlying stock; if not, at what price will a short put be repurchased, even if at a loss?

  

**3. Option traders need a three-part forecast: for a specific price change in the underlying stock, for a specific time period and for a specific change in implied volatility.** Developing a forecasting technique is a challenge for all traders, but trading options is unique because of the multi-part forecast that options require.

  

**4. Improve discipline in taking profits and losses.** First, have a profit target. Second, have a stop-loss point. Third, have a time limit. Close or reduce the size of a position if any of these points are reached. This strategy alone should increase your results. It will get you out of "old" trades and free your mind to focus on new opportunities.

  

**5. Understand and pay attention to implied volatility.** Implied volatility is the volatility percentage that justifies the market price of an option. It reflects the market's perception of the risk, or potential price range, of the underlying stock.

  

**6. Implied volatility has no absolutes.** Option traders must develop a subjective feel for "high" and "low" levels of implied volatility for each stock they trade.

  

**7. "Buying undervalued options" and "selling overvalued options" are not sufficient strategies.** "Value" is a subjective determination that every option trader must make individually. Option traders should focus more on their three-part forecast than the estimated "value" of an option.

  

**8. "Selling options" is not a better strategy than "buying options."** It is a myth that 80% to 90% of options expire worthless. Only one-third of options, or approximately 33%, expire worthless. 10% to 15% of options are exercised, and the rest are closed prior to expiration.

  

**9. Trading means buying and selling.** It does not mean buying and holding. The goal of trading is make a net profit after a series of trades. It is, therefore, essential to accept some losses and to look forward without chastising oneself for making mistakes.

  

**10. Trading options is learned by developing a market forecasting technique, by starting small, by realizing profits and losses, and by working at a steady pace.** Traders should be able to explain their trade-selection process in a few sentences. Beginners should enter trades that have only "small" potential profits or losses, because this will increase the chances that objectivity can be maintained. Trades must be initiated and closed so that a "trading rhythm" is developed. Most people can learn to trade if they spend a few hours every week developing their technique.

  

Happy Holidays. May you have every success in 2014, investing and otherwise.

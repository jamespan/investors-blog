**Riverbed Technologies** ([RVBD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RVBD)), the No. 4-ranked company in the IBD 50 Index, looks to be shaping a fairly strong base that's worth watching. For the past four months shares of RVBD have managed to reset its base count as part of a corrective move and is now in a high-level double-bottom pattern. 

  

The second pivot low failed to undercut the first pattern low by a couple percent and could be reason to see the base as slightly flawed. However a break below 200-day simple moving average support and subsequent rally back through the key long-term moving average in developing the pivot might be considered an equalizer of sorts in flushing out the proverbial weak hand. 

  

Currently, shares are trading just above the base's mid pivot of 39.81 and establishing a fourth day of mostly tighter and lateral consolidating. I'd personally say the bulls are "handling" things well, but others might disagree on the technical situation. 

  

In the option market, the collective vote appears to favor bulls, but the strength of those bets is somewhat unclear. Riverbed's put/call ratio is showing a fair bit of determination in the calls as those type bets outpace put activity by a 4-to-1 margin. But with implieds under modest pressure and mostly fair pricing in relation to recent trading statistical range values, who's doing what to whom is open to suggestion as far as order flow is concerned. 

  

In this type situation, traders could be purchasing calls naked long or just as easily establishing much more moderately bullish positions such as rolls or buywrites. As the bulk of the action today has been in July's in-the-money 37 and 39 strike calls totaling about 2,000 contracts and an equal amount of the July 40s trading. This only makes those type possibilities more approachable. However, making absolute sense or cents of it all is best left to those areas of gray that permeate the market.

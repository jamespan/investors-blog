Suppose you're unsure as to whether the S&P 500 is facing a continuation lower from a bear flag or perhaps more optimistically, a reversal higher from a double bottom. While uncertain as to future direction you're confident the price action is unlikely to stick near current levels and implied volatility looks juiced enough to consider a volatility sale. One strategy, which might be considered given these variables is a short calendar or time spread. 

  

The short calendar sells a back-month contract with higher vega or volatility risk, while purchasing a closer in month of the same strike. As the other side of a long calendar, one might consider that the position has limited risks, but that's not entirely correct. By holding overall short vega, there is always the risk of the back month expanding relative to the front-long contract. Because of this characteristic, there is an "open risk" element to it where losses could be larger than expected if future implieds between the two contracts skew unfavorably, as well as if underlying stock fails to move as expected.

  

  

Back to a product such as the S&P 500, a good deal of the potential skew risk is reduced as pending earnings, FDA announcements and the likes are all but eliminated, thus making for more sure-footed and steady skews between calendar months when looking to bet on premiums falling. While we can't say for sure that's going to happen anytime soon, we like the fear that's being placed into implieds, but levels, which have also failed to make a fresh relative high. In conjunction with our belief bulls or bears will soon look to solidify the S&P 500's price chart with either a double bottom or bear flag follow-through, a short calendar like the three lot November / October 113 call spread illustrated above, looks all the more interesting.

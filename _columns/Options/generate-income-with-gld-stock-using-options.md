Gold investing can be done on the stock market via the Spdr Gold Shares ETF ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)), which aims to match the performance of the price of gold bullion. GLD stock is holding support at several key moving averages as it sits about 8% off its high




GLD stock is down around 5.5% year to date. Unfortunately for income investors, the exchange traded fund does not pay a dividend.


As sophisticated investors, we can generate income from holding GLD stock using options. The strategy is a covered call that involves selling call options against a stock position.


GLD Stock: Covered Call
-----------------------


Let's look at how a covered call trade on GLD stock might look.


Buying 100 shares of GLD stock would cost around $16,875.


A March 170 strike call option was trading Wednesday around $3.75, generating $375 in premium income per contract.


Selling the call option generates an income of 2.27% in just under three months, equaling around 10.64% annualized.



If GLD stock closes above 170 on the expiration date, the shares will be called away at 170, leaving the trader with a total profit of $500 (gain on the shares plus the $375 option premium received).


That equates to a 3.03% return, which is 14.18% on an annualized basis.


Of course, the risk with the trade is that the GLD stock might drop, which could wipe out any gains made from selling the call.


Investors looking to increase their income can use covered calls and [cash secured puts](https://www.investors.com/research/options/finding-yield-with-a-cash-secured-put-on-pfizer-stock-annualized-return-could-top-18/) on high dividend stocks.


For example, the [covered call idea](https://www.investors.com/research/options/abbvie-stock-pounded-how-to-make-15-percent-annualized-return-with-covered-call/) on **Medical Properties Trust** ([MPW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MPW)) is working well so far. Gold investors could also potentially buy the GLD ETF for a discount using a cash secured put strategy similar to [this idea](https://www.investors.com/research/options/option-trading-how-to-buy-this-ibd-big-cap-20-stock-for-a-10-discount/).


Generating Income
-----------------


Gold investing can provide a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks, but the returns can be unattractive for income investors without a dividend payment. Thankfully, you now know how to generate an income from your GLD stock investments!


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

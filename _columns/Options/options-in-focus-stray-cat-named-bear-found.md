Wednesday turned out to be a bit of a potential game changer for bullish investors as the market rode into the close with gains and strong volume, thus shifting back into an uptrend.

  

Not all bulls are created equal though. Some fail to do much before turning tail and often enough, recent champions can even get bulldozed technically as a new crop of leadership emerges. One technical stray in Wednesday's session was Dow component **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)). Shares finished down 4.62% after issuing mixed earnings results and disappointing outlook. 

  

In conjunction with a weekly technical picture which suggests an intact double top from April 2011 to February 2012 and more recent price action no longer "handling" things very well, traders looking for a leading candidate within the 25% to 30% realm of stocks that don't cooperate during healthier market climates, might look at CAT. 

  

For option traders, with ultra-tight penny increment spread markets in Caterpillar's call and put markets, if there's a name for a spread being considered, it can likely get filled without too much difficulty. Given CAT's failure near $110 and its 50-day simple moving average, the 110 strike might be one to consider for premium selling. 

  

Furthermore, given we're not open to holding unmitigated risk for just "okay" fair pricing based on statistical and implied range values, remembering to "buy to open" another contract for protection makes equally smart sense and cents. And if we were to assign a name to that kind of CAT or umm bear, we'd say it answers to the name "vertical."

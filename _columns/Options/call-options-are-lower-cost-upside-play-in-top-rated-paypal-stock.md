**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL))Â stock is a highly rated stock that is pulling back to test the rising 21-day moving average.




Yesterday, call buyers outpaced put buyers by a ratio of two to one which could be seen as a bullish sign.


PYPL stock is ranked No. 1 in its group with a best possible [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 86. Paypal is also sitting at No. 7 on the IBD Leaderboard.


Traders thinking the rally in PYPL stock will resume shortly can look at buying call options as a speculative play.


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase the underlying stock at a certain price (strike price), up until a certain date (expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage (this can be both a good and a bad thing).



Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares, they would have to invest around $23,150 at the current price. Instead, the investor could gain a similar exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option. One standard call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.


Call Options Can Be A Low Cost Way To Get Upside Exposure
---------------------------------------------------------


If an investor were to buy one PYPL 200 call option expiring in March 2021, they would only need to invest around $3,740 rather than $23,150. If PYPL stock goes to $0, the investor loses only $3,740 while still maintaining a similar exposure to the gains.


The PYPL 200 call option gives the investor the right to buy 100 PYPL shares at 200 up until the expiration date.


The call option costs around $37.40, so the investor would need PYPL stock to rise above 237.40 (strike price plus premium paid) in order for the trade to be profitable at expiration.


There is always a risk with trading on leverage like this and if the stock drops below 200 at expiration, the investor would lose 100% of the investment, which is the $3,740. An investor holding 100 shares on the other hand would lose around $3,150.


Savvy traders might consider reducing the cost of the long call by also selling an out-of-the-money call to make a bull call spread. This reduces the cost but also reduces the potential gain.


For example, the March 260 strike call can be sold for around $7.10 which would reduce the cost of the long call by $710, but would cap any gains above 260.


Long call options and bull call spreads can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock without risking as much capital as needed to buy the stock outright.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

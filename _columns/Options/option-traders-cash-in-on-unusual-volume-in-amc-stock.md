**AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)) jumped 95% yesterday. Call option buyers of meme stocks, like [AMC stock](https://www.investors.com/research/amc-entertainment-stock-buy-now/), were able to cash in on the massive movement throughout the day.




AMC Stock Option Sees Massive Trading Volume
--------------------------------------------


[AMC stock](https://www.investors.com/research/amc-entertainment-stock-buy-now/), along with other meme stocks such as **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)), **BlackBerry** ([BB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BB)) and **Bed Bath & Beyond** ([BBBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBBY)) saw massive call option volume yesterday.


The Reddit/WallStreetBets crowd have clearly targeted these meme stocks once again. The group has led retail traders in squeezing institutional investors out of their short trades.


Option volume went through the roof for AMC stock with over 4.5 million contracts traded compared to the 90-day average of 650,000. Of those, 60% were calls and 40% were puts.


AMC stock options were the most actively traded of any stock or ETF on the day.


The contract with the highest volume was the 73 strike calls with an expiration of June 4. They traded over 233,000 contracts and were up 2,462% on the day, bringing [jackpot-type winnings to some investors](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/amc-stock-five-investors-hit-billion-amc-stock-jackpot/).


WallStreetBets Targets Meme Stocks Again
----------------------------------------


BlackBerry stock was fourth on the total volume list with 1.4 million contracts traded. A much higher portion than AMC stock belonged to the call options at 1.2 million. The 90-day average for option contracts on BB stock is 162,000.


For BlackBerry, it was the June 4, 15 strike call with 136,000 contracts that had the most volume but the June 18, 43 strike call saw the biggest percentage gain at 1,450%.


Clearly, out-of-the-money calls are the flavor of the day for WallStreetBets traders.

Bed Bath and Beyond was much more sedate in comparison, with 282,000 contracts traded, but that is still much higher than the average 48,000. Sixty five percent of BBBY options were in calls.


BBBY saw 35,000 contracts traded in the June 4 calls at the 45 strike. Those calls were up 11,080% on the day. Truly amazing.


Huge Rewards But Don't Forget The Risks
---------------------------------------


What's clear is that some Reddit/WallStreetBets traders made a killing on [AMC stock](https://www.investors.com/research/amc-entertainment-stock-buy-now/), BB stock and BBBY stock call options yesterday.


It's not often you can catch moves like this, but when you do the rewards can be enormous. But don't forget about the risks. With AMC stock trading down as much as 10% from yesterday's close, that popular option contract is 73% off the peak price yesterday.

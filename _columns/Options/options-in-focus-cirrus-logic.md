Within the IBD 50, No. 4 ranked Cirrus Logic (CRUS) is atop the unusual option volume list. The specialized chip manufacturer is seeing a near 700% increase in activity above its 50-day average on more than 19,000 contracts in front of tonight's earnings release. Puts are finding favor over calls by a margin of 1.34-to-1.0. 

  

Implieds in the mid-90s for the at-the-money front month compares to underlying statistical volatility running from the high 40s to 50s. As much and with implied range prices during the past couple months getting as low as 50%, we can make the basic assumption a substantial volatility crush will follow tonight's report when its calls and puts reopen for trade tomorrow morning. Whether that matters of course will depend on who's positioning and how. 

  

Monday's late afternoon pricing estimates a 68% or 1SD chance shares will remain within 20.5% of their current levels near 29.50 through August expiration which has 17 days remaining. This compares to an evenly placed (and evenly traded 1,900 contracts) surrounding money August 31 call / 28 put straddle market of $3.50. Breakevens at expiration of 34.50 and 24.50 are 17% removed from the current share price.

  

The difference between the expected move estimate and straddle break-evens boils down to a couple things. First off and most simply, the latter is a simple buy and hold strategy into expiration. At that point, either the call or put will need to be worth the price of today's spread value and trading for all intents and purposes, like stock with only intrinsic premium attached to the one in-the-money contract. 

  

On the other hand, the expected move calculation is a good deal more theoretical. The percent measure of the stock's potential range through expiration factors in the concept of dynamic and continuous hedging of deltas and the impact of volatility risk and time decay in estimating its value.

  

  

In theory at least, the ability to hedge directional risk at certain and discreet intervals and the negative whammy's of pressured implieds and time decay which wipe away all extrinsic contract value over the life of the option, allow the upper positional hand to go to the contract seller. Shown above, that stance is represented by the trader short the strangle. But if real life deviates from the theoretical and shares of CRUS make for less continuous-looking stock hedges / scalps against the short strangle; any of today's edge is going to be replaced by tomorrow's prospect of the trader facing less theoretical risks and real world open losses.

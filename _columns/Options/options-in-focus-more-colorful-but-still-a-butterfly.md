What do you get when you sell an at-the-money straddle and buy a surrounding, out-of-the money strangle? The answer is you'll receive a credit for your effort. The other result, which happens to be the more important outcome with regards to risk, is you've put together a synthetic long butterfly also known as an iron butterfly. 

  

As a regular butterfly's maximum risk is defined by the premium paid, an iron butterfly using the same strikes must, due to arbitrage, must maintain the same risk. However, because a credit is generated the risk is figured out by subtracting that credit from the distance between the strikes rather than the debit associated with the classic butterfly. 

  

Why is this so? Another way to view the iron butterfly is as two at-the-money verticals, a bear call spread and a bull put spread which share the middle sold strike. Only in a perfect world where the underlying finds itself exactly at the middle strike at expiration will both spreads be worthless and the trader left to enjoy the credit as a profit received in full. 

  

At all other price levels that a stock might get pulled to and from, only one of the two verticals, which the trader has sold, will have intrinsic value. Come expiration, if shares are above or below of the purchased options (either call or put), the one spread will be intrinsically worth its maximum amount or the difference between the strikes. That's much to the detriment of the trader's iron butterfly as they'll be losing that amount and only able to offset the loss by the lesser initial premium taken in.

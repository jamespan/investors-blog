**Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)) has just gone on a monster rally from 90 to 120 in a matter of days. 




Volatility has also gone through the roof with the current level of 61% the highest reading since January. Shares started surging after the [July 27 earnings report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-advanced-micro-devices-clears-second-quarter-hurdles/).


Traders thinking that volatility might drop while prices stabilize could look at an iron condor.


When volatility is high, the iron condor can be placed further out of the money, giving the trade a decent chance at success. 


Let's look at an example using AMD stock. 


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. 


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction. 


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Sept. 17 expiry, we could sell the 95 put and buy the 90 put. That spread could be sold yesterday for around 55 cents. 


Then the bear call spread could be placed by selling the 140 call and buying the 145 call. This spread could be sold yesterday for around 70 cents. In total the iron condor will generate around $1.25 in premium.


AMD Stock Option Trade Potential Return 33%
-------------------------------------------


The profit zone ranges between 93.75 and 141.25. This can be calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received. 



Because both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 minus 1.25 x 100 = $375.


Therefore, if we take the premium ($125) and divided by the maximum risk ($375), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 33.33%. 


If price action stabilizes, then iron condors will work well. However, if AMD stock continues to bounce around, the trade will suffer losses. 


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $125 so could set a stop loss at 1.5 times the premium, or around $187. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

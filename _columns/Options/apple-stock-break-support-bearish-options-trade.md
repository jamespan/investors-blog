**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is at a crossroads. With a weak close on Friday, it's testing the bottom of a bearish wedge formation. A break of support could set Apple stock up for a bearish option trade.




Can Apple Stock Find Support?
-----------------------------


[Second quarter earnings for Apple stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-earnings-q2-2020-aapl-stock/) came in last week at $2.55 per share, meeting estimates. Revenue beat estimates of $54 billion coming in at $58.3 billion. Growth was in the low single digits for both metrics compared to the same quarter a year ago.


If the weakness from Friday spills over into this week, here's a strategy that has multiple ways to profit. It's called a bearish call spread. If Apple stock declines, remains flat or rises by less than 10.8% over the course of the next seven weeks, it comes out a winner.


Bear Call Spread Option Trade
-----------------------------


For Apple stock, a bear call spread could use the 320 strike as the short call and the 330 strike as the long call. As of Friday's close, this trade offered a 64.9% return on risk when using the June 19 expiration. The maximum profit on the trade would be $195 per contract with a maximum risk of $305.


The spread achieves maximum profit if Apple stock closes below 320 on June 19. In that case, the entire spread expires worthless and as a premium seller, you keep the $195 option premium.


The maximum loss occurs if Apple stock closes above 330 on June 19. There, you would lose $305 per contract.


You've probably heard the warnings that selling options risks unlimited losses. But aÂ bear call spread is a defined-risk strategy and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance. If Apple stock went as high as 400 or beyond, the most you will lose is still just 305.

The break-even point for this bear call spread is $321.95. That's calculated using the 320 strike of the short call plus the 1.95 option premium per contract.


Keep in mind that due to the bid-ask spread, you may not be able to get filled at these prices.


Watch Apple Stock For Stop Loss Triggers
----------------------------------------


For a trade like this, you could set a stop loss at 30% of capital at risk, or around $90 per option contract. Or you could use the action in the underlying Apple stock. If it breaks above 300, its moving against your expectation. You could consider closing the trade early to avoid a large loss.


Making a bearish trade on a strong stock like Apple is risky so you need the right setup. Apple currently has a Composite Rating of 91 and Relative Strength Rating of 93. But, if the price of Apple stock breaks below the bearish wedge formation at around 285, it looks like the direction is down.


Bullish traders may prefer to try a [bull put spread like the Netflix stock example](https://www.investors.com/research/options/netflix-stock-bullish-option-trade/) mentioned last week in this column.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

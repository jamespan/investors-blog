Top ranked CANSLIM Select constituent, IT and business consulting outfit and soon to be S&P 500 component **Accenture** ([ACN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ACN)) enjoyed a nice weekly chart breakout from a base-on-base pattern Tuesday. 

  

Word from Standard & Poors of Accenture’s inclusion into their benchmark index resulted in volume surging nearly 700% above average to around 29.5 million with regular bulls playing the name technically and / or fundamentally and assisted greatly by index funds simply needing to buy shares due to the pending change. 

  

On the option side, calls were favored by a margin of roughly 1.5-to-1.0 on total volume of about 15,000 contracts and roughly 250% above normal. Most active, traders honed in on the surrounding money July 57.50 and 62.50 calls on similar volume of 1,700 and 1,900 contracts, while the at-the-money 60s saw a more modest 750 change hands. 

  

With decent open interest in both strikes, a volatile session and mostly flat implieds not yielding any special clues, it’s somewhat difficult to discern what, if any, trader preferences there may have been on the day. In saying that, buy-writes are known to be favored amongst many institutions. Thus, with today’s announcement we might surmise this kind of mildly bullish premium collection strategy could have been a favored play by customers.  

  

One month out in the August contract, the out-of-the money 55 and at-the-money 60 put shared similar levels of trading at 1,850 and 1,450 contracts apiece. However, with open interest negligible in the 60s, traders rolling up protection against existing long stock or even those somewhat unorthodox “targeted buyers” also known as naked put sellers may have been behind that volume.

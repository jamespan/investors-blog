"Day Three" of the market's rally attempt proved a good one but a day shy of the typical "coast is clear" signal to pull cash out from under the mattress and reallocate it into leading stocks. Oh yeah, there's also the problem of virtually no leading stocks breaking out or even working on constructive-looking bases. 

  

For option traders and bulls interested in buying deep pullbacks, which might represent deep value as well, there is of course, plenty to do. But with volatility the way it currently is and where literally one five-minute candlestick might make you wish you hadn't pulled the trigger; a collar position might be considered particularly attractive.

  

The collar is comprised of equal parts long stock, a protective and typically out-of-the-money put to limit one's losses should shares move lower and a call sold at a strike above the current market price to help finance all or part of the cost of the put. The strategy has the same risk characteristics as a vertical. As much, besides covering one's you know what when wrong, it does also limit profitability on the upside in the event the stock rallies. 

  

Despite that latter unwanted characteristic, growth stock traders might still want to consider the merits of the collar. When traded actively the position can actually thrive during times of strong volatility. Ultimately, big price swings can lead to potential adjustments in the calls, puts, as well as stock as shares move through strike and afford some "dynamic" results in the process.

  

Executed in this manner and of course with a little bit of favor from the stock, traders using the collar can accumulate on weakness, maintain defined risk exposure on the downside, take profits on the upside / reduce risk while continuing to keep some type of upside exposure if the trader so chooses.

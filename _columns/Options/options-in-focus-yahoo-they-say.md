  Options In Focus: "Yahoo! They Say?"

I came across some market commentary on Friday regarding a large spread in **Yahoo** ([YHOO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=YHOO)), which reminded me how people can see the same thing, interpret the action differently, and yet somehow still reach the same conclusion. 

  

The trade in question involved a bearish risk reversal tied to shares of YHOO. Specifically, a credit of $1.53 was generated using a purchased out-of-the money December 12 put and sold December 14 call on 16,000 contracts. The analyst went on to say the trader established this position against 1.6 million shares of YHOO stock at $15.03. 

  

Next, it was explained the risk of this three-way spread amounted to the trader having an in-the-money buy-write while maintaining protection from the purchased put. So, what's the big deal? In truth, not a whole lot but in a world that could use less complication, I'd say this analyst isn't helping matters. 

  

In our mind, with purchased long stock obviously the core of this position, we see presenting that bullish component of this investment equation as the piece, which should rightfully come first in describing the strategy. 

  

Secondly, when a position is comprised of stock and options, our favored next step in this less puzzling puzzle is to ask what synthetic positions can be formed? Here, buying a one-to-one ratio of long stock and long puts amounts to buying a synthetic long call. In this case, the synthetic long call is on the December 12 strike. 

  

What else do we have to look at? The sale of the higher strike 14 call means in total the trader has effectively purchased the December 12 call and sold the same month 14 call, resulting in a two point wide bull call vertical and one which happens to be in the money by just more than a point at the time. 

  

In realizing one has on a synthetic vertical, the use of the formula: Put + Stock â€” Strike = Synthetic Long Call can then be figured out. From there, the trader can easily subtract the premium of the sold call to come up with that strategy's limited risk, limited reward profile and one which makes better sense to us; albeit the same "cents" where it counts most, even amongst somewhat disagreeing analysts.

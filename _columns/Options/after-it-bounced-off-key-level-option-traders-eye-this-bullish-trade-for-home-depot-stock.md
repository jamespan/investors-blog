**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) showed impressive strength on Friday and closed near the high of the day. Home Depot stock also recently bounced off the 200-day moving average. 




The company is ranked No. 6 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 88 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 89. 


Investors who think Home Depot stock will stay above the 200-day moving average for the next week or two could look at a short-term bull put spread.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. 


Selling the February-expiring 345-strike put and buying the 340 put would create a bull put spread. 


This spread was trading on Friday for around $0.75. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $75 in option premium for a block of 100 shares and would have a maximum risk of $425. 


Potential Of 17% Return In Three Weeks
--------------------------------------


That represents a 17% return on risk between now and Feb. 18 if HD stock remains above 345. 



If Home Depot stock closes below 340 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $425. 


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 344.25, which is calculated as 345 less the 0.75 option premium per contract. 


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 4, which means it is a similar exposure to owning four shares of Home Depot, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves. 


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $0.75 to $1.50, I would consider closing early for a loss.


With earnings due Feb. 22, this trade should have no earnings risk unless Home Depot gives early guidance. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

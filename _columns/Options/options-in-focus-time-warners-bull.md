What do back-to-back block prints of 25,000 and 15,000 mean in **Time Warner** ([TWX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWX))? Without carnal knowledge of the person(s) doing the positioning, one can't be absolutely certain. 

  

More pragmatically, with that activity home to the February 34 call, the contract put up for $0.56, open interest at 263 and shares of TWX at 33.30 and less than 2% to 3% removed from what looks like a massive symmetrical "Tyangle", I'd wager we're looking at an opening buyer that's laid down $2,240,000 for a bullish position. 

  

Implieds have slowly crept up on the session to about 23%, reinforcing the idea of a buyer hard at work. The position itself, if we're correct, is also already profitable by $0.15 with just more than an hour to go in the session with the call now priced at $0.71 per contract. 

  

Assistance in growing the call's current value is mostly the result of the trader having timed the purchase near session lows and a few pennies below last night's closing price. With the contract's starting delta of 37 and now slightly higher 40 delta; the increase of about $0.30 in TWX shares has in return, allowed the delta to increase the contract's value by roughly $0.11 to $0.12 of the $0.15 profit. The rest of today's paper profit is the work of vega or the volatility component. 

  

So, what's a trader to do now as they are staring a profit in excess of 25% in the face? In this strategist's view, there's likely little to do just yet. That of course is entirely up to the individual and their risk preferences. 

  

In our own discussions on risk often talked about on these pages, we often refer to a contract's "price to double" as a consideration. The truth however, is if you're simply going to buy premium and hold for a double or let it evaporate; well, that's not a great plan of attack. 

  

Nonetheless, when seeing the dollar signs being committed and an apparent axe to grind, 43 calendar days until expiration and the fact shares are still well-positioned in relation to the described pattern; I'd say this bull is likely happy thus far, but content to sit with a plan in mind but not yet acted upon.

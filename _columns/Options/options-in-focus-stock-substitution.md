The trend, so they tell us, is our friend. But when conditions permit, a more reliable ally for bulls (or bears) are options that look to be a stronger fit for positioning than holding shares of a particular holding. And as far as that bit of advice goes, one better-suited way to ride a stock long can be with a stock substitution strategy.

  

A stock substitution strategy is a fancy way of saying you've done the hard work of accruing profits, maybe over the past three or four sessions for instance, and are now looking to lock in those returns with an absolute guarantee not subject to any pesky and unwanted price gaps. 

  

When option premiums are affordable, as they mostly are these days, stock substitution for bulls can simply mean selling out shares and putting a percentage of those winnings into a certain amount of long calls. 

  

As the strategy typically employs "at" or "out-of-the money" options at initiation, gains will likely trail results if we simply held stock on the initial move. But if shares continue to rally above the purchased strike, we could wind up a bigger winner than we would otherwise. 

  

This profit phenomenon is sometimes possible despite less capital being put to work due to an option's leverage. Leverage, particularly with at and out-of-money options and when premiums are affordable / cheap, can allow for greater contract sizing relative to shares. In that type situation and if a favorably nice upside move in the underlying were to occur; the result is the implemented call or stock substitution position, can wind up beating the profits of the stockholder. 

  

  

To illustrate this principle, we'll use NASDAQ 100 component Altera Corp (ALTR). Shares broke out from a fairly nice cup-shaped base with handle back in early July as the market signaled a follow-through day. Admittedly, I saw as flawed at the time but all the more reason to use a protective call rather than stock. 

  

In saying that, let's suppose a trader purchased 300 shares and continued to hold the position over the next few sessions. With ALTR up two points from the breakout, the trader looking at a stock substitution strategy has net profits of $600 with which to work but is only willing to sacrifice 50% of those gains. 

  

Checking the board and one idea which kept slightly more than $300 of the trader's profits and which could ultimately outperform holding long stock were +4 August 30 calls priced for about $0.70 per contract. 

  

Truthfully, the upside outperformance of this call position with under 40 days to go, isn't likely to occur, so this may not be the most endearing illustration for an optimistic bull to compromise their long stock holding with. But after a nice solid run in shares and in appreciating how managing traditional stops with long stock can at times be a bit trickier than plannedâ€”a stock substitution makes both sense and "cents" to consider. *This tweaked archived piece appeared originally on July 13.*

CROX stock is ranked No. 1 in the latest [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks. It's no surprise when you look at the price action in **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) over the last few months.




CROX stock hasn't pulled back much during its uptrend with consistent support at the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/).


As you would expect, CROX stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 95. The only slight concern is the [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of only 75, although the company has delivered two straight quarters of strong earnings growth.


CROX Stock: Bullish Calendar Spread
-----------------------------------


Traders looking to cash in on the rising price of CROX stock could look at a bullish calendar spread.


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


With shares of Crocs trading around 54, a bullish calendar spread might be placed at 65.


Selling the Nov. 20 65 call option will generate around $70 in premium, and buying the Dec. 18 65 call will cost around $1.60.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $90 per spread and that is the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is around $340, but that can vary depending on changes in implied volatility.



The idea with the trade is that if CROX stock trades up to around 65, the calendar spread will increase, resulting in a net profit.


A bullish calendar spread is a good way to gain some upside exposure on a stock without risking too much if the move doesn't eventuate.


The ideal scenario is a rise up to 65 around Nov. 20 with very little change in implied volatility.


**AMD Stock On The Radar**
--------------------------


Another stock on my radar is **Advanced Micro Devices** ([AMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMD)). Price action is currently quite weak, but the stock is still ranked No. 4 in the latest IBD 50.



I would love to sell some cash-secured puts on AMD stock but will wait to see if the stock comes a bit lower first.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is not only trading above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) and the [50-day line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/), but it has also experienced a powerful breakout past a 505.48 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in the last few days. Traders willing to bet that NVDA stock will stay above 510 for the next week or so could look at a bull put spread trade.




As a reminder, a bull put spread is a defined risk strategy, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


This type of trade will profit if the [full-size position on IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) trades sideways or higher — and even sometimes if it trades slightly lower.


**NVDA Stock Today: The Bull Put Spread Setup**
-----------------------------------------------



NVDA stock traded around 549 during Thursday afternoon trading. So, if we use the Jan. 19 expiration, we can sell a put contract with a 510 strike price. Then, we can buy a 505 put for a net premium received of $0.40 per share for a set of contracts, based on recent trading.


Selling this spread would put $40 in a trader's pocket right now. Also, the trade has a maximum risk of $460.


If the spread expires worthless that would be an 8.7% return in 10 days, provided NVDA stock stays above 510 at expiration.

**Risk Vs. Reward**
-------------------


The maximum loss would occur if NVDA stock closes below 505 on Jan. 19. At that point, the premium seller would lose $460 on the trade. 


The break-even point for the trade? We get 509.60, calculated by taking 510 less the $0.40 option premium per contract.


I would set a stop-loss if the loss is equal to the amount of premium received, which in this case would be $40.


Sticking to this stop loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.

With about 45 minutes to go, the **NASDAQ 100** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) has gone from a session-long position of relative strength to a slightly weaker situation which has the tech-heavy index narrowly cutting through its first hour lows. The good news for bulls open to bargain-hunting is daily chart support has remained intact to establish a double bottom, while flushing out the S&P 500's similar but possibly begging to be hit pattern as it lined up with the closely watched 1100 level. 

  

The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX is a bit of wildcard for this strategist as it relates to fast operating bulls wishing to see Tuesday's lows as a technical line in the sand i.e. stop loss, for any bargain-hunting endeavors. For one, today's highs near 47% still managed to miss the August panic highs of 48%. Secondly and due to the elevated readings in the VIX of recent weeks, the gauge also narrowly missed stretching to a short-term extreme of 15% or more above its 10-day simple moving average with a result of roughly 13.50%. 

  

Is this a case of the price action being good enough for bargain-hunters and who might appreciate that perfection isn't necessarily all that it's cracked up to be when it comes to the market? Given the historically elevated readings in the VIX and near 9% drop in the broader market for the five day period, we certainly can't blame faster money types for trying to play, particularly so if they make good use of a limited risk spread strategy and keep to the fore-mentioned mercy point. 

  

For bears that've cared of late, we're a bit more confident and pragmatic Tuesday's price action is very much "good enough" for adjusting or exiting any short deltas which may have provided some decent coin during the market's downturn. While we still have our longer-term sights set on the 50% retracement area and the 1000 level in the S&P 500, the evidence is enough to respect the power of a bear market rally as a much more neutral option hedge hog.

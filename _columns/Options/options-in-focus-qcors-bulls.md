IBD 50 constituent **Questcor Pharmaceuticals**  ([QCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOR)), ranked No. 1 ranked "Small-Cap Leaders" from IBD's Screen Of The Day, enjoyed a bit of nice follow-through confirmation Friday and one which option traders look to be sympathetic too. 

  

On the heels of Wednesday's volatile earnings reaction after issuing a top and bottom-line beat, shares have gained more than 10% in two sessions. Technically, the strong push higher puts QCOR shares near prior highs within a corrective cup-shaped base of 28% depth nearly six months in-the-making and one, which found support off an October base breakout to fresh all-time-highs. 

  

With shares finishing up 2.9% at 44.70 Friday, more than 5,000 contracts traded compared to its daily average of about 750. Calls received the lion's share of the volume in outpacing the puts by a 2.5-to-1.0 margin, though the top two trades of the day were the June 47 call and June 41 put with similar sizing and out-of-the-money positioning relative to shares at 44.70. 

  

Given near equal volume just north of 1,000 contracts and no open interest to speak of, our initial thought was of a trader buying a strangle given the low implied volatility in QCOR or of a bull using the options to design either a collar or risk reversal. After some quick print digging, it turns out the bulk of the volume in each contract was the result of one, but likely different individuals, given 1,000 calls traded for $1.10 in the morning and 871 puts for $1.40 near the closing bell. 

  

What does that mean? While we can't say definitively, it does appear a couple traders could have a potentially nice leg up on the competition, but are working at QCOR from very different technical, as well as risk and reward angles. In the end though, a call buyer or buy-write position could always be the work of a short-call operator. Likewise, a put or targeted purchase strategist or married put position could be the effort of a bear simply buying a naked long put.

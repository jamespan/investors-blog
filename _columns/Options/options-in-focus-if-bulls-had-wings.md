Following last week’s massive market rally and Friday’s full-blown complacency signal in the CBOE Volatility Index (prices dropped more than 15% below the VIX’s 10-day simple moving average), the broader averages seemingly unwilling to go lower Tuesday. So the question might be "Do bulls or umm, Buffalo's have wings?" The answer for ticker "BWLD" is "yes, they do."

  

**Buffalo Wild Wings** ([BWLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BWLD)) shares are up 2.25% intraday and breaking out to higher ground from a short consolidation pattern, which followed a base-on-base, cup-shaped breakout about two weeks ago. With tasty hot and fresh all-time highs being gobbled up by some bulls in the somewhat thinly traded issue, one side helping which might be considered before it proves potentially costly otherwise, is the use of a limited risk option strategy.

  

Checking the boards and despite average stock volume in the neighborhood of 250,000; Buffalo Wings quoted call and put markets are fairly reasonable with most $0.10 to $0.20 wide between the bid and asking price. While more complex three or four legged spreads are unlikely to get filled for anything close to a reasonable price; outrights, verticals and calendars are all spreads, which might allow for an execution.

  

For intermediate stock bulls, the purchase of a protective put in conjunction with shares allows the trader to have his or her risk pre-defined to an absolute amount during the life of the contract, while maintaining upside profit exposure. Given the strong possibility for a bit of technical indigestion in the broader market following its strongest price run since 2009 and one defined by complacent behavior, I’d say looking at that kind of options menu makes added sense and cents.

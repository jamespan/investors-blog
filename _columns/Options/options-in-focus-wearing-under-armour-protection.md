How are investors handling **Under Armour**'s ([UA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UA)) better-than-expected and well-received corporate results? I guess that depends on when traders suited up, as well as the timing of their offensive and defensive positioning. 

  

On the option side and for a less-than-crowded trade, the few that suited up as long premium buyers wishing for either a Hail Mary or a disappointing fumble. But Tuesday's action has failed to produce either event when examining a volatility spread like Monday's ATM November 75 / 77.5 strangle. 

  

Priced yesterday for $7.55 on mid 50s implieds, the spread did expand in value, theoretically at least, during Tuesday's first half. Despite only sporadic participation we know this to be true as the call contract did trade up to $7.50 at session highs and just five cents short of the spread's entire value. 

  

At the same time, with a contract low in the put at $1.35, we can make a reasonable guesstimate the spread could have traded for about $9 and maybe even more had spectators become active players. Thus, some forward motion, hypothetically speaking, into the P&L, was there during the first half of play.

  

Late Tuesday with UA near 79.75, any would-be strangle holders have lost a bit of ground with the spread now trading at $7.20 and implieds dropping a couple percent into the high 40s to low 50s. Overall, the loss of about 5% in the strangle is mild, given the surrounding circumstances.

  

Bottom line, the combination of shares moving through one of the two strikes has been a benefit for the strangle but the price swing higher hasn't proven large enough to prevent a rather meager but easy-to-eyeball dip in implieds from pressuring the overall premium into a loss. And as today's game nears its conclusion, while wearing this kind of Under Armour protection is likely a bit of a letdown, this type of premium bull is a lot better off than if the offensive and defensive lines were still lined up at last night's closing line of scrimmage.

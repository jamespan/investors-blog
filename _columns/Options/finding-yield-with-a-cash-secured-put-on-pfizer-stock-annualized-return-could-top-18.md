**Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) is ranked No. 1 in the ethical drugs industry group and is showing a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 82 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96. 




Pfizer stock overtook its [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/apple-stock-set-up-proper-buy-point-before-big-rally/) at 51.96 out of a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/corner-cup-without-handle/) in late November. Shares have bounded into and out of their buy zone ever since, but showed remarkable strength Wednesday, closing 5.9% higher. 


Today, we're looking at how to sell a cash secured put on Pfizer stock. 


A cash-secured put is a slightly less bullish trade than buying the stock. It is considered a neutral to slightly bullish trade. 


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium or be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price. 


A Strategy For Beginners
------------------------


Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start with options. They are like a covered call and are pretty easy to understand once you know the basics. 


Traders selling puts should understand that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price. 



With PFE stock trading at 58.80 Wednesday, investors could sell a March put with a strike price of 55 for around $2.40. 


An investor selling this put would receive $240 into their account, which would be theirs to keep. If Pfizer stock falls below 55 by March 18, they would be required to buy 100 shares at 55 each. The effective net cost of the position would be 52.60, thanks to the option premium received. 


That is 10.54% below Wednesday's 58.80 closing price. 


4.56% Potential Return on Pfizer Stock Option
---------------------------------------------


If the stock stays above 55 at expiry, the put expires worthless, leaving the trader with a 4.56% return on capital at risk. That works out to be 18.1% annualized. 


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls quickly, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the premium received will help to offset the loss. 


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if PFE fell to $0, which would see the trade lose $5,260, but most traders would cut losses long before then.  


With PFE set to report earnings in early February, this trade would have earnings risk if held to expiration. 


Cash-secured puts are a great way to generate a return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership. 


If the put does get assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base and can potentially begin selling covered calls to generate additional income from the position. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

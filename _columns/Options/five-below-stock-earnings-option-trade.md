Retail has been a mixed bag so far in 2019. Some higher-end names like **Ulta Beauty** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) enjoyed some nice gains amid strong earnings and guidance. But some of the discount retailers should not go unnoticed. Five Below stock is one of the leaders and has moved sharply higher over the past couple of years. Anchored by strong earning and sales growth, **Five Below** ([FIVE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FIVE)) has one of the best longer term charts in the space.




Five Below stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's discount-retail/variety group, helped by a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 94. It's also been a mainstay in the [IBD 50](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) index of leading growth stocks, thanks to its excellent fundamentals and leading price performance.


Five Below stock corrected in the past month from an overbought condition. It's currently trading below the 10-week moving average ahead of its March 27 earnings report after the close. According to Zacks, quarterly profit is expected to rise 33% to $1.57 a share, with sales up 19% to $601.72 million.


Five Below Stock: Does A Call Option Make Sense?
------------------------------------------------


After the modest pullback, the stock sits just below a 133.75 entry.Â That buy point adds 10 cents to Five Below's Feb. 12 intraday high.


Option prices can be expensive headed into earnings, especially for a volatile name like Five Below. The market expects a move around 11 points (up or down) post earnings. That's about 9.4% of the current stock price. Since Five Below is about 14% below the 133.75 entry, it won't take much more than the expected market move to get Five Below above that level.



An aggressive options play ahead of earnings could pay off nicely.


A May monthly 120 strike call option currently sells for about $6.60 per contract. This option costs less than 6% of the Five Below stock price. It could easily be in profit mode with the market's expected move. If the stock hits all-time highs, the option could really explode higher.


The $6.60 price for a call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation to buy 100 shares of Five Below stock at 120, and costs only $660 per contract. This equates to just a bit less than one-twentieth the cost of 100 shares of the stock outright. The most you can lose on this trade is $660 for one contract. It limits the risk but allows for a lot of participation on the upside.

Just over a month ago the merits of the collar strategy with **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) was penned in this nightly column. For growth strategists that could appreciate accumulating shares on market weakness and also embraced managing risk during what might seem like the best of times, a collar seemed to make appreciable sense. 

  

Fast forward to Thursday's warning fallout, shares down nearly 19% on the session and an even rougher -30% thereabouts from our discussion of how NFLX's underlying stock volatility and option liquidity made it a strong collar candidate; those traders still so willing to accumulate on weakness are in a much more secure position to do so than their naked long counterparts maybe still looking to "Buy, Buy, Buy!" if they've got the resources to do so. 

  

With Netflix's business model and growth outlook called into question today and many traders obviously caught off guard and willing to do more than just listen idly to this latest and not-so-greatest news flash, should a collar trader just call it a day rather than attempt to accumulate shares? Despite what would typically be a nice percentage (gift) drop to begin one's bargain-hunting proclivities, there's nothing wrong with using the option of just simply exiting. 

  

In the end, a small limited loss for the collar trader doesn't need to be opened up to even greater risk by selling the protective long put(s) for a profit and using the proceeds to accumulate and re-hedge an even larger collar.

  

Theoretically and realistically if the trader's bullish opinion remains intact, then today's plunge is an opportunity to increase the collar position size by 20% to 30% given the magnitude of the 30% drop since our own August 12 piece was broadcast. But in that other sometimes yielding end known as changing opinion, simply appreciating the collar as having served one well as a synthetic bull call spread and using some of that larger-than-otherwise, preserved capital somewhere else can't be faulted.

It wouldn't surprise us if you missed entering into **Intel**'s ([INTC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INTC)) double-bottom base back in mid-October. In our own estimation, the pattern was a slightly flawed looking base, which sported a rather ill-formed and deep handle. Further, on the actual breakout, volume was lower-than-average volume as shares pushed through its mid pivot of 23.49 on October 14.

  

Shares are now a bit more than 8% above that buy point entry and technically extended according to some views. But with INTC sporting healthier volume characteristics over the past month and shares managing to put together a constructive-looking high handle which broke out today on higher and above-average volume after finding support off its cup-like or double-bottom highs, who's to say what's "extended or proper" anyways? 

  

Not us for one. But in those sometimes accurate heat-seeking option markets, well, truth be told, we're not too sure which side traders are taking. For one, Intel's very flat put / call ratio of 1.10 tells us that investors didn't really favor one contract type over the other. Further, trending lower but far from suggestive implied readings doesn't really help us with having a definitive grasp on whether buyers of contracts or net sellers were in control of the order flow. 

  

Finally, mostly much heavier open interest in Tuesday's most active strikes and contract volume exploding due to a likely expiration-related assist of 300,000 total calls and puts trading. Our job of sleuthing has become a good deal less authoritative than usual. The day's most unusual volume isn't helping matters, though admittedly we haven't done all the prerequisite fact-finding in locating prints. 

  

The adjacent and surrounding money April 26 and 25 puts saw volume of 22,000 and 28,000 respectively today compared to open interest of 2,300 and 28,600 respectively. Was it a roll? Was it a vertical? Was it even related? And which, if any side may the so-called smart money have taken? We don't have the answer, do you?

The Indian stock market has been performing well recently and are looking promising from a technical perspective.


Today, I'm looking at the iShares MSCI India ETF ([INDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INDA)) for a bullish option trade.


INDA is trading above the 20- and 50-day moving averages and I like this ETF as long at it continues to hold above the 20-day average.


The Indian economy also provides a favorable fundamental backdrop with an expanding middle class and a determined workforce.


Last week I opened a September bull put spread by selling the 29 strike puts and buying the 24 strike puts.


I sold this spread for 91 cents, which generates $91 in option premium per contract. The maximum risk on the trade is $409 per contract.


This trade will return 22.25% provided INDA stays above 29 between now and September.


The maximum loss on the trade will occur is INDA drops below 24, in which case the trade will lose $409 per contract.


Stop-Loss Levels
----------------


Looking at the chart, I would look to minimize losses if INDA break below the 20-day moving average, currently around 28.90.


Sticking to this stop-loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.

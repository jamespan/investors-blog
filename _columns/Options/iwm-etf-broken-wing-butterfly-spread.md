The iShares Russell 2000 ([IWM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IWM)) ETF has been charging higher lately, rallying from 150 to 214 since late October.




IWM is now 14% above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and a massive 39% above the 200-day moving average.


While it would take a brave person to bet against small caps, today I want to look at an option trade idea that will profit if IWM rallies a little further, but not too much further.


The trade is called a broken wing butterfly.


A broken wing butterfly using calls is a trade that can be set up with zero risk on the downside and a nice profit zone on the upside.


The catch is that there is risk to the upside if IWM makes a big move higher. So this is a neutral to slightly bullish trade.



Very bullish traders would not enter this trade.


Let's look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on the IWM ETF.


Buy one February 19th 220 call at 4.41


Sell two February 19th 225 calls at 2.67


Buy one February 19th 235 call at 0.86


Notice that the lower strike call is five points away from the middle call and the upper call is 10 points away.


IWM ETF Broken Wing Butterfly Spread Has A Wide Profit Range
------------------------------------------------------------


This broken wing butterfly trade will generate $7 in premium. There is no loss potential on the downside, the worst that can happen is all the calls expire worthless and the trader gets to keep the $7 premium.


On the upside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the width between the first two strikes (5) multiplied by 100 and subtracting the premium received (7).


That gives us 5 x 100 - 7 = $493.


The maximum gain can be calculated as 5 x 100 + 7 = $507 although this would only ever be achieved if IWM expired right at 225.


The ideal scenario for the trade is that IWM stays just below 225 until expiration.


The risk on the trade is that IWM shoots significantly higher, particularly early in the trade. For that reason, bullish traders would prefer to look at a vertical spread or a straight long call.


For those with a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, a broken wing butterfly could be a nice way to trade small cap stocks.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 20%, or around $100.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

With less than 45 minutes remaining Tuesday, virtualization-based and cloud computing outfit **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) is staging a nice weekly chart breakout from a handle that's now testing its mid-pivot of 104.38 within a weekly chart seven-month corrective, double-bottom base.

  

Coupled with its "Best in Group" EPS and SMR Ratings, what's not to like about VMW from a bullish vantage point? Well, maybe it's today's above-average, but still less-than-compelling volume failing to truly confirm the breakout? Or maybe traders like me find a slump in the CBOE Volatility Index to five-year lows and intraday stretch / differential of 20% below its 10-day simple moving average to be a warning flag for fresh bullish initiations in the market? 

  

The good news is the option, pardon the pun, of participating in a breakout under such conditions might deserve a bit more consideration if traders look to VMW's calls and / or put markets for help. We wrote as much in the first hour of trade over at Optionetics today in our featured Trader's Radar piece with our attention directed towards VMW's April or July vertical markets for bullish positioning. 

  

While there are a host of variations on the vertical when one thinks about using either calls or puts, as well as dreaming about all the possibilities involving VMW's near and surrounding money strikes, limited and reduced risk are ubiquitous and qualities we find very attractive in today's market environment. Along with decent liquidity which makes the dream of a vertical a very real possibility for those so inclined, we can't but help to think it's also a good way to stay grounded rather than having one's head too far up in the clouds.

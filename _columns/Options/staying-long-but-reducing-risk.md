With most major market indexes below their 50-day moving averages and with IBD's Current Outlook of "Market in Correction," maybe now is the time to close some profitable stock positions and stay in cash until the dust settles.  
   
Or do you have a nagging feeling that since the market has sold off before in recent months, only to rally to new highs, maybe I should keep my winners?  
   
An options strategy known as the "Stock Replacement Strategy" enables a stockholder to reduce downside risk while keeping most of the upside exposure to the stock. But which call should you buy? And what are the risks? This article reviews a classic example of using call options to replace a stock position using a stock recently high-lighted in IBD's Big Picture column as an example.  
   
**Setting Up the Example**   
   
**Stratasys**  ([SSYS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SSYS)) was mentioned in The Big Picture column by Vincent Mao on Tuesday, August 27, after surging in big volume after Citigroup started coverage of the 3D printer with a buy rating.  
   
Suppose that you purchased SSYS at $45 in April, 2012, when it broke out from a long basing pattern. With the price now $104, you have a $61 unrealized profit. Further assume that you believe SSYS is a good long-term hold, but you are worried that it might fall dramatically in a potential September-October market correction. If this is your position, options can give you an opportunity to participate in the stock rally, if your bearish concern does not happen. However, if your fears of a stock price decline are realized, then your risk is reduced.  
   
**Replacing a Stock Position with a Call Option**  
   
The "stock replacement" strategy involves selling stock you own and buying one in-the-money call for each 100 shares sold. The call maintains the upside exposure in the stock.  
   
With SSYS trading at 104.00 at noon on Tuesday, August 27, the SSYS December 90 Call was offered at 21.00 per share. This call has a breakeven stock price of $111 (strike price of 90 + cost of the call of 21 = 111), which is $7.00 per share above the current stock price. Owning this call has maximum risk of $21 per share, while owning stock at $104 has substantially more risk. Also, this call participates dollar for dollar in any stock price rise above $111 if it is held until the expiration date in December.  
   
In addition to commissions, there are two costs of this strategy. First, taxes, if any, must be paid on the gain from the stock. Second, the call option in this example has a time premium of $7 per-share. The stock is sold at $104, and the call does not breakeven until $111. However, as noted above, the risk of owning the call is substantially lower.  
   
**Choosing an Expiration Month**  
   
Why the December expiration? Although there no right or wrong expiration date to choose when buying a call, in the case of SSYS, the next earnings report is estimated for mid-November, and this call expires after this release. Also, the December option expiration is comfortably after the September-October period of bearish concern. This allows time for the market to recover if the market declines as feared.  
   
**Summary**  
   
Selling a stock you currently own and replacing it with an in-the-money call accomplishes two goals. First, it allows you to "stay in" a stock, albeit at a cost equal to the time premium of the call plus taxes on the stock gain. Second, it reduces risk if the stock price falls dramatically.

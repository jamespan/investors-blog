How and why option prices change is a mystery to many options traders. This is the fifth article in a series that discusses the seemingly complex topic of options price behavior and the "Greeks." 

  

**Introduction**

  

The interest rate is one of six inputs to option pricing formulas. The other five inputs are stock price, strike price, time to expiration, dividends and volatility. The influence of the interest rate on option prices is, perhaps, the least understood of all the inputs. This article will start by defining Rho. Then two examples that show the impact of a change in the interest rate will be presented. Finally, the importance of the interest rate (or lack thereof) in making trading decisions will be discussed. 

  

**Rho Defined**

  

Rho is the estimated change in option price for a one percentage point change in the interest rate, assuming other factors remain constant. 

  

Exhibit 1 illustrates how a typical option pricing computer program takes six inputs and calculates the theoretical price of the call and put. The difference between columns 1, 2 and 3 is that the assumption about the interest rate, which rises from 1% to 2% and then to 5%. 

  

In Exhibit 1, the call rho of "+0.040" means that "an increase in the interest rate from 1% to 2% causes the price of the 90 Call to rise by 4 cents from 2.57 (column 1) to 2.61 (column 2)." The put rho of "-0.040" means that "an increase in the interest rate from 1% to 2% causes the price of the 90 Put to fall by 4 cents from 2.99 to 2.95." Thus, rho is stated in the same units (dollars and cents) as the option price. This is the same as vega and theta which are also stated in dollars and cents; but this is different than delta, which is stated in percentage terms. 

  

Now look at column 3 in Exhibit 1 in which the interest rate assumption is 5%. Since 5% is three percentage points higher than 2%, one would expect the price of the 90 Call in column 3 to be 12 cents higher than the price in column 2. And that is almost true. The price of the 90 Call in column 3 is 2.74, which is 13 cents than the price of 2.61 in column 2. The difference of one cent is due to rounding. 

  

Also in Exhibit 1 the price of the 90 Put in column 3, 2.95, is approximately 12 cents (or three times rho) lower than the price of 2.84 in column 2. Again, the difference of one cent between the estimated change and the actual change is due to rounding. 

  

Now look at Table 1, which illustrates rho and the impact of changing interest rates in a different way. Table 1 contains theoretical values and rhos of a hypothetical 100 Call and 100 Put at different stock prices and different days to expiration. The purpose of Table 1 is to illustrate some basic concepts of how rho changes as stock price and time to expiration change. The rows in Table 1 represent the stock prices, and the columns represent the number of days to expiration. 

  

The first concept that Table 1 reveals is that rho is a small number. In column1, row 3, in which the stock price is 100 and there are 90 days to expiration, the rho is approximately +11 cents for the 100 Call and -11 cents for the 100 Put. While 11 cents is approximately 2% of the option prices of approximately $5.00, this is the change in option price if the interest rate changes by one full percentage point. But a full one percentage point change in short-term interest rates is not something that happens very often or very quickly when it does happen. In today’s market, the Federal Reserve seems to be planning to keep interest rates at the current level below one percent for the foreseeable future. 

  

Looking up and down the rows and across the cells in Table 1, you can see that the call rho and absolute value of the put rho increase when the options are in the money. But in all cases, rho is a small number given that interest rates rarely change by one full percentage point in a short period of time. 

  

**Is Rho Useful?**

  

Given that a "large" change in the short-term interest rate — greater than one full percentage point — is unlikely to occur in a short period of time — less than one month — it seems clear that rho should not be a big concern to option traders. 

  

"But wait a minute!" some traders protest. "When Bernanke hinted that interest rates would rise, the market dropped dramatically; and that drop caused option prices to change dramatically as well!" 

  

Yes, fear of rising rates caused the market to drop, but it was the drop in the market that caused option prices to change. It was not the rise in the interest rate with other factors unchanged. It was the delta that caused the change in option prices, not the rho. 

  

**Conclusion**

  

Rho estimates the change in an option’s price if the interest rate assumption is changed by one percentage point and other factors remain constant. Although changing interest rates, or the rumor of changing rates, might cause the market to rise or fall, the resulting change in option prices is the result of delta, not rho. For most option traders, rho should be of little concern.

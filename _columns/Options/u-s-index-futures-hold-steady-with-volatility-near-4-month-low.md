U.S. stock-index futures were little changed as investors turned cautious in the year's last full week of trading, following a rally that sent equities to record levels.


S&P 500 futures expiring in March rose 0.1% to 2,263 at 6:03 a.m. in New York. The underlying benchmark closed 0.1% higher on Monday, while small-cap shares jumped 0.6%. Contracts on the Dow gained 24 points to 19,861 Tuesday. The CBOE Volatility index dropped for a fourth session, set for its lowest close since August. The gauge of investor anxiety, known as the VIX, has tumbled 48% since a Nov. 4 peak.


Strategists on average expect the S&P 500 to end 2017 at 2,356, according to the mean of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That implies a 4.1% gain from Monday's close. The gauge has advanced 11% this year, putting it among the top four developed-market benchmarks. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap firms has climbed almost 15% since the day of the U.S. election. All four major benchmarks reached all-time highs after the vote, with financial firms leading gains on bets higher borrowing costs will boost profitability.

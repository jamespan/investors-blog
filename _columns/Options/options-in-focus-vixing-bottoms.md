With less than 30 minutes to go, the S&P 500 has challenged its August low with a narrow undercut of those prices and the numerically well-followed 1100 level. In sympathy, the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" has traded just through 45% intraday. Both are good signs of a potential bottom, but will they prove enough as far as technical support for a lasting low?

  

The opinion of this strategist is for bargain-hunters to continue showing restraint as 1100 could be followed by 1000 before all is said and done as far as more lasting bottoms are concerned. Our worry as we enter the notoriously weak month of October and a period known for its scary-looking market lows is the current test doesn't measure up historically or visually. 

  

On the one hand, 45% in the VIX is historically fearful enough to conjure up images of treats for bargain hunters. Plenty of major bottoms have occurred with readings between 30% and current levels. However and what we feel to be more important; underlying volatility in the market has largely justified premiums remaining elevated without being truly over the top as far as a panicked bull and playable bottoms are concerned. 

  

For panic too occur on a relative basis, we'd at least like to see the mean-reverting VIX stretch 15% or more relative to its 10-day simple moving average, before thinking bulls have gotten too frightened. We'd also like to see the August highs of 48% get taken out and perhaps a jump to 50% or even 55% before getting excited about a bottom which may not look anything like today's mainstream double but could set up a nice "glass half full" retracement opportunity.

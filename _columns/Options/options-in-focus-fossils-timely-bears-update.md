Soon-to-be "former" IBD 50 constituent and consumer accessory fashionista **Fossil** ([FOSL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOSL)) saw a Rolex style price move for a few bears spied positioning. The stock was detailed in this column yesterday.

  

Previously discussed "nervous and defensive posturing" in front of last night's earnings report which featured below views guidance for Q2, was evident in FOSL shares as the stock broke decisively below its 50-day simple moving average.

  

Option traders chimed in by pouncing on well-bid puts by a 2.37-to-1.0 margin with particular focus on opening paper in the slightly out-of-the-money May 120 put and then, well-out-of-the-money May 105 put.

  

Fairly equal volume of 3,300 and 3,900 in both puts, strong but not exactly through-the-roof, "something is fishy in Denmark" implieds, as well as past close-to-close earnings reactions of +12.7%, -12.5%, -2.5% and +14.7% had this strategist praising the merits of accessorizing a long put with a short one to form a bear put spread.

  

Our view was that for a directional trader wishing to lean short, the May 120 / 105 put vertical, with the short strike some 16% out of the money, and ATM implieds pricing another "been there, done that" stiff but not abnormal 14% expected move; made practical use of premium by cutting down the dollar risk of a naked long put with a spread and a short contract unlikely to go in-the-money.

  

With shares near down about 37.50% near 78.50, our own brand of good sense and cents, obviously added up with the spread priced, for all intents and purposes, at its max payout of $15. Of course, that's a good deal less than the $44.50 or even $27.50 both the 120 and 105 puts, for bears naked long those options, are enjoying as the going market price. Nonetheless, branding oneself as a bear with a vertical is likely still enough to now buy that Rolex and trade up.

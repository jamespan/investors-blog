It always pays to look at the menu, even if you think you know what's being offered. Such appears to be the case with **Chipotle** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)). While the name has been associated with growth for more than a couple years now, along of course, with the occasional technical stock hiccup or burp; its options are realistically just improving to the point that select spreads might be considered and realistically have a chance of getting a fill.

  

For investors craving the intermediate term, wishing to maintain ownership of shares but who see today's breakout attempt from a high handle as maybe less fresh than with past buy points; a collar might be something to consider ordering from Chipotle's option menu.

  

  

Shown above is a centered collar on three contracts using the May 270 put and 290 call for virtually even money with shares at 280 intraday. The risk profile mimics a bull call spread using the same strikes but some longer-term traders prefer collars due to potential preferential tax treatment. There's even the possibility for accumulating additional shares on weakness without double dipping into the piggy bank, like one would have to with outright stock ownership. 

  

Quoted markets in CMG are still slightly loose but approachable given its underlying volatility. That's a vast improvement from days prior, when executing the likes of a collar had a slimmer chance of getting filled than ordering and actually receiving a seafood sub from that other menu of offerings at Chipotle.

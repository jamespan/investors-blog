A backspread looks to position with net long contracts using all calls for bullish opinions and all puts for those carrying a bearish axe. With the former, a greater number of a higher up, same month strike call is purchased relative to a lower call strike. This forms a ratio spread with common configurations being (-1) x 2, (-1) x 3 and (-2) x 3. 

  

Lower implieds helps this spread as the trader is a net buyer of premium, thus the reduced contract cost will allow for a potential small credit or tinier debit to enter into the position. Ultimately, the initiation cost will also rest with the ratio one uses, as well as the strike price distance between the sold and purchased contracts. Where shares are in relation to the backspread and the amount of time until expiration for the position will also affect costs.

  

As for the risk / reward profile, the max risk of the backspread is going to be at the purchased strike at expiration. At that point, the long contracts would be worthless and the trader would be facing an in-the-money short. Thus, the dollar amount at stake is the difference between strikes minus any credit received or if a debit was involved; adding that amount to the total bill of sale. 

  

On the upside, which if we're looking at a call backspread, the trader begins to reduce his or her loss upon shares passing through the purchased strike at expiration. Prior to that time, the value of the spread can potentially increase in value and see profits if shares begin to move in that direction quickly and / or enjoy an increase in implied volatility, which would stand to benefit the net long contract backspread position.

  

The other upside to this particular kind of backspread is the downside, if the undesired move in shares is significant enough. The reason being, if the stock is below the lower sold call, both calls would expire worthless and allow the trader to keep the credit or have a much smaller loss on their hands than other bullish strategies less flexible when dead wrong on direction. 

  

  

One name this type strategy might look suitable on is men's and women's designer label **Michael Kors**  ([KORS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KORS)). To illustrate, above we're looking at a (-1) x 3 October 44 / 55 call backspread which looks to take advantage of reasonable implieds which have fallen to multi-month lows and are probably more likely to stabilize or rebound than continue lower. 

  

Technically, the IBD 50 constituent and recent IPO is attempting to breakout from a corrective weekly cup-shaped base after posting all-around better-than-forecast earnings results this week. However, if ever-fashionable and sometimes fickle investors have a change of heart, the backspread largely guards against the legacy of all gaps, even bullish ones, getting filled, especially if the other guy or gal's potential double top has any say in matters.

Last night we discussed the prospects for a short straddle in IBD 50 constituent **Chipotle Grill**  ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) following its mixed results. An initial after-hours reaction has proved spot-on as last night's modest profit-taking of about 2% has held with about 30 minutes left in the session. 

  

For our illustrated Weeklys -1x February 370 straddle priced at $20.70 and 95% IV, the resulting mild and far-from-red-hot stock action has resulted in a gain of about $1,300 or 13 points out of a possible 20.70. However, with the set-to-expire short put trading virtually like long stock and the strategist's short call all but a rip-up, but still on the sheets, there remain both opportunity costs, as well as potential real losses if no action is taken and Friday's expiration proves a more fiery affair in terms of stock movement.

  

  

Figure 1: Chipotle (CMG) Short Straddle vs. Bull Vertical Adjust Comps 

  

A trader with delicious paper profits from a short straddle can't be blamed if he or she simply exits the position and pockets the 13 points. But it's not the only option; pardon the pun, in town if they happen to have a more pronounced view on direction at this point in time. 

  

One possible adjustment and shown above in relation to the original short straddle would be to get short a bull vertical put spread if the trader believes the reaction was an overreaction. While that's not exactly the view of this strategist, this type of direction bias could be negotiated by purchasing back the short call for about $0.25 and buying the new slightly out of-the-money 360 put for a price of $2.20 currently. The net debit of $2.45 eats into one's existing profits by that dollar amount if shares rally higher. But as readers can also see, existing gains are largely protected in the event CMG moves lower into Friday's expiration. Hmm, I guess that's called having your burrito and eating it too, without worrying about a case of the technical runs from other investors.

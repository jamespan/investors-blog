It's no great surprise that **Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) has been a strong performer of late, given that the company makes software intended to facilitate clinical trials for companies like **Moderna** ([MRNA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA)) and **AstraZeneca** ([AZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AZN)) that are researching Covid-19 treatments.




Veeva stock is ranked number one in the medical software group with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 93. Keep track of these ratings at [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/).


Veeva Systems is due to announce third-quarter earnings on Nov. 26. One thing I've noticed with these strong tech names is they tend to rally, or at least not fall by much in the lead-up to earnings.


VEEV held a half-size stake on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) headed into Monday's session. The stock got a lot of airplay in Monday's [IBD Live show](https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&src=A00433A) too.


Today, I want to take a look at a strategy called a poor man's covered call. To execute a poor man's covered call, the trader will buy a long-term, deep in-the-money call and sell a short-term out-of-the-money call. The long-term bought call effectively replaces the long stock position at a fraction of the cost.


Constructing The Poor Man's Covered Call In Veeva Stock
-------------------------------------------------------



To trade a covered call on Veeva stock, an investor would need to buy 100 shares of the stock at a total cost of around $30,600. Shares hit as high as 308.28 on Monday.


A similar exposure can be obtained through buying a call option that expires Jan. 21, 2022, with a strike price of 260. That call was trading on Friday for around $72 or $7,200. That still costs much less than buying 100 shares.


The trader can then sell monthly covered calls against that position as normal.


For example, selling a Nov. 20 call with a strike price of $310 would generate nearly $1,400 in premium, as of Monday's early-afternoon trading, and still provide some capital gain potential.


Know These Risks With Options
-----------------------------


The downside of the trade is that gains and losses will be magnified as you are effectively trading a leveraged position.


Even though you are risking less capital, the exposure is almost the same as owning 100 shares.


In terms of risk management, I would rethink the position if Veeva stock dropped below the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). The 50-day line has risen to 272.40.


Options are risky. Investors can lose 100% of their investment.

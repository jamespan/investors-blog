**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) isn't exactly a solar stock but its shares were on fire technically Tuesday along with the fore-mentioned alternative energy industry group. With half an hour to spare in the session, shares of NFLX are up about 8% after building upon early strength with nary a headline to support bulls and despite a massive Japan-driven sell-off in the major averages. 

  

One week ago in analyzing NFLX's stock and options, we were personally inclined to see a bit more downside in the stock. The outlook was for NFLX to fill a gap and test up-channel support before possibly re-affirming its uptrend. That was on March 8. What we can now say definitively is the "lower, but non-cigar like" price action proved "close enough" in a market where perfect tests are typically for textbooks only. 

  

With today's gain in share price, our illustrated softer delta bear which incorporated a two lot regular March 195 / 185 / 180 / 170 long put condor has nearly lost its entire max loss of $490. As it would like right now, the position shows a paper loss of about $465 or just more than 2% on a portfolio sized at $20K.

  

  

On the other hand and minus a day i.e. if we go back and request a Mulligan, conditions were actually already suspected for the spread position. While shares were still finding resistance at that point at the 50-day simple moving average, the long put condor was out -$255 or just more than 50% of its investment. And in one option trader's opinion, a drop of -1% for a short-term swing is more important to consider than what those other price lines may or may not say at the same time.

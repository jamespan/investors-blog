Being assigned on an option is often associated with a negative outcome for the short-contract holder. The reality though can be far different. In fact, the possibility of this fact of life for option traders shouldn't be fretted nor much of a surprise in most instances. And if you're extremely lucky, you may even find your account all the better for it without having to do a thing.

  

To illustrate, let's use a bull put spread on the venerable XYZ Corp (XYZ). Let's assume a bullish trader sold the February 50 / 45 put vertical for $1.50 per spread with shares of XYZ at 50. Individual markets for the spread had the 50s priced at $2.00 and the 45s for $0.50. 

  

Now let's suppose with shares unchanged the next day, your broker sends you an assignment notice on your short 50 put. With nearly three weeks until expiration, this admittedly very unlikely assignment would result in a limited risk / limited return bull vertical turning into a synthetic long February 45 call with unlimited upside. And better yet, holding the stock price constant, the position would be at a discount to the real call market. 

  

The assignment of the 50 put means the trader is purchasing stock at 50. But since the trader is long the 45 put, the new position is the equivalent of a married put or synthetic call with its maximum risk below 45. And what is that maximum risk? It's simply the same amount we allowed for by selling the original put spread. 

  

Since a $1.50 credit was taken in on the five-point spread, that means our long February 45 synthetic call has $3.50 in risk. However, relative to the going call market that day, which due to arbitrage would be priced in the neighborhood of $5.40 bid / $5.60 ask, this particular (long shot) assignment would result in an instant paper profit of $2.00 per married put with all else remaining equal. 

  

Of course, since markets do move in the real world, we'd still have to sell the same strike call to lock in a conversion or sell out the stock and put to close the married put. But with no added downside risk, it's certainly not something I'd mind waking up to on a regular basis. 

  

As expressed, this type of outright (discount) gift doesn't occur all too often. In fact, it really can't be counted on as ever happening without a heaping dose of good luck. But if it does occur, the open-ended reward profile of the long call does set a trader up for even faster and potentially larger profits than with the bull put spread. Hence, this is one math assignment you shouldn't mind accepting.

The euro rose to the strongest level in more than a month vs. the dollar after two polls showed Emmanuel Macron was the most convincing in Monday night's French presidential debate.


The shared currency strengthened against most of its Group-of-10 peers as concerns over euro-area political risks continue to abate. Macro interest grew stronger for euro-longs while some leveraged accounts unwound their shorts, according to Europe-based traders who asked not to be identified as they aren't authorized to speak publicly. The traders noted that unwinding of euro-shorts in the options market and some outright demand for upside exposure on tenors up to two months have also supported the currency.


The euro climbed 0.5% to $1.0795, after earlier touching $1.0804. It reached a one-week high above 1.0750 against the Swiss franc as bearish bets in the front end hit their lowest level on a closing basis in five months. A bullish technical signal suggests the pair may overtake the 1.08 handle a second time this year.


The pound was Tuesday's best performer vs. the dollar after a report showed U.K. inflation beat estimates to rise above the Bank of England's target for the first time in more than three years. Sterling climbed to $1.2472, its highest level since Feb. 27, as it filled offers above $1.2400 and stops were triggered near $1.2450. Traders noted fading interest at $1.2470-$1.2480 while stops entries lie above the figure.

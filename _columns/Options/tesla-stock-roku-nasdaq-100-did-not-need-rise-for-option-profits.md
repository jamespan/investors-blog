You don't need a stock to go up to have a good option trade. Over the last month, we featured bearish option trades in ROKU stock and Tesla stock and a Nasdaq 100 trade that benefited from sideways action. Here's how they did.




Bear Call Spread On Tesla Stock
-------------------------------


Tesla ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) was one of the best performers of 2020, but that hasn't carried over to 2021. Like the Nasdaq composite, Tesla stock kept running into resistance at its [21-day moving average line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/). We outlined a [bear call spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tsla-stock-bear-call-spread/) on Tesla stock on March 17.


The setup involved selling the April 750 call and buying the 755 call with the same expiration. The price at the time brought in about $180 per spread.


Since then, Tesla stock has declined from 700 to 611. The bear call spread that was initially sold for $1.80 can be bought back for $0.30.


That's a profit of $150 per spread where we risked $320 in capital. In percentage terms, that's a 47% return in just a couple weeks.


If you hold to expiration, you could get the maximum profit in the Tesla bear call spread. But there's not much point keeping the trade open to try to achieve the last $30 in profit. There will be better opportunities elsewhere. By closing the trade we can free up the capital for those new opportunities.


Bearish Calendar Spread On Roku Stock
-------------------------------------


On March 19, we looked at [buying a bearish calendar spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/roku-stock-bearish-calendar-spread-option-trade/) on **Roku** ([ROKU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ROKU)). The premise was that Roku stock seemed to be on its way to the 200-day moving average at around 250. The trade involved selling an April 250 put and buying the May 250 put for a cost of $500.

Since then, Roku stock has dropped from 340 to 300. The bearish calendar value is now worth around $780. That's a profit of $280 or 56% in just a couple weeks. It already hit our 30% profit target set at the beginning. Like the Tesla stock trade, this one can be closed out now.


Options Trades Can Profit Up, Down Or Sideways
----------------------------------------------


The Tesla and Roku trades above demonstrate why options are such a flexible tool. Traders can achieve profits when stocks decline, rather than just trading the long side.


Another way to use options for profit is taking a neutral stance on a stock or index.


Early in March, there was a spike in volatility for the Nasdaq 100 and we proposed an [iron condor trade](https://www.investors.com/research/options/qqq-etf-iron-condor-options-trade/) on the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)). The iron condor profits from time decay. As long as you don't get too much movement in either direction, you do well.


The setup involved a bull put spread selling the 265 put and buying the 260 put with an April expiration for a credit of $0.60. At the same time, we laid out a bear call spread selling the 330 call and buying the 335 call with the same expiration for $0.80. That brings in $140 while risking $360 for a potential 39% return.


With the Nasdaq 100 index remaining relatively stable and implied volatility dropping, the trade has done well. The iron condor can now be bought back for around $80 for a total profit of $60. That's a 17% return for sideways movement.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

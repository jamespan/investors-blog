**Meta Platforms** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) is [near a trend line buy point](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-stock-market-rally-pauses-tesla-google-meta-near-trend-line-buy-points/) and FB stock is showing elevated implied volatility. 




The company, formerly called Facebook, is ranked No. 4 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 89, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 95 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 71. 


One mildly bullish option strategy to consider on FB stock is a bull put spread. This can be a good strategy to implement when a trader has a slightly bullish outlook, and implied volatility is higher than normal. 


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. 


Selling the February-expiration, 335-strike put and buying the 330 put would create a bull put spread.


FB Stock Option Trade Offers 61% Return
---------------------------------------


This spread was trading Tuesday for around $1.90 per share. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $190 in option premium for a block of 100 shares and would have a maximum risk of $310. 


That represents a 61% return on risk between now and Feb. 18 if FB stock remains above 335. 


If Meta Platforms stock closes below 330 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $310. 



The break-even point for the bull put spread is 333.10, which is calculated as 335 less the 1.90 option premium per contract. 


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 4, which means it is a similar exposure to owning four shares of FB stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves. 


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $1.90 to $3.20, I would consider closing early for a loss. 


Meta Stock Trade Has Earnings Risk
----------------------------------


With earnings due in late January, this trade on FB stock would have earnings risk if held to expiration. 


A bear call spread on **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) [explained in the Dec. 7 column](https://www.investors.com/research/options/bearish-on-c-stock-this-option-trade-offers-a-16-return-on-risk/) has performed well and can be closed early for nearly the full profit. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

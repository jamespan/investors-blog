Fourth-quarter earnings season is finally here, and Wall Street is worried that results and outlooks might not be up to snuff. Amazon stock is trying to break out of a downtrend ahead of its Jan. 31 earnings report. Amazon stock closed at 1,640 on Jan. 11. Based on the closing price, the expected move after earnings is roughly 135 bucks, or 8.2%.




Compare that with a 'normal' volatility of 3% a week and you have the makings of an explosive move in either direction for Amazon stock.


Earnings season is always a tumultuous time for investors, as there are few assumptions that can be made or believed. In recent years we have witnessed the 'haves and the have-nots.' Those sporting strong numbers and guidance are often rewarded, while those who miss get severely punished. IBD is very useful in finding the names that have the highest probability of success.


VIX In Freefall
---------------


Market volatility has declined sharply since the big rally started on Dec. 26. Overall we have seen the VIX fall some 50%. What does that mean for stocks and investors? Much less angst about taking on risk, but now there is some built-in complacency. Implied volatility in stocks is elevated due to the expected wide ranges we'll see post earnings, but market volatility is crashing. That's a divergence that can get you in trouble if you're not careful.


Option Trade For Amazon Stock
-----------------------------


**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) stock has been hit hard by selling in recent months, but it's still a top-rated stock in IBD's database with a Composite Rating of 91.


It's hard to find an edge here based on the price, and options are extremely expensive. So how should this be played for volatility? I would suggest using a vertical call and put strategy known as a condor out of the money. This would combine purchasing a call spread and a put spread. The spread defines our risk (in this case, we probably go with a 10 or 15 wide spread for each, such as a 1700/1710 call spread and 1580/1570 put spread.


The cost of the trade is $300 per side (spread), so the total risk is a mere $600. If the stock reaches 1710 by expiration, your call spread will be worth $1000 per contract. The put spread would be worthless. Alternatively, if the stock crashes through 1570, the put spread will be worth $1000 per spread, and the call spread will be worthless.


Amazon Stock: Volatility Trade
------------------------------


It's a volatility trade. The hope is that Amazon moves more than market expectations when it reports earnings at the end of the month.


If the market is right, one of the spreads is going to pay off nicely while the other will fade away to dust. The trade is not a bet on direction, rather simply a way to piggyback on the expected market volatility for this name.



Here's how one call-spread trade and one put-spread trade would be executed for one contract:


Buy one 1,700 call (Feb. 8 expiration)


Sell one 1,710 call (Feb. 8 expiration)


Buy one 1,580 put (Feb. 8 expiration)


Sell one 1,570 put (Feb. 8 expiration)

**Freeport McMoRan** ([FCX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FCX)) spent some time on [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) a few days ago and took the spotlight in Monday's [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/). So we are looking at a strategy that has the potential to generate a healthy return — provided FCX stock stays above 37.




The strategy is called a broken wing butterfly. We will use put options in FCX stock because the strikes will all be out-of-the-money. Doing this minimizes assignment risk.


The wings are placed an equal distance from the short strike for a regular butterfly trade. However, we leave a larger gap on a particular side with a broken wing butterfly.


As a result, broken wing butterflies have less risk on one side and more risk on the opposite side.


FCX Stock: Setting Up The Broken Wing Butterfly
-----------------------------------------------



Let's look at how we can set up a broken wing butterfly trade on FCX stock.


* Buy 1 Dec. 17-expiration 32-strike put @ 0.35
* Sell 2 Dec. 17 37 puts @ 1.45
* Buy 1 Dec. 17 39 put @ 2.30


Notice that the upper strike put option lies 2 points away from the middle, and the lower put sits 5 points away.


This broken wing butterfly trade will generate $25 in premium.


Risk Vs. Reward
---------------



If FCX stock closes above 39 at expiration, all the puts expire worthless. The trader keeps the $25 premium.


On the downside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the difference between the various strikes (5 - 2) multiplied by 100 and subtracting the premium received (25). That gives us 3 x 100 - 25 = $275. Calculate the maximum gain as 2 x 100 + 25 = $225.


The ideal scenario for the trade: FCX stock stays above 39, or closes around 37 at expiration.


As the trade starts with a delta of 11, this strategy poses as a slightly bullish strategy. The initial exposure is roughly equivalent to owning 11 shares of FCX stock.


A broken wing butterfly could be an excellent way to trade FCX stock for those with a neutral to slightly bullish outlook.


I would set a stop loss if FCX broke below 36.


Freeport McMoRan likely reports earnings in January, so there should be no earnings risk with this trade.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

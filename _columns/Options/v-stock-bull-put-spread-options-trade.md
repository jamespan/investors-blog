**Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) has broken back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) with a slightly improved [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) (although it's still rather low at only 18).




An easy option trade worth looking at on V stock is a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration. To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish V Stock Option Trade**
--------------------------------


Traders who think Visa stock will not drop below 200 could look to sell a March 19 200 put and buy a March 19 195 put.


Yesterday, this spread was trading for around $0.95 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $95 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $405. That represents an 23.46% return on risk between now and March 19 as long as V stock remains above 200.


If Visa stock closes below 195 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $405.



The break-even point for the bull put spread is 199.05 which is calculated as 200 less the 0.95 option premium per contract.


If Visa's stock price drops below 200, I would close the trade early for a loss.


The next earnings release for V stock is set for April 29, so this trade would not have earnings risk. The main downside for the trade is that implied volatility is only 24% which is toward the lower end of the 12-month range.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) has been underperforming the market recently but is a quality company and AMZN stock is trading around 12% below its 52-week high.




Quality companies don't remain cheap for too long and with Q4 earnings just around the corner this could a be a nice time to look at a bullish option trade on AMZN stock.


Traders could look to sell a Feb. 5 bull put spread with the short strike at 2,900 and the long strike at 2,890.


Yesterday, this spread was trading for around $2.45.


I would look to sell this spread if it got to around $3 which would give the trade a maximum gain potential of $300 with maximum risk of $700.


That represents a 32.5% return on risk between now and February 5 as long as Amazon stock remains above 2,900.


The Bull Put Spread Profits In A Wide Range
-------------------------------------------


If Amazon stock closes below 2,890 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $700.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 2,897, which is calculated as 2,900 less the $3 option premium per contract.


If Amazon's stock price drops below 2,900, I would close the trade early for a loss.



Amazon's fourth quarter earnings could be positive given the huge amount of online shopping that would have taken place over the Christmas period.


The notional exposure for this bull put spread is around $2,800 so the trade is roughly equivalent to owning slightly less than one share of AMZN stock.


However, that exposure level will change as the stock moves due to the nature of option pricing.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

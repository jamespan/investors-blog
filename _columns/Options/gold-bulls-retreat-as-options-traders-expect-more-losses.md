Gold bulls are on the retreat.


 


Price movements in the most-traded gold options in New York on Monday signal traders are expecting gold to extend losses, as futures touch the lowest in more than a month. Prices have fallen since trading at a one-year high on March 11.


Investors are backing away from the precious metal amid signs the U.S. economy is resilient enough to face another interest rate increase, even as global growth weakens. Traders are pricing the odds of a rate increase by September at 58%, up from 43% a month earlier, according to fed funds futures data tracked by Bloomberg. Higher rates make gold less attractive against interest-bearing assets.


Options that give buyers the right to buy gold for May delivery at $1,245 an ounce fell 7.6% to the lowest since Feb. 5. The April contracts are expiring Monday.


"Perhaps gold has seen short-term highs,"  Tai Wong, the director of commodity products trading at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said by phone.


Gold futures for June delivery slipped 0.2% to $1,221.20 an ounce at 10:03 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after touching $1,207.70, the lowest intraday for a most-active contract since Feb. 23.


On Friday, government data showed the U.S. economy grew in the fourth quarter at a revised rate of 1.4%, faster than the previous estimate of 1%, supported by stronger household spending that’s helping cushion the expansion from weakness overseas. On Monday, data showed incomes rose 0.2%, pushing the saving rate to a one-year high.


Gold’s renewed weakness is in line with the outlook from bears including **Goldman Sachs Group** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), which has stuck with its forecast for a slump, even as the metal gained this year. The bank gave a near-term target for $1,100 in a March 7 note, citing prospects for further strengthening of the U.S. economy.


Investors will also be watching a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday, when she’s due to speak at an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York. In the runup to next month’s gathering of the Federal Open Market Committee, Yellen has stressed that every session is a "live possibility" to raise rates.


While prices have been dropping, investors have continued to expand their holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. The assets rose for an eighth day to 1,770.5 metric tons on March 24, the highest level since December 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Silver futures gained on the Comex, while palladium and platinum slipped on the new York Mercantile Exchange.

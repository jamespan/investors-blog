Shares of big box electronics outfit **Best Buy**  ([BBY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BBY)) finished down about -6.5% following its mixed earnings release. The price action technically pushed shares below lateral congestion by a slim margin before rallying enough to close just above technical support. 

  

What tomorrow will bring is uncertain but for those in agreement the price action looks deserved of some downside follow-through, a bear vertical looks to be a fitting strategy. With premiums still elevated, this spread, whether executed as a debit put spread or call credit spread, removes vega risk and maintains a limited- risk profile. 

  

With just three sessions left in the September contract and December's 94 days a bit too much time to help the vertical along quickly if BBY's technical tea leaves do begin to falter further, then October is our month of choice for positioning. With one point wide strikes and penny increments traders can easily and efficiently choose from a wide range of in and out of the money verticals.

  

  

One such vertical to illustrate how this bearish position could look is the October 24 / 25 call spread. Priced for $0.40, the position is currently out of the money by about 3% and in position to collect the credit in full as long as shares don't move above 24 come expiration. We've set the spread up as a 12 lot, which on a $20K portfolio amounts to $720 risk or less than 4% if left unmanaged and shares of BBY lift above the protective 25 strike.

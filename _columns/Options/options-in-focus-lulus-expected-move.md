IBD 50 constituent and yoga centric retailer **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) reports its quarterly results tomorrow before the opening bell. In front of the announcement stock traders prepped their portfolios by pressuring shares lower by about 1% after gapping higher in sympathy with the broader market, but then opting to go its separate way. 

  

The action got the attention of option traders with volume surging nearly 1,500% above its 50-day simple moving average on a bit more than 79,000 contracts. The expected move as assigned by traders using implied volatility and the bell curve as their guide suggests a 68% chance LULU shares will remain within 11% from its current price near 70 a share or a range of 62.30 to 77.70 through this Friday. 

  

Another expected move was formulated today by one large trader in Lululemon's regular June 67.5 / 60 put spread. The two strikes were the day's most active by a wide margin with very even volume of about 13,000 apiece. Of that volume, 8,700 spreads went up early in the session for $1.30 compared to a closing price of $1.88. Given much smaller existing open interest of about 3,700 in each strike, the spread looks to be the opening of a fresh position. 

  

If we had to guess as to which side the initiating party was on, we'd be partial to that person buying the vertical as a bear put spread. That interpretation is based on LULU having corrected but not to the extent of the downward-dog style positioning of the broader market, given its high beta of 2.06. To boot, our interpretation of LULU's chart is bearish. That's based on its bearishly aligned 10, 30 and 50-day simple moving crossover which mostly contained a still under development right shoulder as part of a head and shoulders top. 

  

We could be wrong of course. For one, the trader could be selling a bullish out-of-the-money put spread with the possibility of accepting assignment on shares below 67.50 with an effective purchase price of 66.20. There's also the possibility of long stock in some ratio being involved. This would give a trader some degree of protection and possibly even a profit if shares fell. But below 60 and just south of the always closely watched 200-day simple moving average, this bull will have seen his or her best positional situation, falter, and perhaps badly at that.

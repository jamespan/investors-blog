With about an hour left in Monday's session, the price is right for at least a few bulls as evidenced by the broader averages climbing back through their 50-day simple moving averages and showing staunch percentage gains. The only thing missing to confirm a follow-through day is "vastly lower" volume, which doesn't support the price movement.

  

As some bulls and bears sail higher on the pseudo Columbus day holiday, the question of whether investors should "cheat" and maybe appreciate Monday's lighter volume as a result of some markets being closed rather than a more meaningful blemish of failed sponsorship, might be raised. I don't claim to have an answer to this question; though I'd be interested in others thoughts.

  

What I can say authoritatively is an investor doesn't loss less money on a position because the volume was lighter, when looking at an identical price move. Second-guessing or rationalizing a reason to stay the course, even on a limited risk spread, isn't advised, when price action is telling us we're on the wrong side and allows for the slighter pinch of the P & L.

  

On that note, our discussion last Thursday evening of positioning a short-term bear vertical with the **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) Weeklys October 115 / 112 puts falls into this category. Priced for $0.93 at the time, the illustrated three-lot is currently trading for $0.38. At less than one-half the original price, four trading sessions left and shares now about 3.25% above the purchased strike, things don't look good for the spread.

  

Ultimately, larger favorable moves are required to recoup today's losses because of the mathematics behind option prices as expiration is approached. That all said, what looks better in our opinion, though still worse off, is the decision to take the slightly lighter loss of $0.46 - $0.47 per spread earlier in the session.

  

In the end, we're talking but several pennies difference. As we all know though, those pennies can add up. Further, as today's upside break of average resistance means bears have less to lean on; Day 5 of the market's rally attempt might not mean the bull is fully back, but it's good enough to exit and call it a day and change.

As if to sneak past the heat-seeking radars of smaller bears wishing to follow in lockstep of those larger grizzly hunters, one still very large-looking resident bear in IBD 50 constituent **Questor Pharmaceutical** ([QCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOR)) used what appears to have been a long time or calendar spread to roll out the clock on an existing 4,990 March 35 put into April for $1.50 per contract.

  

By packaging a "sell-to-close" order with the "buy-to-open" April contract, the trader is adding 35 calendar days to the life of the long put position, albeit for the extra cost of $1.50. Remember or realize that cost needs to be added onto the original but unknown debit incurred for the long March put. Thus, if the trader paid $1.50 for that contract in the recent past, they've doubled their dollar exposure in the product. 

  

One interesting side thought regarding this type of roll is how it stacks up or compares to an opening calendar spread. The bought and sold contracts are the same but the difference in holding a long adjusted put and its risk profile wants and "we don't want that!" are vastly different than the real long calendar position. 

  

In the former the trader wants nothing less than a financial Armageddon to occur in the stock or else they'll find one happening in their trading account in the form of much larger losses. At the same and prompting the adjustment, their fear is that type of business-as-unusual, these days in the market at least, won't show up prior to the original contract expiring. 

  

On the other hand, the opening of a long at-the-money put calendar such as the feigned April / March 35 put in QCOR, would love to have shares stay as close to $35 as possible through March expiration. This would allow for the collection of time decay which should more than offset any potential implied volatility damage to the back month during this period and thus result in an expansion of the spread's value beyond today's price of $1.50.

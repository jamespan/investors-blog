**DraftKings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) broke out past an alternative entry Wednesday, closing up 4.6% for the day. The stock was also added to the [IBD SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/#/) portfolio.




Investors who think DraftKings stock will continue to rally could do so in a reduced risk way, with the use of options.


Let's take a look at how we can use options to find a favorable risk-to-reward trade on the assumption that DraftKings might move toward 50 in five weeks.


We will look at a bullish diagonal spread which allows traders to go long on the stock without risking too much capital.


A bullish diagonal spread is a trade that involves buying a call option and selling a shorter-term, out-of-the-money call option against it.


Buying the May 16, 2025, 40-strike call will cost around $1,310. Selling the June 21, 2024, 50-strike call option will generate around $90 in premium.


DraftKings Stock Trade Could Return 28%
---------------------------------------



That results in a net cost for the trade of $1,220 per spread, which is the most the trade can lose.


The maximum profit is estimated at around $340. But that can vary depending on changes in implied volatility. The maximum profit would occur if DraftKings closed right at 50 on June 21 and it represents a return of around 28%.


The idea with the trade is that if DraftKings stock trades up to around 50, the diagonal spread will increase, resulting in a net profit.


A bullish diagonal spread is a good way to gain some upside exposure on a stock without risking too much if the move doesn't materialize.


The combined position has a net delta of 46. That means it is roughly equivalent to owning 46 shares of DraftKings, although this will change as the trade progresses.


Exit Strategy For Option Trade
------------------------------


The suggested stop loss level is a close below 43.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-draftkings-cl-a-dkng.aspx), DraftKings stock is ranked No. 2 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 80, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 80 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92.


DraftKings reported earnings on May 2, so this trade should have no earnings risk if held to expiration.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

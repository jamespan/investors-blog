Bulls of the directional persuasion apparently didn't like hearing Indian IT Services giant **Infosys**' ([INFY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INFY)) had to say about its outlook. A disappointing Q1 and fiscal 2012 forecast sent shares gapping aggressively lower below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving average supports Friday. Infosys was down more than 13% intraday. 

  

Option bulls, well those spied buying premium on a softer and more delta neutral basis however, did fare quite well, albeit against the recent post earnings reaction trend in shares, which while volatile, has proven much more subdued in percentage terms.

  

In front of the report and for long at-the-money strangle April 72.5 / 75 buyers whose options were the most active on the session by a fairly wide margin; the price of admission for Friday's handsome profiteering was a rather steep 115% IV thereabouts. Mathematically, that works out to the options forecasting a roughly two-thirds chance that prices would remain within 6% of last night's closing price of 73.

  

For sellers, last night's premium certainly seemed rich enough to short based on recent post earnings moves of: 5.14%, 2.64%, -5.7%, -3.38% and last quarter's -6.31%. Looking at those closing moves, January's -6.31% closing drop was the only price move in shares out the last five to have actually trumped Thursday's implied move using at-the-money volatilities; and that percentage decline just narrowly bested the 6% mark. 

  

  

As much and without getting into more advanced scalping opportunities, which can definitely skew actual profits and losses, short premium sellers appeared to have the edge going in today. Nonetheless and in a world where history can be an indicator but also far from perfect; when all is now said and done at the end of today's improvement upon history, this special type of bull as shown above, "handled" things quite well.

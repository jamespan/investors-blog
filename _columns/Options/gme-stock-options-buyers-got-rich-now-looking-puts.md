While the trading in **GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) has been truly incredible, the options trading behind it is even more astonishing and profitable.




Everyone has likely already heard about the price swings in GME stock. It traded below 20 for the first couple of weeks of 2021 before exploding higher. It currently sits in the middle of that range at 242 Monday afternoon after its trading was limited at many brokerage firms.


Those who bought GME stock made a small fortune. Those that bought call options on GME stock made a large fortune.


Traders who are now looking to play GME are looking almost exclusively at the options, given the price swings of the last week and the limited risks of options.


First, let's look at those call buyers from a couple of weeks ago.


On Jan. 12, the Feb. 19 calls at the 20 strike were trading for $3.15. In other words, the trader paid a premium of $315 (each contract covers 100 shares) for the right to buy GME stock for 20 until Feb. 19.



They have that right to buy for 20, regardless of how high [GME stock price](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/) goes, thus providing the leverage that call options are known for.


Their only risk is the premium they paid for the calls, or $315, even if GME stock went to zero.


Those are, of course, an extreme example and would have been available only to those people who were in on the very ground floor of this move.


On Jan. 20, with GME stock trading around 39, the Feb. 19 40 strike calls were trading for $7.40, or $740 in total for one contract.


And finally, on Jan. 25, one week ago, with GME stock trading around 77, the 80 calls were trading for $26, costing $2,600 for just one contract.


The Extraordinary Gains Of GME Call Options
-------------------------------------------


We might have thought that the [buyers of those last set of calls](https://www.investors.com/research/options/gme-stock-options-volume-has-exploded/) were too late and paying too high a premium. But the next day, those calls were worth $78, a 200% gain overnight.


The following day, with GME closing the session at almost 350, those 80 calls were trading for $280, a 984% return.


But for those who were lucky enough, and smart enough, and *something* enough to buy those 20 strike calls on Jan. 12? The calls they bought for $3.15 were worth $350. That is a 11,566% return on risk capital. That is the power of leverage in call options.


How Options Trading Actually Works
----------------------------------


And this call buying is also part of the force behind the rise in the stock price. When you buy a call, you are most likely buying it from a market maker.


That market maker is then short that call and has risk if the stock price goes up.


To hedge that risk, they buy stock. And the more the stock goes up, the more stock they must buy to remain what is known as "delta neutral." This plays together with the [short squeeze](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/short-squeeze/) to drive the stock price even higher.


For the last few days, we are seeing a different dynamic play out as traders betting on a drop in GME stock price are using put options.


Put Options: Limited Risk Gains If The Price Drops
--------------------------------------------------


Puts give the buyer the right to sell the stock for the strike price until the expiration date. They pay a premium just like with the call, and just like with the call, that is the most they can lose.


This is why puts can be an attractive alternative to shorting the stock. When you short a stock, you have potentially unlimited risk. Because of this, you get margin calls if the price goes against you. That is exactly what causes the short squeeze.


For the last few trading days, puts have outnumbered calls in GME stock by at least 2-to-1.


But this is not as simple as it might sound. Right now, the Feb. 19 200 strike puts are trading for $76. If you bought those puts you would pay $7,600 for one contract that gives you the right to sell GME stock for $200 any time before Feb. 19.


But as expiration approaches, the stock price would have to be down near $114 for this trade to have a profit. The implied volatility of those puts, a measure of value, is 485%, which is truly astronomical.


Options Trading Is Best Done With An Edge
-----------------------------------------


The best way to use options is when you have a clearly defined edge and you think that the options are mispricing the future.


The buyers of those early call options had that.


Option buyers — or sellers — in GME right now probably do not. GME stock could go back to 20, or it could go back above 500.


Either way, the option prices have a huge amount of volatility already built into them. Remember your Keynes here: "Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."

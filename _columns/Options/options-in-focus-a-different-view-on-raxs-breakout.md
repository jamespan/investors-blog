Monday evening, we talked about letting go of the past and embracing or perhaps allowing something new to be ushered in. The focus of that piece was on learning to appreciate Optionetics modern risk graph versus the old school and still unfortunate industry standard, which does a poor job of effectively displaying the risk and reward of an option position as it relates to the underlying shares. 

  

We happened to illustrate this rather dynamic difference, though it won't make one any richer in real dollars, using niche cloud play and up-and-comer **Rackspace** ([RAX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RAX)). Maybe in an act of coincidence, Rackspace, which has the best Composite Rating within the Internet-Network Solutions Group, broke out today from a very nicely shaped flat base of five to six weeks in length with strong volume confirmation that institutional bulls were involved and supportive of the move. 

  

For their part, option traders did take notice somewhat as contract volume surpassed 7,600 late in the day compared to its daily take of about 4,000. Of that volume, calls were slightly favored and bid on the session. However, theoretically mixed and trading range-entrenched premiums coupled with little in the way of real muscular "Buy, Buy, Buy!" prints; were less than strong tells of any real fast money involvement. 

  

A bigger concern than whether the heat-seeking, fast money crowd is involved in a breakout is the liquidity in RAX's options. Despite a very solid-looking daily average, its call and put markets are "just okay" at best with a typical $1 contract sporting a $0.15 to $0.20 difference between the bid and asking price in its front month January and February options. 

  

  

In lieu of that key factor called liquidity and as expressed earlier today in Wall Street's *Tuesday Lunch Option* at Optionetics (yes, that's a plug), bulls (and traders in general) are or should understand their limited to outrights and maybe two legged spreads such as verticals and calendars. Well, that's not entirely true but it certainly is if one wants to realistically get filled without giving away too much edge to enterâ€”and likely as well, when it comes time to exit. 

  

Currently, seeing how shares are near 33.70, roughly 2.5% to 3.0% above the coveted but sometimes hushed (we'll let you know later) buy point and in lieu of our "lieu" from above; I like a similar risk graph to the one displayed last night. In this instance though and as close to real-time as you'll get from a free observation out of this strategist, the Feb ATMs using 3% catastrophe risk to a hypothetical $20K portfolio looks like less mad and fast but well-positioned money. *What do you think?* *Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.*

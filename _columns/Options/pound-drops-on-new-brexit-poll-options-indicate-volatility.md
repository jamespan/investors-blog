The pound dropped amid signs that support for the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union had increased.


Sterling fell against most of its major peers as ICM opinion polls released Tuesday by the Guardian showed a lead for the leave camp. A phone poll showed 45% of respondents supported leaving, 42% for remaining and 13% were undecided. An online survey also put the Brexit camp ahead.


Bookmaker company William Hill said 85% of all EU referendum bets taken over Monday's public holiday in the U.K. were in favor of Britain exiting the bloc, and that the odds for a Brexit increased.


"I simply don't think that it is warranted to be too sure about the expected outcome of the referendum," said Esther Reichelt, a Frankfurt-based currency strategist at Commerzbank.


The U.K. currency had been boosted in the previous two weeks as an increasing number of surveys indicated that the pro-European vote was gaining strength. Sterling was the best performer in that period among its Group-of-10 peers amid speculation that the risk of Brexit was receding. The Bank of England and the Treasury said that a vote to leave could spark a recession.


The pound depreciated for a second day against the single currency, weakening 0.8% to 76.66 pence per euro as of 3:44 p.m. London time Tuesday. It dropped 0.5% to $1.4565.


An ORB poll for the Daily Telegraph newspaper showed that 51% of definite voters surveyed supported remaining in the bloc, and 46% wanted to leave. This was a narrower lead for the remain camp than in ORB's previous poll.


A gauge of the pound's one-month volatility vs. the dollar climbed to a new six-year high, as traders paid more for bets to lock in prices for the currency pair through options. Meanwhile, the premium for contracts hedging against sterling losses vs. the dollar one month into the future, vs. protecting against gains, were near the highest level since Bloomberg began compiling the risk-reversals data in 2003.


"The latest price action confirms a pattern from recent days where investors were betting on pound-recovery prematurely only to get disappointed in the subsequent days," said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Agricole's corporate and investment-banking unit in London. "The polls are still fairly close for comfort and therefore we continue to advise caution on the pound ahead of the EU referendum."

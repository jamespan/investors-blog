According to some spied market commentary at Investors.com, the now more popular than ever **Aruba Networks** ([ARUN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARUN)) broke out of an "unusual base-on-base" pattern on January 10. 

  

In one option strategist's mind, the only "unusual" thing for stock traders would have been if they had held onto the breakout through today's outsized earnings-related gainer. If that were the case, those bulls would have clearly broken the cardinal rule of minimizing losses to 7% to 8% below the proper buy point which occurred seven days later on January 20. 

  

"Spoiler Alert!!??" Not entirely, in this strategist's opinion. I'm simply here to preach the virtues of trading more volatile stocks in a more deserved way, namely with limited risk option strategies. Without sounding too harsh, the reality of using stops of 7% to 8% as a universal rule fails to consider underlying stock volatility, as well as the sometimes mischievous nuances if the name also happens to be a small and mid capitalization company. 

  

So, what might an option trader do in the same situation while harboring similar optimistic and intermediate-minded intentions? A collar would have been very suitable. In fact, if back on January 10 a trader had decided to number crunch ARUN's statistical volatility of about 50% into the February contract, then 39 days out, in order to establish a fairly smart collar looking in keeping with its volatility; the February 21 / 29 collar with stock at 24.92 made sense to consider. 

  

  

The reality at the time however, dictated slightly different terms. As the highest strike offered in February was the 28 call, the trader would have to make do with the February 22 / 28 collar. But, by February 16 with shares nearing 27 and the protective put having vastly reduced defensive powers in front of Thursday night's reportâ€”the option to adjust into a stronger positioned "up and out" March 24 / 30 collar made both sense and cents in more than one way. 

  

A comparison of the original collar using 400 shares versus the adjusted collar is shown above. Of course, the guy or gal having done the "unusual" thing of simply hanging on to long stock would be showing a larger profit during Friday's session. However, the collar seems less prone to technical rewrites and "shoulda, woulda, coulda" alternative realities.

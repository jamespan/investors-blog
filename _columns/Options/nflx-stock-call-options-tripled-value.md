**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stock price jumped Wednesday after the company issued its earnings release. With that, the call options we looked at last week more than tripled in value.


NFLX stock gapped up above 550 to hit a new all-time high of 593.29 in Wednesday's trade. It finally broke out of the increasingly tight range that had been developing since July.


The stock settled slightly lower in Thursday's trade to close at 579.84.



Last Friday, we [highlighted](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-preview/netflix-stock-earnings-loom-disappoint-wall-street-csx-earnings-baker-hughes-earnings/) NFLX stock going into earnings and looked at a potential call purchase.


There, we looked at the NFLX 520 call option expiring on Feb. 19 that was, at the time, trading for $22.35.


After Wednesday's move, that call was trading for more than $70, a return of more than 200%. With Thursday's trade, the option price settled back down to around $64.


Now this was an expensive option, with just one contract costing $2,235.


And if one wanted to exercise that option, it would require buying 100 shares of stock for 520, for a total cost of $52,000. Most options traders would not exercise the option, but simply sell it back after making the profit and take that risk off the table.


High Implied Volatility of NFLX Stock Options Into Earnings
-----------------------------------------------------------


The implied volatility of the option was high, as is typical going into earnings. But obviously the actual volatility of the stock was even higher, creating this lucrative payout.


It is that high implied volatility that causes many options trades around earnings to lose money.


If you buy a call option with an overinflated premium, you can be right on the direction of the stock and still lose money.


That is why it is so important to have a process around your options trading and to make sure, like we did in the case of NFLX stock, that the options premium is not too expensive on a relative basis.

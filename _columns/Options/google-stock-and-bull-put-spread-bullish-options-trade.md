While tech giants **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) have broken out to new highs, it seems someone forgot to invite Google operator **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), or perhaps better known as Google stock, to the party.




Google stock meets the standards of a strong megacap tech. It boasts a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 96 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 92. The Relative Strength Rating is not great but decent at 81, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-alphabet-inc-cl-a-googl.aspx).


Sitting around 6% below the February high of 1,530.74, could Alphabet play catch up with the other tech titans over the next few weeks?


Traders who believe Google stock will at least remain above 1,350 and wish to learn how to trade options could look at a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


Google Stock: How To Set Up A Bullish Option Trade
--------------------------------------------------



To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. On the chart, the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) is sitting mildly above 1,372, so it makes sense to set the spread below that level.


Selling a July 17-expiring 1,350 put option and buying a 1,340 put would generate around $100 in premium based on yesterday's closing prices.


This trade offers a 11.11% return potential in less than one month, provided Google stock is above 1,350 at expiration.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $100 per contract with a maximum risk of $900. The spread would achieve the maximum profit if Google stock closes above 1,350 on July 17, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless. This would allow the premium seller to keep the $100 option premium.

The maximum loss would occur if the stock closes below 1,340 on July 17. That would see the premium seller lose $900 on the trade.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 1,349, which is calculated as 1,350 less the $1.00 option premium per contract.


How To Trade Options: Where To Set A Stop Loss Order
----------------------------------------------------


Looking at the chart, traders could set a stop loss if the stock breaks below the 20-day moving average, currently around 1,435.


Sticking to this stop loss level will help avoid large losses if the stock starts to decline.


If you're new to options, understand that this trade could lose $900 per contract if Alphabet takes a big tumble.


One thing to note with Google stock options is that the bid-ask spread is quite wide. So this can make it difficult to get filled near the midpoint.

**Pinterest** ([PINS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PINS)) is pulling back to test the rising [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/), which could provide an attractive entry point for option traders.


The stock is reasonably highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 89 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97. The [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) however, is only 42.


Option traders could look to add some exposure through an options strategy known as a cash secured put. A cash secured put on Pinterest stock could allow investors to generate $730 in option premium.


The strategy involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock for the chosen strike price.



The goal is to have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, which happens if Pinterest stock is above the strike price at expiration. If the price is below the strike price at that time, the seller will be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


It's important that anyone selling puts understands that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


For Pinterest stock, a trader selling the Feb. 19 65 strike put could generate around $730 in premium per contract.


The put seller would have the obligation to purchase 100 shares of Pinterest stock at 65 if assigned the short put.


The Cash Secured Put Can Profit Even If The Stock Price Doesn't Rise
--------------------------------------------------------------------


The break-even price for the trade can be calculated by taking the strike price less the premium received which in this case gives a break-even price of 58.60. That's an 11.08% discount to Friday's closing price. The maximum loss on the trade would occur if Pinterest stock fell to $0, which would see the trade lose $5,860.


If the stock stays above 65 at expiration, the put expires worthless, leaving the trader with a juicy 12.46% return on capital at risk in just under seven weeks.


This is calculated by taking the $730 premium received divided by the $5,860 capital at risk.


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls precipitously, the trade will suffer a loss, however the loss will be partially offset by the premium received for selling the put.


Cash secured puts are a fantastic way to generate a return on a stock the trader is happy to own.


For a trade like this, a stop loss could be set around 60 to help prevent large losses.


Pinterest reports earnings on Jan. 27, so this trade would be exposed to earnings risk.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Implied volatility is back up to one month highs in erstwhile growth outfit **Netflix**  ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)). That may not sound overly-menacing given the CBOE Volatility Index's similar rise to four-week highs and more cautious pricing as investors seek out more protective long premium strategies as the market enters the notoriously volatile month of September on a weak note.

  

What may be potentially ominous for NFLX shareholders is Tuesday's extension of recent and longstanding price weakness. With the stock off about 6.5% late today, NFLX has revisited its August lows following a bearish price break below its 50-day simple moving average back in late July. As there are no guarantees in the stock market, bears and/or interested bulls looking to position in the name might look to the option market. While profits can't be assured, those markets do allow for limited risk protection via purchases and various spreads.

  

One bearish position which makes added sense given the more expensive premiums in NFLX is the vertical which largely does away with any unwanted vega or volatility risk. A bear vertical can be designed using all calls or all puts. In either case, the lower strike is sold while a higher same month strike is purchased. Which is better? Typically, if you're looking for shares to simply not breach a certain level overhead, an out-of-the-money bear call spread is most commonly used.

  

Conversely, if you're of the bearish mind a stock is going to move lower, an "at" or out-of-the-money bear put spread is generally the more popular choice. Using lower strike puts also holds favor with most traders over its synthetic in-the-money bear call spread equivalent.

  

In a security such as Netflix where short interest is large but not currently an issue regarding early assignment, it might make additional sense to focus on the put options rather than face the potential for an unwanted short stock position. Interestingly enough, given NFLX's put verticals appear to trade for the same risk-to-reward to even a few pennies to perhaps a nickel cheaper, albeit in today's extra bouncy session; it makes all the more 'cents' to stay tuned in to those contracts.

**Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)) is on my radar today, and the trade I'm looking at has no risk on the upside and a healthy profit zone on the downside.




The strategy is called a broken wing butterfly, and we'll use puts because the short strike will be below the stock price. This helps to reduce assignment risk.


With a regular butterfly option trade, the wings are placed an equal distance from the short strike. But with a broken wing butterfly we leave a larger gap on a particular side.


This results in less risk on one side and more risk on the opposite side.


Setting Up Trade With GOOGL Stock
---------------------------------


Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on GOOGL stock.


* Buy 1 Feb. 16, 120 put at $1.60
* Sell 2 Feb. 16, 130 puts at $4.30
* Buy 1 Feb. 16, 135 put at $6.60


Notice that the upper strike put is 5 points away from the middle put, and the lower put is 10 points away.


This broken wing butterfly trade can be placed for a slight credit of around $40, which means there is no risk on the upside.


Worst-Case Scenario
-------------------


The worst that can happen is that all the puts expire worthless, leaving the trader with a $40 return.



On the downside, the maximum loss is $460 and the maximum gain is $540.


The ideal scenario for the trade is that GOOGL stock stays between 124.60 and 135 for the next two months or so.


The trade starts with delta of 8, so has a slight bullish bias to start. But that will flip to negative delta closer to expiry if the stock is still above 130.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss if GOOGL stock broke below 125, and a profit target of 10%-15%.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

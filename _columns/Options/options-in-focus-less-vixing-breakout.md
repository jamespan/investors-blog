What did investors expect? I'm referring to Monday's push higher by the broader averages, which if one's focus was on a disappointing EU Summit, certainly wasn't supposed to have happened. On the other hand and enjoying strong confirmation of its prescient behavior is the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX.

  

Price action in the market's most notorious sentiment gauge has been very cooperative for bulls looking for spots to enter into and maybe schnitzel a little something from the portfolio during the past several sessions. Just over two weeks ago, the VIX signaled relative overconfidence on the part of bulls by stretching more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average. 

  

Why is that typically important? As a mean-reverting instrument which can't go to zero or infinity (we think), sentiment embodied by the short-term average is prone to moving back towards the smoothed price line when the underlying stretches too far below or above it. 

  

Longer-term and as we wrote in more than a few columns at Optionetics since that cautionary reading emerged on October 14, we did see the first break of 30% in the VIX in more than two month's time as a solid event for bulls as it had acted as lateral support, as well as due to its historical significance as a level of over-the-top fear. 

  

That said and more immediately pressing at the time, the short-term "stretch" suggested a pullback from lows in the VIX before an anticipated second break below 30% might provide the real breakout opportunity for the likes of the S&P 500. Though we'll refrain from taking a deserved hat tip, as the market likes to humble such antics, it is nice when quiet attention paid to market sentiment does yield the desired results. 

  

What will Monday's sunnier market ways yield in the days ahead? Well, according to our continued interpretation of the VIX, today's dip of -6.75% to about 29.20% is a good one for bulls. Not only do we now have a second break below the key 30% level, but prices are about 8% below the 10-day simple moving average compared to a stretchy warning of 15%. Additionally, the VIX is still above its recent fair warning lows set back on the 14th. 

  

I'd go on to think after a prolonged period of abnormally high market volatility, the VIX is due to move back towards more historically normalized levels in the low to mid 20s. If that were to occur, another overly confident stretch signal would be generated. As much and as on the 14th, bulls might want to look at any open long delta positions moving in sync with the broader market and consider lightening up, then look to reload as conditions neutralize short-term.

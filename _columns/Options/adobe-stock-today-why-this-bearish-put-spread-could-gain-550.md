Shares of **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) crashed last week. Adobe stock fell 24% in huge volume following news of its [acquisition of Figma](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/software-stocks-software-growth-stocks/) for $20 billion. When such a quality company has a big drop like this, I like to use a strategy called a diagonal put spread.




Treat this option strategy as an advanced strategy. The reason? It utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.


Adobe Stock Today: How To Set Up The Diagonal Spread
----------------------------------------------------


The trade involves selling an Oct. 21-expiring put option with a strike price of 260 and buying a Nov. 18 put with a strike price of 245. The long put has more time before the option contract expires.


As of Tuesday's close, the October put for Adobe stock could be sold for around $4. And traders can buy the November put for $4.10. The net cost on the trade would be $10, the most the trade could lose on the upside.


The risk with the trade is on the downside, with a potential maximum loss of $1,510. You can calculate it by taking the difference in the spread between the two put options, or 15, multiplied by 100 and adding in the cost of the trade ($10).


The maximum potential gain may hit around $550, if ADBE closes right at 260 on Oct. 21.



The trade has a nice profit zone at 250 to 303. Yet aiming for a return of around 10% to 15% makes sense, and I would set a similar stop loss.


**Biggest Risk In This Trade**
------------------------------


The worst-case scenario arrives with a sharp drop in Adobe stock early in the trade. For this reason, if the stock drops below 260 in the next few days I would consider closing the trade early to minimize losses.


The initial trade setup has a delta of 2, meaning the position is roughly equivalent to owning 2 shares of ADBE stock. Note that this delta number can change significantly as the stock starts to move.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Adobe stock ranks No. 2 in its group. It holsa a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 37, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 92 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 12.


Always remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Yesterday, we talked about the importance of using risk-defined option trades when the market is under pressure. Today, we are going to look at a less commonly used strategy called a call ratio backspread, using Apple stock as an example.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has been under selling pressure in recent days along with other high-profile technology stocks as the 10-year Treasury yield marches higher.


This trade might be appropriate in the current market environment because it can be constructed with zero downside risk while also allowing for some gains if stocks recover.


Apple Stock Option Trade
------------------------


Here's what a trade in Apple stock would look like.


Sell to open 1 AAPL January 2022, 145 strike call @ $7.60.


Buy to open 2 AAPL January 2022, 155 strike calls @ $3.75.


Buying the 145 call cost $760, and selling the two 155 calls brings a credit of $750. Therefore, the net cost of the trade is $10 — the most the trade can lose if Apple stock stays below 145.



If Apple stock rallies early in the trade, profits can occur quickly. For example, if Apple stock rallies to 155 in the next week, it is estimated the trade would show a profit of around $250.


The faster and further Apple stock rallies, the better with this trade.


The catch is the "valley of death," which occurs at expiration between 145 and 165, so this is not a trade that should be held to expiration.


I would hold this trade no more than two to three weeks to avoid falling into the valley of death.


Maximum Loss
------------


The maximum possible loss on the trade is $1,000, which would occur if Apple closed right at 155 on expiration day in January.


This is why we would not want to hold this trade to expiration.


If you are unfamiliar with this type of strategy, it is best to use option modeling software to visualize the trade outcomes at different dates and stock prices. Most brokers will allow you to do this.


Call ratio backspreads are an advanced option trading strategy but could be appropriate in this environment.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

It's easy to see a day like Thursday and wonder, "what just happened?" We're referring of course to the market's hard-hitting reversal of fortune which with losses approaching 2.2% in the S&P 500. While there's a ton of fascinating catalysts with which to pin the damaging action on, only one gave the early heads up and at a minimum, allowed investors to circumvent a good deal of today's losses. If you haven't guessed, it's the VIX and once again, its warning signs proved too prescient to ignore.

  

Just this past Monday, we wrote in this column about that day's unusually strong pressure on the sentiment gauge, which sent the index below 20% support and into a complacently confident stretch relative to its mean-reverting 10-day simple moving average. Trying to rationalize investors much more relaxed demeanor towards risks in the Eurozone and in front of Wednesday's FOMC policy decision, we wondered aloud if the move in the VIX was actually a rare bullish omen for the market, rather than a more traditional sign of warning investors to be cautious.

  

In the end we couldn't just vote in favor of an overly confident investor, though the option of acting like a hedgehog and maintaining an upside bias with real world guarantees of protection with strategies such as collars, was put out there as an alternative for bulls. A collar would have come in handy as it turns out, especially so if it was adjusted as the broader market made one last stab at upside and at trying to convince investors this time really was different with a trio of back-to-back-to-back complacency readings in the VIX. 

  

What will tomorrow bring? Personally we're hopeful there won't be continued bearish follow through in the broader market and that investors can find Friday's headlines conducive to bargain hunting. With the VIX up nearly 16.5% and back to that critical and well-watched 20% level while testing its 10 and 50-day simple moving averages, sentiment has been neutralized short-term and remains more aligned with market uptrends than volatile bear markets on an absolute price basis.

As an options trader and educator, we often discuss the virtues of limited-risk positions in this column. Our favorite during times when the market is moving aggressively higher for an extended period is the bull call vertical. But, in order for a spread like the vertical to be a truly limited risk proposition, it's important to close it down prior to expiration.

  

For most of us, closing down a bull call vertical that's only partially in the money is more or less commonsense. Unless we have some desire to convert the lower strike, long call into shares and allow the exercise assignment to proceed, the choice of simply placing a "sell to close" spread to offset the position means we can book a profit, keep a higher margin position off the sheets and come in flat the next trading day.

  

But what if the position is fully in the money and our idealized maximum profit is there, right before our very eyes? The risk therein lies if the trader long the higher up strike call opts to not exercise his or her right to take hold of shares at that price basis.

  

Who would do such a thing? Well for one, if shares are only slightly in the money for the call that your long vertical is short, don't be so confident the other side is going to help you close down your spread for you. There's always the reality that trader may not want to convert their contracts. Maybe they're not willing to assume the higher margin position over the weekend. Another possibility could be a missed hedge selling shares, which would have washed out the exercise. But now, since they didn't get the leg off, they're no longer in position to convert the calls into stock.

  

If we're talking about a few pennies of opportunity cost the other trader is foregoing by not exercising your short contract, this type of impactful action certainly can't be ruled out. And in truth and depending on the product, such as maybe the high-flying **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), perhaps even some larger and more unfortunate, but pragmatic nickels, dimes or quarters need to be considered as being the cost of doing business. In the end and without this consideration for risk, you're subject to possibly finding out the hard way what it means to forgo having a truly limited risk spread to the sometimes bitter end.

Some investors will always resort to using long stock despite insistence to convert to the dark, or umm derivatives side of the market. But do those investors, who might be holding onto a paper loss, know there's a strategy with options that requires no cost to establish but can possibly yield double the returns of a naked long-stock position, if there's a rebound in share price? There is, and to more than a few educated option traders it's known as a double long position. 

  

The double long is comprised of a call ratio front-spread wherein the trader buys a lower strike and sells two higher strike calls while owning 100 shares of long stock. This strategy can also be thought of as a combined buy-write and bull call spread. The key to doubling one's return with this strategy isn't hard to do. In fact, all that's required is for the trader to locate a 1 x (2) ratio which can be executed for no money, a "close enough for government work" tiny debit or more happily, a small credit. 

  

What might make this position attractive to some potential bulls that wish to own stock anyway (or are already long and maybe wrong) is the combined position of long shares plus the 1 x -2 means there's no short call contract risk above the sold higher strike. Remember or realize this, long stock is a synthetic long call / short put. Hence, the trader maintains two long calls against a short premium hedge of two contracts. 

  

In saying all the above, the magic with "the double" should be less mysterious and easier to see the nuts and bolts of why it works. Instead of a simple long stock position, the double long position is, as already noted, a buy-write and bull call spread for no extra cost. This means up to the strike sold the trader maintains the benefit of doubling his or her return as the bull call vertical widens to its max profit potential, while also producing matching gains in the underlying shares, which would have been owned regardless of the option spread. 

  

The downside of this option-and-stock strategy is two-fold. First, there is actual downside risk involved with owning long stock and which the trader will have to accept and / or look to manage under potentially adverse conditions. As for the ratio spread itself, if shares should move lower a likely worse case would require the trader to buy back the position for a small debit prior to expiration. While the spread would eventually go out worthless below the purchased strike, it could present margin issues or simply pose too much risk for traders to bear in the interim. 

  

The second risk or maybe dilemma some bullish traders face with this combo strategy is while the "double long" does double one's profit pleasure up to the sold strike, beyond that the gains are capped. Remember, in essence we are dealing with a buy-write and a bull call vertical. Both these spreads outperform shares in flat or moderately bullish environments but will make traders feel the pain of lost potential profits on those occasions when a stock pulls a Buzz Lightyear style "To infinity and beyond!"

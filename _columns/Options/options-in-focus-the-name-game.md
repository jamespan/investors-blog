It's funny how a slight name change can make a frowned upon or determined risky trading strategy seem more reasonable and even conservative. In our opinion nowhere is this more apparent than when one assumes the risk of a naked put sale.

  

By selling a put with no other position hedging the sale, a trader is accepting the possibility of assignment and the responsibility of becoming long at the positioned strike. In return for this risk, the trader receives a credit, which can be realized in full if the stock is above the strike at expiration and in turn, the put becomes worthless.

  

For those investors that have been around long enough to remember 1987's stock market crash, perhaps picked one of the plentiful "wrong" companies to write put options on during the dot-bomb era or during the ongoing financial / credit crisis, this type "income collection" strategy might be appreciated as a riskier strategy fraught with considerable downside risk in the event of a technical implosion.

  

Most recently in the states, the broad-based financial sector gave investors a wake-up call choosing to execute naked put sales during the height of the credit market crisis. Bankruptcies in the likes of Lehman Bros., Bear Stearns and **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) and many, many near-death ticker experiences buried portfolios too happy to initially accept the long stock purchase via assignment, before premiums turned toxically worth a great deal more much to the chagrin of the put seller.

  

More current, today's real ghastly stuff even has some countries eyes deep in debt and now subjected to bankruptcy style risks. Greece and Spain of course have the bad fortune of late of being in this ignominious spotlight. The point here is if you haven't been around or don't care much for history, at least realize the risks involved with the naked put sale.

  

In the end and in all of its colorful incarnations made to sound and even look more pleasing to investors; from the "targeted purchase" strategy or "cash-secured put" which means you have the funds available to lose in your account between the strike price and $0.00. There's also the most chummy of them all, the in-disguise put sale known as the buy-write, in the end though, don't be fooled by the risk involved.

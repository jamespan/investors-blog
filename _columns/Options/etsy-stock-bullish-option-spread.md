Etsy stock is showing a similar bullish pattern to that shown by **Xilinx** ([XLNX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=XLNX)) last week as it experiences a near perfect bounce off the 50-day moving average.




**Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97 along with a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97. The only blemish is an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 43.


Option traders that believe the 50-day moving average will hold could look at a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Etsy Stock: Bullish Option Trade
--------------------------------


The 50-day moving average for Etsy stock is currently around 116, so I would look at purchasing a put with a 110 strike price, then placing the short strike around 115. Use the contracts that expire on Sept. 18.

As of yesterday, this spread was trading for around $1.10 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $110 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $390.


That represents an 28.21% return on risk between now and Sept. 18 as long as Etsy stock remains above 115.


If Etsy stock closes below 115 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $390.


For this trade, if Etsy's stock price dropped below 115, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Etsy reported earnings on Aug. 5, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.

With a bull put spread, you always know the worst-case scenario even if Etsy stock tanks.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

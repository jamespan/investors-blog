Shares of money center heavyweight and Dow component **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) has more than a few traders on proverbial pins and needles in front of tomorrow morning’s earnings announcement. That obvious tension didn’t go unnoticed in its options as nearly 200,000 fairly well-bid contracts poised for a volatility hit traded compared to its average daily rake of about 110,000. 

  

“Tension” was most evident in JP’s calls, which outpaced puts by a 2-to-1 margin. Most active, the regular January surrounding money 44 and 45 calls priced at $1.13 and $0.62 per contract saw combined action of nearly 55,000. With implieds in the low 30s, both will require moves of 4% by expiration to double in price but I’d strongly suspect the real verdict regarding value will be approached during Friday’s session. 

  

Personally, of much greater interest to this strategist is what was behind the 10,000 January 2013 50 calls which traded. The block-sized print in this contract went up for $2.83 in Thursday’s first half. With open interest of nearly 94,000 it’s far from obvious if we’re looking at an opening or closing position. 

  

Additionally, while the front couple months will fall prey to an overnight volatility crush, pricing of 26% to 27% for long-term premium, is very much in the realm of being fairly-priced with no overt advantage in this strategist’s opinion for either the buyer or seller. But with CEO Jaime Dimon optimistically discussing a dividend increase on CNBC this past Tuesday, if given the green light by Uncle Sam, the trader could be looking to capitalize on that event. “How” they capitalize though, could be a different story than you might realize.

  

  

Believe it or not, selling the call and buying stock is the more theoretically attractive play if the dividend is increased. In this type situation the call would actually lose value due to the math involved with the higher quarterly payout, all else being held equal. So, while many might opt for the “buy the call” approach if the belief is the crowd will react approvingly of such measures; as shown above and without tweaking a potentially overvalued call, our risk graph shows us how to really “buy right” or at least buy a bit better.

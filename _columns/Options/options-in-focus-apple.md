Index capitalization champion and IBD 50 constituent **Apple**  ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is seeing above-average option activity in late Thursday trade. Given Friday marks expiration for the July contract, some of Apple's near two-fold, 500,000 plus tally might be taken with a grain of salt. However, with the daily chart revealing a classic growth stock-oriented cup-with-handle base and earnings fast approaching on the evening of July 24, there's undoubtedly some incentive for investors looking to hedge or speculate in ways not possible with a simple stock position are in the mix as well. 

  

Amidst the rapid-fire volume today, calls are finding favor over the puts by about a 2-to-1 margin. Concentrated pockets of activity in the July contract have occurred in the surrounding money July 610 and 615 calls. Volume of nearly 50,000 and 60,000 and existing open interest of just 21,500 and 14,800 suggest that despite the imminent finality of those contracts, traders aren't shying away from opening new positions and / or some likely scalping and of course, closing down of positions as well. 

  

As today's stock action ushers in the 610s first intrinsic close since last Monday, its delta has firmed to about 70 and barring a move below 610, will climb towards 100 and act as a stock substitute during the session. At the same time, pricing of $5.30 representing roughly $1.00 of time or extrinsic value will melt away. 

  

For long contract holders, that melt is a two way street. If the stock moves higher by more than $1, then the net market value of the call increases and bulls are or should be happy. If shares move lower, it's a lose-lose situation. First, the $1 is removed from the call's current pricing due to decay into the expiration event. Secondly and possibly more troubling, those bulls can expect to lose intrinsic value, currently worth $4.30, point for point down to 610 if shares were to decline on Friday.

  

Looking a bit further out to the Weeklys July contract which opened for trading today and represent Apple's purest earnings play with expiration next Friday, trading was also dominated by calls, though on much lesser volume levels with the 610 call the most prized on trading of 5,900 and the 615s seeing about 3,400 contracts. 

  

Going out one calendar week, the $1 of time premium has ballooned to $15.40 with the 610 strike call trading for $19.70. The very big difference here isn't so much a reflection of extra time on the calendar, but really that the period contains the earnings event, which typically acts as a catalyst on shares. As much, implieds are bid at 47%, about twice that of the expiring July contract and suggest an expected move of roughly 7.25% through expiration.

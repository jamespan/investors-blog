Covered calls are an extremely easy strategy for investors to use to get started with options. They are quite conservative and simple to understand. Let's take a look at Verizon stock as a current example.




Why Covered Calls?
------------------


Investors that sell or write a call option over a stock they own collect option premium for doing so.


This way, they can generate a higher income from the stock in excess of the dividend.Â **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)) already has a healthy dividend yield of 4.6%, so adding to that can be attractive.


As always, there is a trade-off for boosting this yield. Your capital gains are limited.


Here's how the covered call strategy works. One call option contract represents 100 shares, so investors can sell multiple call options depending on how much stock they own. If you own 100 shares of Verizon stock, you could sell one options contracts. The options sold are "covered" by your stock position.


Over time, covered calls have the potential to increase returns while also decreasing the volatility of a portfolio.


I love using this strategy on stable, blue chip companies like Verizon stock that have a high dividend yield.


Covered Call Options Trade For Verizon Stock
--------------------------------------------


Verizon stock has pulled back to the 54 level after getting as high as 58.91 recently.


It's a good defensive play if the market takes a breather from the recent Fed-induced rally. Especially if we see investors start switching to yield stocks rather than growth.


![Covered call verizon stock](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wOPTIONS-052620-198x300.jpg)Selling covered calls could enhance an already strong dividend yield for VZ stock.


For example, selling a July 55 call option for around 1.30 would generate $130 in premium per contract. That would increase the annualized yield of Verizon stock by 16.6%.


The 1.30 in premium received also gives a small buffer on the downside of 2.4%. If Verizon stock trades 2.4% lower between now and July 17, the covered call trade still breaks even.


The total capital at risk in the trade is $5,361 and if Verizon stock went to zero, that's how much the trade would lose. But that's a little less risk than just holding the stock by itself. You get a little income to reduce your cost basis.


Covered calls are a fantastic way to generate extra income for a position while also providing some downside protection. Of course the flip side is that should Verizon stock skyrocket, your participation is limited.


Verizon Stock Analysis
----------------------



Counting against Verizon stock is the fact that it's trading below the 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages. According to [IBD's Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-verizon-communications-vz.aspx), VZ stock ranks No. 3 in its industry group and the [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) at 72 and RS Rating at 64 are mediocre.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.


However, a covered call trade, when done correctly, can significantly enhance the yield from high dividend stocks.

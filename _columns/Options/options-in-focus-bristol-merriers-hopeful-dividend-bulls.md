It's not very often traders will see options in **Bristol-Myers** ([BMY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BMY)) in the top spot for unusual activity for S&P 500 component stocks. But once a quarter and like clockwork, the drug behemoth is likely to be at or near the top of this ranking as traders play the ex-dividend or "capture the dividend" game when conditions permit. 

  

The dividend play, which on occasion can be likened to stealing the dividend, is hands down a better strategy than simply collecting the payout via naked long stock. But as there's no free lunch on Wall Street and as we'll explain, due to the mechanics of the play, there are far from any guarantees in actually taking in the dividend using this strategy despite its seeming popularity.

  

In order to capture the dividend using a "dividend play" a trader will buy and sell the same deep in-the-money call contract in a negotiated trade and hope to walk away with unassigned short contracts while converting the same purchased contracts into long stock the evening before shares go "ex dividend." 

  

The impact of exercising and not receiving assignment on the same call may sound like a bit of hocus pocus but it boils down to having one's purchased and sold contracts turn into a buy-write...if one is lucky enough. Barring typically very small interest considerations, any captured dividend plays amount to profiting by the amount paid by the dividend with the risk of holding a buy-write at the strike, which went unassigned. 

  

To stand an actual chance at profiteering, the traded contract will need to possess heavy open interest. The point of this is so your short call is in a large contract pool in which some call owners might unwittingly not exercise their long call position. As for assigning the few and far between's mistake of not exercising, the Options Clearing Corp is in control of pulling out the randomly drawn winning short contract / unassigned contracts from the various deep call pools being played.

  

A second important key is making sure the corresponding put market is valued at less than the pending dividend. If a same strike put were trading for more than the pending dividend, a trader wanting to capture the dividend would simply be better off selling that put's larger premium. That would represent a definite and richer sale and maintain the same but non-guaranteed risk profile being played with the dividend spreads. 

  

In the end it's guaranteed you won't find the set up described above due to conversion / reversal arbitrage. On the other much more likely hand, it is very probable anyone other than a market maker and the most privileged large customers will find themselves with a decent-sized commission bill if they're involved with any real intentions playing dividend spreads such as the more than 750,000 played in BMY's January 25 call. Versus open interest of 27,000 and a real put market priced at $0.09 compared to the dividend payout of $0.34 per share â€” that seems all the more certain. What do you think?

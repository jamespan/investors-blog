From last week's all too confident or complacent show of support for the broader market with the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" stretching more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average, investors appear to be pulling another Britney Spears or "oops, they did it again" maneuver. 

  

With Tuesday's price action the VIX has stretched itself up to a high near 20%. Nominally, a reading of 20% doesn't mean much historically speaking, but relative to its short-term gyrations, the level does coincide with excessive fear in the market. 

  

Relative to our watched moving average, today's highs generated a differential of about 17.5% and above the 15% measure we use in determining when investor's collective sentiment has put the broader market at an extreme typically good for a bounce and perhaps something even larger like an intermediate low. 

  

As a contrary indicator, an overbought reading in the VIX like the one we're currently faced with, suggests the broader markets are oversold. Generally viewed as the most highly correlated, the S&P 500 also happens to have tested its 50-day simple moving average support the past two sessions while correcting about 3% over three days. 

  

So, what's a bull, bear or option hedgehog to do? One faster money strategy to capitalize on potential technical support, time decay and relatively elevated premiums would be positioning with a bull vertical on an ETF such as the **S&P 500**'s ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) or a large cap stock with a beta near 1.0. Readings of around 1.0 generally mean the stock follows or maybe forces the broader market to move in sync with its own technical footsteps. 

  

On that basis both **Google** ([GOOG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOG)) and **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) are relatively good choices. Google maintains a slightly weak beta of 0.92, which means its price performance, trails on a percentage basis by a small margin but generally moves in the same direction of the S&P 500. On the other hand, Apple tends to slightly outperform on both the upside and downside. 

  

Another bonus in positioning of this kind and with any of these instruments is all three are quite liquid. As much, execution and slippage risk in both entering and potential exiting are minimized. That said, the SPY is the most liquid of the three and also maintains one-point strike distances. In conjunction with the fact the SPY is "Mr. Market", though at times that distinction does seem to be awarded to the likes of an Apple; we personally like its apples better.

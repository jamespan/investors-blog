As a stock trader, have you ever found yourself in a position of feeling a bit bearish in the immediate future, while simultaneously not wanting to let go of a bullish stake in the market? For option traders long calls, this sort of outlook can serve as the basis for adjusting into a long calendar spread by selling an equal amount of shorter-term calls.

  

In selling a near-term call the trader reduces their net dollar exposure by the price of the call sold. For instance, if one were long an October call which had the benefit of increasing from a purchased price of $1 to $1.75 and the same strike September call was now trading for $1.00, the trader could adjust into the time spread for even money.

  

So, what's this do exactly for the trader? For starters, this time spread cuts down the position risk to $0.00 from $1.00. It also prevents open profits from potentially disappearing, though the use of a calendar in this manner does forfeit the opportunity to simply cash out for $0.75 and be free of any positioning. Given that sometimes bearish short-term concerns grow larger, that trade-off does deserve serious deliberation. Also, if wrong and shares continue to move higher, the reality is the long calendar, which maintains a wide profit profile, could nonetheless underperform the long and unadjusted call position.

  

Back to the potential positive benefits, the long call calendar also gains the Greek of positive theta. Instead of time decay doing possible daily damage to the long call as extrinsic value is removed from the call's value, the trader has the ability to collect premium by being short a call. Nearer to expiration, that contract will hold greater positive theta relative to the long call's negative theta value. The reason is its closer to either going out worthless or valued at parity and void of any time or extrinsic premium. With the September contract just on the cusp of its final 30 days of life, the long calendar has a potential added bonus for traders in this sort of position and looking to adjust.

  

What other profit perks might this position have? As a result of the call sale, directional risk from owning long deltas is largely neutralized and in keeping with the trader's bearish short-term forecast. Also, this type calendar is also long or positive vega and what's known as being long volatility risk. That's due the construction of owning the further out back month whose same strike contracts maintain larger vega per point values by virtue of having more time on the clock. Currently and with broader market's premiums just removed from five year lows, that's another variable not found with stock positioning, which can assist in making it through those occasion bumps in the road more profitably.

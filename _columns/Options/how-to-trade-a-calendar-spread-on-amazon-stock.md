**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) chopped a third of its market value since its November top. So are the days of making money in Amazon stock over? Think of this calendar spread as an income strategy that profits with time decay. 




Calendar Spread Setup For Amazon Stock
--------------------------------------


A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Usually, this is done with monthly options, but it can also be done with weekly. Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they use puts.


In today's example, we'll look at a calendar spread trade on Amazon stock.


Amazon stock is trading around 2480. If we set up our calendar spread using that strike price, it gives the trade a neutral outlook.


Selling the May 20 call option with a strike price of 2480 will generate around $10,520 in premium. That's our shorter-term option.


Then we buy an option further out, in this case the June 17 call option at the same 2480 strike. The premium cost approximately $15,550.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $5,030 per spread. This is also the most the trade can lose.


Trade Changes With Implied Volatility
-------------------------------------


The estimated maximum profit is $6,800, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if AMZN stock remains around 2480 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay faster than the bought option. This allows the trade to be closed for a profit without Amazon stock needing to go up in price.



The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 2310 and 2680. It's an estimate because these also change slightly depending on changes in implied volatility.


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


Managing The Trade
------------------


For a trade like this, I would set a profit target of 30% set a stop loss if Amazon stock breaks through either 2310 or 2680.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Amazon stock is ranked No. 4 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 42, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 83 and a dismal [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 28.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

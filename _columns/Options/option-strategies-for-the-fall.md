The frequently fearsome fall months are approaching and many investors are contemplating what to do. They may worry that they are too heavily invested in equities, yet they may be reluctant to sell because of how well stocks have performed recently.

  

Is it possible to own stocks without assuming all of the attendant risk? The answer is a resounding, "Yes!" This article will discuss two option strategies that may help investors get the best of both worlds â€” keeping your stocks and limiting risk at the same time.

  

**Protective Puts Introduced**

  

Just like homeowner's insurance protects a house, put options can be purchased to protect stocks. A put option, remember, gives its owner the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at a specific price (the "strike price") until the expiration date. An XYZ December 70 Put, for example, gives its owner the right to sell 100 shares of XYZ stock at $70 per share at any time until the expiration date in December. The term protective put refers to the purchase of puts on a share-for-share basis with owned stock.

  

**Protective Puts: The Trade-offs**

  

There are two positive aspects of protective puts. First, risk is truly limited, because no matter how far a stock price might fall, the put owner has the right to sell at the strike price of the put. Second, if the stock rises, there is no upside limit on the profit potential of owning the stock. The negative aspects are the cost and the resulting increase in the break-even point. Also, the protection has an expiration date.

  

**Protective Puts: Profit/Loss**

  

Graph 1 shows how, with XYZ trading at $72, the purchase of an XYZ 70-strike Put purchased at for $3 limits the risk to $5 per share. For simplicity, commissions are not included.

  

**Protective Puts: Subjective Considerations**

  

Protective puts offer relatively high-cost insurance, but they do not limit profit potential if the stock price rises. Protective puts should be purchased when an investor is bullish on a stock but nervous about "something." That "something" could be an upcoming earnings report or a government announcement. Remember the old saying, "cut your losses short and let your profits run?" Protective puts allow investors to stay in the market with limited risk during times that are perceived to be high-risk.

  

**The Collar Introduced**

  

Many investors like the risk-reducing aspect of the protective put, but they are concerned about the cost. The collar is a two-part option strategy that addresses that concern. The first part of a collar is a protective put. The second part is a *covered call*.

  

Covered calls are calls that are sold on a share-for-share basis against owned stock. In return for receiving a premium, the seller of a covered call assumes the obligation of selling the stock at the strike price at any time prior to the expiration date.

  

An example of a covered call is selling one XYZ December 80 Call when 100 shares of XYZ stock are owned. The seller of this call is obligated to sell the stock at $80 at any time prior to the December expiration date if an assignment notice is received. When used as part of a collar, the premium received from selling a covered call is used to reduce the cost of the protective put.

  

**Collars: The Trade-offs**

  

The advantage of a collar relative to a protective put is its lower net cost. The premium received from the covered call is used to pay for the protective put. The disadvantage of a collar is the limit it places on the stock's profit potential. The covered call establishes a ceiling on how much can be made from a price rise in the stock.

  

Graph 2 shows how, with XYZ trading at $72, selling an 80-strike call for $2 and purchasing a 70-strike put for $3 creates a collar that limits the total risk to $3 per share. It also limits profit potential to $7 per share.

  

**Protective Puts vs. Collars: Subjective considerations**

  

How does an investor looking to reduce risk decide between a protective put and a collar? First, make sure you understand the trade-offs of each strategy, and, second, consider the market forecast that justifies each one.

  

Protective puts offer relatively high-cost insurance, but they do not limit profit potential if the stock price rises. Protective puts should be purchased when an investor is bullish on a stock but "is nervous about something." That "something" could be an upcoming earnings report or a government announcement. Remember the old saying, "cut your losses short and let your profits run?" Protective puts allow investors to stay in the market with unlimited upside and limited risk during times that are perceived to be high-risk.

  

A collar offers relatively low-cost insurance, but a limit is placed on the stock's profit potential. Collars, therefore, should be used when an investor is bearish for the short term on a stock but is unwilling to sell the stock, perhaps for tax reasons or because the long-term forecast is bullish.

  

Given a short-term bearish forecast, the presence of the short call and the existence of the obligation to sell the stock must be addressed. After all, the short-term forecast could be wrong. Before a collar is established, a decision must be made as to when, and at what point, the call will be repurchased to close out the obligation. It is then necessary to have the discipline to follow through on that decision.

  

**Summary**

  

Protective puts and collars are insurance strategies with trade-offs. The protective put, for a cost, provides protection and leaves intact the unlimited profit potential of the stock. In contrast, the collar offers lower-cost protection but involves the obligation to sell the stock and, therefore, limits profit potential. One of these strategies may be appropriate if you think this fall could be one of those fearsome ones.

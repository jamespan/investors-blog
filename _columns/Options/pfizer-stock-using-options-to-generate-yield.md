With rates near zero, it is becoming increasingly difficult for investors to find yield. Thankfully with options we can trade strategies that are yield-based, such as covered calls. Let's take a look at Pfizer stock.




Covered calls are a simple options strategy for beginners. They are quite conservative and easy to understand for those that are familiar with owning stocks.


Investors that sell a call option over a stock they own collect option premium for doing so.


This way, they can generate a higher yield from the stock in excess of the dividend. The trade-off for this higher yield is that the capital gains are limited.


One call option contract represents 100 shares, so investors can sell multiple call options if they have a particularly large stock holding.


Over time, covered calls have the potential to increase returns while also decreasing the volatility of a portfolio. With rates near zero, this can be an attractive strategy for investors trying to generate extra yield from their portfolio.


I particularly like using this strategy on stable, blue chip companies that have a high dividend yield.


Pfizer Stock: Covered Call
--------------------------


**Pfizer** ([PFE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE)) stock is currently the most oversold Dow Jones Industrial stock with an RSI of 35.83.

PFE stock is a good defensive play due to it's low beta and high dividend yield, which is currently around 4.7%. This yield can be further enhanced by selling covered calls.


For example, an August 33 call option can currently be sold for around $1.30 which would generate $130 in premium per contract and increase the annualized yield by 27.66%.


The $1.30 in premium received also gives a small buffer on the downside of 3.94%. That means Pfizer stock could trade 3.94% lower between now and August 21 and the covered call trade would still break even.


The total capital at risk in the trade is $3,169 and if Pfizer stock went to zero, that's how much the trade would lose.


Covered calls are a fantastic way to generate extra income for a stock holding while also providing some downside protection.


Counting against the stock is the fact that it is trading below the 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages. PFE stock is currently ranked 13th in its group here at IBD with a Composite Rating of only 41 (of a best 99) and an RS Rating of just 27.


Weigh The Pros And Cons
-----------------------


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.


However, a covered call trade, when done correctly, can significantly enhance the yield from high dividend stocks.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

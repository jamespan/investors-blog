This is the seventh and final article in a series on volatility. The goal of this series is to clarify the different meanings of the term volatility and to discuss its many possible uses, including describing stock price action, evaluating option prices, choosing option strategies, and forecasting the market. Option traders should strive to gain an accurate understanding of volatility — and its many uses — because volatility affects option prices, trading decisions and risk analysis.

  

This article summarizes the important points of the previous articles.

  

**The Concept of Volatility**

  

"Volatility" is price change without regard to direction, which can be confusing to traders who think that "up is good and down is bad." With volatility, it is the percentage change that matters, so a 1 percent price rise is equal in volatility terms to a 1 percent price decline.

  

The volatility of a particular stock's price action is derived from a series of daily closing prices. The daily percentage changes are computed, and then the standard deviation of those percentage changes is calculated. This standard deviation is referred to as the historical volatility of a stock's price.  The stated volatility percentage is the annual standard deviation of stock price movement.

  

Volatility makes it possible to compare the price fluctuations of the same stock during different time periods, and volatility makes it possible to compare the price fluctuations of two stocks regardless of a difference in price level. Volatility also makes it possible to compare past stock price fluctuations to price fluctuations that are forecast by the options market.

  

From statistics about normal distributions (bell-shaped curves), approximately 68% of all outcomes occur within one standard deviation of the mean; approximately 95% of all outcomes occur within two standard deviations of the mean; and approximately 99% of outcomes occur within three standard deviations.

  

**Implied Ranges**

  

The stated volatility percentage is the standard deviation of price movement over one year, but price-range probabilities for one year are not useful to short-term traders. So here is a formula that converts the stated volatility — the annual standard deviation — to a period of time chosen by the trader:

  

Standard Deviation for n days = Stock Price x Volatility x square root of time  
Where square root of time =   
square root of n days / square root of days per year 

  

The statistics of volatility are a good starting point for traders, because the stock price has a 33% chance (approximately) of closing beyond one standard deviation at expiration. Consequently, a stock price change equal to one-standard deviation is a realistic target for the stock to reach. A trader still has to get the direction right, and there is still the risk that a particular time period will be one of the two-thirds when the stock price does not close beyond the one-standard deviation level. 

  

**Probabilities**

  

In addition to the probability that a stock price will close within a stated range at expiration, the probabilities revealed by volatility also indicate the chances that a stock price will reach — or touch — a given level at some time prior to expiration. Here are some of the most commonly used probabilities derived from volatility:

  

1. At expiration, 68% chance underlying will close between 1 SD up and 1 SD down  
2. At expiration, 95% chance underlying will close between 2 SD up and 2 SD down  
3. At expiration, 99% chance underlying will close between 3 SD up and 3 SD down  
4. Prior to expiration, 99% chance underlying will touch 0.5 SD, up or down  
5. Prior to expiration, 54% chance underlying will touch 1 SD, up or down  
6. Prior to expiration, 22% chance underlying will touch 1.5 SD, up or down  
7. Prior to expiration, 7% chance underlying will touch 2 SD, up or down  
8. Prior to expiration, 58% chance underlying will close beyond 1 SD after touching 1SD  
9. Prior to expiration, 14% chance underlying will touch 0.5 SD both up and down

  

Probabilities derived from volatility can help traders in a number of ways. They can help in setting price targets for new trades. They can give a trader a completely dispassionate probability that something really good — or really bad — can happen. Traders can also compare their personal level of confidence to the unemotional percentage chances provided by volatility. The information probabilities provide must be balanced against subjective information that traders use in every trading decision.

  

**Implied Volatility**

  

Implied volatility is the level of volatility that explains the market price of an option. Calculating implied volatility involves taking the five known inputs to the options pricing formula plus the market prices of the call and put, which are also known, and then solving for the level of volatility. Essentially, the options pricing formula is worked in reverse by taking a known output (an option's market price) and solving for an unknown input (volatility).

  

The level of implied volatility, by itself, is of little value in making option trading decisions. However, the current level of implied volatility can be compared to levels in the recent past. It can also be compared to levels during similar situations in the past, such as immediately before or after earnings announcements. And it is these comparisons that can be helpful in making option trading decisions and selecting option strategies.

  

**Impact of Changing Implied Volatility**

  

The important point for options traders is that three inputs to the options pricing formula — stock price, time to expiration and implied volatility — can change enough to meaningfully impact the price of an option. The other three inputs — strike price, interest rate and dividends — do not change or have an insignificant impact if they do change.

  

The notion that changing implied volatility can change a trader's preference for one option over another is especially important for traders who trade options around earnings reports; because it is around earnings reports that implied volatility can change dramatically.

  

**Implied Volatility Around Earnings Reports**

  

A trader who is learning about the potential impact of changing implied volatility on the profitability of options strategies near earnings reports might reasonably ask, "What is a 'high' level of implied volatility? And what is a 'low' level?" Fortunately, the Chicago Board Options Exchange in conjunction with i-Volatility.com offers a free tool — the Volatility Optimizer — for tracking levels of implied volatility.com.

  

**Summary**

  

Option traders need to make three-part forecasts when analyzing options strategies. From the day that an options trade is established to the day it is closed, the stock price and time to expiration will change and impact the option price. Implied volatility might also change enough to impact the option price. Options traders, therefore, must gather information about volatility, both historical and implied and incorporate that information into trading decisions. Realistic forecasts based on historical information and experience can lead to successful trading. Knowledge about volatility can be an important part of that historical information.

**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is putting in a nice series of higher highs above rising 21- and [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/).




With the tech sector looking particularly strong, today we're looking at a bull call spread on Amazon stock.


A bull call spread is a bullish debit spread that is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to the August expiration, a 125-strike call option was trading around $6.45 on Friday, and the 130 call was around $4.55.


Maximum Profit $310 On Spread Trade
-----------------------------------


Buying the 125 call and selling the 130 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $190 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). The maximum potential profit would be $310 (the difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).



A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if Amazon stock closes below 125 on Aug. 18, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $190 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 130. So no matter how high Amazon stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $310.


The break-even price for the trade is equal to the long call strike plus the premium, which in this case would equal 126.90.


When To Cut Losses On Amazon Stock Trade
----------------------------------------


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 113, I would consider closing early for a loss.


According to the IBD Stock Checkup, Amazon stock is ranked No. in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 80, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 42 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90.


A [bull call spread trade](https://www.investors.com/research/options/bullish-option-idea-in-broadcom-stock-a-new-ibd-50-member-could-return-485/) on **Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)) discussed May 15 worked well and can be closed for almost the full profit.

Options investors are sending a clear signal that they see a larger-than-average move in **Netflix**'s ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) shares following its earnings report. The direction? Well, that's a bit cloudier.








The streaming-media service provider is set to report third-quarter results after Tuesday's close. Options prices imply an 11% change in the share price the day after the report. Over the last eight quarters Netflix shares have moved 8.1% on average, with rallies outnumbering sell-offs by a 5-to-3 ratio.


About 28% of total open interest is scheduled to expire Friday with the biggest bets split fairly evenly between the $340 strike calls and puts, signaling that investors are divided on what the earnings report will deliver. Current implied volatility is close to 131 vs. a three-month historical average of around 43, placing it in the 88th percentile over the last year.


Netflix shares rose as much as 1.8% ahead of the earnings report, leaving them up more than 75% in 2018.


Options As Protection
---------------------


Some investors may be using options to protect the year-to-date gains for the world's largest paid online TV service, while others may be looking for a rally, considering that its stock has fallen almost 20% since late June.

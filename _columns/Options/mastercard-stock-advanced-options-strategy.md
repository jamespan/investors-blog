Today I want to take a look at **Mastercard** ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) stock, which took a beating mid-last week when it dropped over 8%, but has since stabilized.




The option strategy I'm looking at is a diagonal put spread, which is an advanced option strategy because it utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.


The trade I'm looking at is selling a Nov. 20-expiring put with a 270 strike price and buying a Dec. 18-expiring 260 put.


As of Friday's close, the November put for Mastercard could be sold for around $5.40 and the December put could be bought for $6.45.


The net cost on the trade would only be $105 per share and that is the most the trade could lose on the upside.


The risk on the trade is on the downside with a potential maximum loss of $1,105. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread (10) multiplied by 100 and adding in the cost of the trade (105).


Mastercard Stock Strategy's Profit Zone
---------------------------------------


The maximum potential gain is around $740, which would occur if Mastercard stock closes right at 270 on Nov. 20. The trade has a nice profit zone in between 257 and 311.


Aiming for a return of around 10%-15% makes sense and I would set a similar stop loss.


The image below shows the payoff diagram at expiration (blue line) and an interim date of Nov. 11 (purple).

The initial trade set up has a delta of 2, meaning the position is roughly equivalent to owning two shares of Mastercard stock. Note that this delta number can change significantly as the stock starts to move.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Netflix stock had a strong day yesterday as tech leaders continue to show resilience. One way to take advantage of a potential price move using options is with a bullish calendar spread.




Netflix Stock Calendar Spread
-----------------------------


**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) is highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/ibd-university/find-evaluate-stocks/exclusive-ratings/) of 97, an EPS Rating of 97 and an RS Rating of 77.


Holding above a rising 50-day moving average and breaking above the November and December highs is a good sign the stock might be ready to make a run toward the 540-550 level. Netflix stock also recently joined [SwingTrader](https://www.investors.com/product/swingtrader/?artProdLink=Swingtrader).


If you set up a bullish calendar spread right, you can cash in should Netflix stock get to that price.


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Traders with a price target of 550, could place the bullish calendar spread at that price. More bullish traders might prefer to place the spread at 560.


Selling the 550 call expiring Dec. 24 will generate around $430 in premium. Buying the Dec. 31 call at the same strike of 550 will cost around $680.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $250 per spread. This is also the most the trade can lose.


Profit And Loss Goals
---------------------


The estimated maximum profit is around $950, but that can vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if NFLX stock trades up to around 550, the calendar spread will increase, resulting in a net profit.


A bullish calendar spread is a good way to gain some upside exposure on a stock without risking too much if it doesn't work.


The ideal scenario is a rise up to 550 around Dec. 24 with very little change in implied volatility.


In terms of risk management, I would close the trade if NFLX stock dropped back below 500. That would suggest it might need more time.


**PayPal** ([PYPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PYPL)) is showing similar strength and would be another candidate for this type of bullish option strategy.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

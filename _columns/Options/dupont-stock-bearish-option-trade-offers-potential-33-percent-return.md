DuPont stock is looking quite bearish since hitting resistance at the 200-day moving average, and on Wednesday broke down below the 20-day moving average.




A quick check of the IBD Ratings shows that **DuPont** ([DD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DD)) has a very weak [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 39 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 27.


With such a weak outlook, DuPont stock could be a good candidate for a bearish option trade called a bear call spread.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiration.


On DuPont stock, a bear call spread could be set up using the 55 strike price as the shorter-term call and the 60 strike as the longer-term call.


As of Wednesday, the August 55 call could be sold for around $2.30 and the 60 call could be bought for around $1.05 resulting in a net premium of $1.25 per contract for anyone willing to sell this spread.


Maximum Risk On Bear Call Spread $375
-------------------------------------


The maximum profit on the trade would be $125 per contract with a maximum risk of $375.



The spread would achieve the maximum 33.33% profit if DuPont closes below 55 on Aug. 21. In that case, the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the premium seller to keep the $125 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if DuPont stock closes above 60 on Aug. 21, which would see the premium seller lose $375 on the trade.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


The break-even point for the bear call spread is 56.25. That's calculated as the short call strike of 55 plus the $1.25 option premium per contract. Keep in mind that due to the bid-ask spread, you may not be able to get filled at these prices.


Setting Loss Limits
-------------------


For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss of 25% of capital at risk, so around $95. Otherwise, if DuPont broke back above the 20-day moving average at around 53, I would also consider closing the trade early.

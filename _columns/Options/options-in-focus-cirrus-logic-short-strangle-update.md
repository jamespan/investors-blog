IBD 50, No. 4 ranked **Cirrus Logic**  ([CRUS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRUS)) is atop more than a few radars this morning after the specialized chip manufacturer issued above-views sales guidance which powered shares aggressively higher. One class of trader that's on the wrong side of Tuesday's outsized stock gain are those option strategists entering the day short the expected move through a short vega / gamma position like the at-the-money August strangle. 

  

Ahead of the earnings release we discussed how Cirrus implieds in the mid-90s for its August contracts was richly priced compared to underlying statistical volatility in the high 40s to 50s and implied trading range lows of the past couple months near 50%. Through expiration, the pricing suggested a 68% or one standard deviation chance shares of CRUS would remain within 20.5% of its stock price near 29.50.

  

The downside to trying to fade and capture the fairly stiff-looking premiums was, as it turns out, to the upside and courtesy of an abnormally large price gap in the stock in relation to the sold premium. As noted yesterday, "if real life deviates from the theoretical and shares of CRUS make for less continuous-looking stock hedges / scalps against the short strangle, any of today's edge is going to be replaced by tomorrow's prospect of the trader facing less theoretical risks and real world open losses."

  

  

So, how's that all look? Above we're comparing a short ATM August 31 / 28 strangle for $3.50 versus an adjustment of flattening out the strategy's accumulated short deltas with the purchase of 80 shares. With the stock bought, the trader has used up most of his hedge ammo at less certain and discreet intervals, which measured well outside the expiration dated expected move, as well as the daily stock forecast of about 6%. The latter is calculated using the annualized 95% IV and breaking it down into a one day measure by dividing it by the square of 256 calendar days or 16.

  

Without the stock hedge, the short strangle maintains considerable upside risk as the position is in effect short the 31 call. The risk graph confirms that as we can see how losses basically pile up point for point with a move higher in CRUS. On the other hand, the adjustment rids the trader of 80% of that directional risk. But is that a good thing? Not entirely. 

  

More alarming is the negative impact the long stock hedge has on the position if shares of CRUS pullback in the coming days. We can see that until the day of expiration, there's no real benefit to having made the adjustment. In fact, a sharp reversal back into the former max profit zone between the strikes would cause even larger losses compared to profitability for the short strangle. Net, net, with no advantage to staying in the position if CRUS rallied further and no immediate or imminent benefit to staying the course if shares were to back and fill over the next several days, we'd say theoretically this illustrates a decent real world situation where taking the loss and moving on makes sense enough.

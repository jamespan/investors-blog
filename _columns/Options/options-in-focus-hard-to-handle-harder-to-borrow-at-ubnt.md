The term "value" can be highly subjective when it comes to investing, but synthetic relationships with options typically remove any associated emotion involved with forming that determination. However, when a stock becomes hard-to-borrow or "HTB", the interpretation of "value" does manifest itself into prices in a very visible manner and something, which needs to be strongly considered by traders before establishing a potential position.

  

A very good illustration of this is IBD 50 constituent **Ubiquiti Networks** ([UBNT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBNT)). According to Yahoo Finance, the stock maintains short interest of nearly 62% and short-to-cover ratio of about 15 days. In truth, as that reading is from a couple weeks back, those numbers may be slightly different after today's slippery -17.4% earnings-related fallout. But given what we're seeing at the end of the day in the likes of the near-the-money May 30 strike, some bears may have taken some profits, but bulls aren't out of the woods just yet by that measure.

  

Specifically, with calls priced for $1.00 mid-market and puts at $2.85 andÂ both sporting $0.20 wide bid / ask spreads and shares at 29, the synthetic long call using long stock plus the long put is priced for $1.85. Compared to the $1.00 price per contract on the real call, traders might see the $0.85 as something to pounce on. Maybe.

  

What this pricing also unequivocally tells us is the risk of getting called in on a short stock hedge is a very real concern. As much, a synthetic long call equivalent like our example commands a premium as this trader, when adjusting with stock, never needs to worry about shorting shares and put into that undesirable predicament; and as would be the case for the long call holder maybe looking to hedge some delta risk at a later date with the use of short stock.

  

Secondarily and when it comes to a call looking cheap in relation to its synthetic equivalent of the same strike and other surrounding calls, a trader could be seeing a hard-to-borrow situation. When shares are "HTB" or impossible to short, calls can quite often trade at a theoretical discount to puts as the natural hedge to reduce delta or directional risk is with short stock which is unavailable to borrow short.

  

When shares to short can't be located by one's broker, traders wishing to get long or short deltas without this meddlesome restriction will trade long puts in conjunction with long stock. This action or demand brings increased value to the puts, which goes beyond theoretical considerations and into the realm of real world applications.

  

Depending on those traders' directional outlook or fresh positions after establishing this long put / long stock combination; he or she can adjust deltas effortlessly by selling some existing long stock inventory. That's in stark contrast to the long call trader who at the same time may be quickly realizing his or her "bargain" is less than they bargained for when needing a quick hedge.

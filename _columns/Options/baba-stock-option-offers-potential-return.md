When thinking about internet retailers, the first name that comes to most people's minds isÂ **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)).




However, it is actually a Chinese giant that is ranked No. 1 in the internet retail group at Investor's Business Daily.


Along with being No. 1, **Alibaba** ([BABA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BABA)) has some impressive ratings: a Composite Rating of 99, an EPS Rating of 99 and an RS Rating of 89.


BABA stock looks very strong technically, with recent declines bouncing right at the 200-day moving average.


It's hard to see such a strong stock dropping below a price of 200, so let's look at a how a bull put spread might be constructed. Keep in mind that Alibaba reports earnings before the open Friday, and a poor report could spark a sell-off in the stock.


As a reminder, a bull put spread is a defined-risk strategy, so you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


This type of trade will profit if BABA stock trades sideways or higher, and even sometimes if it trades slightly lower. So far we've looked mostly at short-term bull put spreads, but today I want to look at a longer-term setup to illustrate the difference.


BABA Bullish Option Trade
-------------------------


With BABA stock trading around 217, if we go out to August expiration, we can sell a 190 put and buy a 180 put and still generate a nice amount of option premium.


Selling this spread would generate roughly $180 in premium, with a maximum risk of $820.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wOPTIONS052120-300x170.jpg)If the spread expires worthless that would be a 21.95% return in around three months provided BABA stock is above 190 at expiration, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the premium seller to keep the $180 option premium.


By trading a longer-term put spread we can place the spread further away from the current price, giving us greater margin for error. The trade-off is that the return on an annualized basis is lower.


The maximum loss would occur if BABA stock closes below 180 on Aug. 21, which would see the premium seller lose $820 on the trade.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is $188.20, which is calculated as $190 less the $1.80 option premium per contract.


Set A Stop Loss At These Levels
-------------------------------


On the chart, I would be watching for a break of the 50- and 200-day moving averages. If those levels break, I would look to close the trade early to try to limit losses.


Otherwise, another good rule of thumb is to limit the loss at two times the premium received, which in this case would be $360.


Sticking to this stop loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.


If you're new to options, please note that this trade could lose 100% if BABA stock takes a big tumble, so it's important to understand the risks as well as the potential profits. Make sure to check with your financial advisor before making any investment decision.

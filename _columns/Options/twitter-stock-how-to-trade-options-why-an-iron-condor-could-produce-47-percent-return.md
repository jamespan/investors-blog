Twitter stock is currently showing an implied volatility percentile of 63%. This means volatility in the stock is currently higher than 63% of the readings seen in the past 12 months.




Iron condors can offer a great trade when volatility is high and you are expecting sideways price action.


Let's look at an example using **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)). The iron condor serves as a combination of a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/fedex-stock-offers-bullish-option-trade/) and a [bear call spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tsla-stock-bear-call-spread/).


The idea with the trade? Profit from time decay while expecting that the stock won't move too much in either direction.


Twitter Stock: How To Open An Iron Condor
-----------------------------------------


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the April 16 expiry, we could sell the 60-strike-price put and buy the 55-strike-price put. That spread can be sold for around 90 cents per pair of option contracts. Multiply 90 cents by 100 shares to receive $90 in premium.


Then you have to construct the bear call spread. Place the trade by selling the 67 call and buying the 72 call. This spread can be sold for around 70 cents.


In total the iron condor in Twitter stock will generate around $1.60 in premium, or $160 for the 100-share contract. The trade generates a profit if TWTR stays between 58.40 and 68.60. You can calculate this by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.



Why The Risk Is Limited
-----------------------


As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is $340 ($500 minus the $160 received in premium per option contract).


Therefore, if we take the premium ($160) divided by the maximum risk ($340), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 47%.


That's a very nice return. It would be great if things were as easy as that.


However, iron condors generally need some management as the trade progresses and the stock starts to move in either direction. That takes a bit of skill and experience. So, this isn't a strategy for beginners. But the iron condor is a fantastic strategy once you get the hang of it.


For a trade like this, I would close the trade if Twitter stock broke through 60 on the low side, or 67 on the high side.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

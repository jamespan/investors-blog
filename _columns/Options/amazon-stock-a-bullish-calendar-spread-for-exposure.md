**Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) perked up recently as it had a decisive break above its 21-day moving average. Granted, the reaction to the [hot inflation report](https://www.investors.com/news/economy/cpi-inflation-rate-is-sliding-but-this-is-what-matters-for-the-fed-and-dow-jones/) tempered enthusiasm for buying the megacap. But if the weakness is short-lived, a calendar spread is a cheap way to gain upside exposure in Amazon stock using options.




Calendar Spread Example With Amazon Stock
-----------------------------------------


A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Let's just use the option prices for Amazon stock yesterday to demonstrate how it works.


Yesterday, Amazon stock closed around 136. I was looking at a bullish calendar spread at 150, just above its August highs.


Selling the Oct. 21 150 call option generated around $170 in premium, and buying the Nov. 18 150 call cost around $415.


That resulted in a net cost for the trade of $245 per spread. With a calendar spread, the cost of the trade is also the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is a little trickier. Based on this Amazon stock trade yesterday, it was around $400 but varies depending on changes in implied volatility.


Managing The Trade
------------------


The idea with the trade is that if AMZN stock trades up to around 150, the calendar spread increases in value resulting in a net profit.


The break-even prices for the trade yesterday were with Amazon stock trading around 140 and 163. However, given today's action, it might not be the time to enter into bullish trades.


I was originally looking at a drop below 125 for Amazon stock to close the trade if it was started at yesterday's prices. It nearly got there early in the trading session today.


A rally to 150 was an area I set for profit-taking. But again, since it is a directional trade, the uncertainty of the trend might warrant holding off for now.


One of the benefits of the option trade is that you get upside exposure at a lower cost. This option position for Amazon stock yesterday started with a delta of 10. That means the exposure is roughly equivalent to being long 10 shares of AMZN stock as opposed to a full contract amount of 100 shares.


With Amazon stock dropping today, the lower exposure of the option trade helps soften the blow. Even the 5% drop today led to less than a $100 loss for the trade.


Please remember that options trading is risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stock ripped higher yesterday on the back of a well-received earnings announcement.




The stock gapped up and finished 16.85% higher on the day with a low of 556.86 and a high of 593.29.


I'm thinking NFLX stock might spend the next few days stuck inside the range set yesterday and an iron condor is an option strategy that benefits from range bound stocks.


Let's take a look at how a short-term iron condor on NFLX stock might look. An iron condor consists of a bull call spread combined with a bear put spread.


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Jan. 29 expiry, we could place the put spread at 555-550 by selling the 555 put and buying the 550 put. That spread traded yesterday for around $0.95.


Then the bear call spread which could be placed by selling the 600 call and buying the 605 call. This spread can be sold for around $1.20.


NFLX Stock Iron Condor Is An Option Selling Strategy
----------------------------------------------------


In total, the iron condor will generate around $2.15 in premium. Because the iron condor collects option premium and benefits from time decay, it falls into the group of strategies that are considered net option selling.


The profit zone is if Netflix stock stays between 552.85 and 607.15. This is calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.



As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 — 2.15 x 100 = $285 Therefore, if we take the premium divided by the maximum risk, this iron condor trade has the potential to return 75.44%.


That's a very nice return and it would be great if things were as easy as that.


However, iron condors generally need some management as the trade progresses and the stock starts to move in either direction.


That takes a bit of skill and experience, so this isn't a strategy for beginners, but they are a fantastic strategy once you get the hang of them.


Short-term strategies like this can move quickly and be difficult to adjust.


However, if NFLX stock stays within a tight range for the next week, this iron condor trade could do quite well.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

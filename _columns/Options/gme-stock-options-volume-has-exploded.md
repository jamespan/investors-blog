**GameStop** ([GME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GME)) stock jumped 92% yesterday as call option volume went through the roof. GME stock even hit a price of $223 in after-hours trading.




The wallstreetbets Reddit crowd have really ramped this stock through aggressive call option buying which is putting huge amounts of pressure on other market participants.


To put the action into perspective, GME stock option traders exchanged nearly 1.5 million call option contracts yesterday and only 178,000 put options. Tech behemoth **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) which released earnings yesterday traded only 767,000 call option contracts.


The hot money has certainly been running into GME stock this week, but the question is how long will it last?


The GME option contract with the highest volume was the Jan. 29 200 strike call option which traded over 108,000 contracts. This contract traded for a low price of $1.75 around 10:30 to a high of $22.00 around 3:35. Some phenomenal gains were presumably made by the Reddit investing crowd.


**AMC Entertainment** ([AMC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMC)) appears to be another stock showing targeted call buying with 882,000 call option contracts traded yesterday compared to 100,000 puts. AMC stock was up a measly 12.22% yesterday.


Trading like this is more akin to gambling than investing but it sure is fun to watch even if it's from the sidelines.


GME stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 71, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 7 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 99. AMC stock has a Composite Rating of 32, an EPS Rating of 3 and an RS Rating of 67.


This is hardly what you would expect to see from a growth stock seeing these types of crazy gains. Clearly there is something else at play here.


Be careful out there.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

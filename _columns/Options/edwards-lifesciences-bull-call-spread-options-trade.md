Shares of **Edwards Lifesciences** ([EW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=EW)) are outperforming, with its [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/) near all-time highs.




As Edwards Lifesciences stock trades in a [cup-with-handle pattern](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/), investors who are bullish on the company but also believe shares may hit resistance near the 131.83 buy point can use a bull call spread to express this view.


In constructing a bull call spread, an investor buys a call option while also selling a higher-strike call option. In the case of Edwards Lifesciences, investors can consider a bull call spread by buying a 125 call while selling the 130 call on the May 20 expiration.


This trade can currently be placed for a debit of around $1.15 per share. This also coincides with the maximum loss of $115 an investor will experience if a block of 100 shares are under $125 on expiration.


The maximum profit is the width of the strikes minus the debit paid. In this case, the calculation is 5-1.15 x 100 = $385. Investors will realize this maximum profit if Edwards Lifesciences stock trades above $130 on expiration. Therefore, if shares are trading around the potential resistance of all-time highs by May 20, this trade will experience a full profit.


Edwards Lifesciences Earnings Next Week
---------------------------------------


Edwards Lifesciences is a medical technology company specializing in heart valve replacement. The company — [today's IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/ew-stock-why-the-easing-covid-pandemic-could-stoke-a-renewed-surge/) — will report first-quarter earnings on April 26. Analysts expect EPS of 57 cents and revenue of $1.3 billion.


The options market is currently implying a 4.9% move on Edwards Lifesciences stock with the earnings event. The stock has previously moved on average 4.5% on past earnings events.


Making an investment before a company's earnings is an added risk. Nevertheless by using a bullish call spread, investors can only lose the maximum of the debit paid. This can make a bull call spread an attractive options trade as opposed to simply buying shares.

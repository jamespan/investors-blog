Tesla stock has been on fire lately, rallying from 400 to 585 since being added to the S&P 500.




**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) is now about 32% above the 50-day moving average and an incredible 108% above the 200-day moving average.


While it would take a brave person to bet against Tesla stock, today I want to look at an option trade idea that will profit if Tesla consolidates around this level.


The trade can also make money if Tesla stock rallies a little bit, but not too much.


A broken wing butterfly using calls is a trade that can be set up with zero risk on the downside and a nice profit zone on the upside.


The catch is that there is risk on upside if Tesla stock makes a big move higher. So, this is a neutral to slightly bullish trade.


Very bullish traders would not enter this trade.


Broken Wing Trade With Tesla
----------------------------


Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on Tesla stock:


* Buy one Jan. 15 700 call at 36.40
* Sell two Jan. 15 720 calls at 32.10
* Buy one Jan. 15 760 call at 25.60


Notice that the lower strike call is 20 points away from the middle call and the upper call is 40 points away.


This broken wing butterfly trade will generate $220 in premium. There is no loss potential on the downside, the worst that can happen is all the calls expire worthless and the trader gets to keep the $220 premium.


On the upside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the width between the first two strikes (20) multiplied by 100 and subtracting the premium received (220).


That gives us 20 x 100 â€” 220 = $1,780


The maximum gain can be calculated as 20 x 100 + 220 = $2,220 although it's unlikely this amount would ever be achieved.


The ideal scenario for the trade is that Tesla stock stays below 700 until expiration.


The risk on the trade is that Tesla shoots significantly higher, particularly early in the trade. For that reason, bullish traders would prefer to look at a [vertical spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tesla-stock-could-return-69-percent-in-one-month-with-option-strategy/) or a straight [long call](https://www.investors.com/research/options/crowdstrike-stock-how-to-gain-leveraged-expsoure-with-a-long-call/).


Trade Works For Neutral To Slightly Bullish Views
-------------------------------------------------


For those with a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, a broken wing butterfly could be a nice way to trade Tesla stock.


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 15%, or around $265.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

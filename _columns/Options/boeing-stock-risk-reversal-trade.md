**Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) shot higher Monday on news that a coronavirus vaccine is proving to be effective. But does a bullish risk reversal trade for Boeing stock make sense?




Boeing closed above the 50-day moving average but failed to stay above the 200-day moving average. Boeing stock is also putting in a doji candlestick (a session in which the candlestick has an open and close that are virtually equal), which is a sign of indecision.


Traders who think good news on the coronavirus front will continue can take some bullish exposure on Boeing stock via an option trade called a risk reversal.


Risk reversals are bullish trades that involve selling an out-of-the-money put and using the proceeds to purchase an out-of-the-money call.


Let's take a look at how that might look on Boeing stock.


Boeing Stock: Risk Reversal Trade
---------------------------------


Going out to May expiration gives the trade plenty of time to work out. The May 21st 165 put can be sold for around $18 per contract.



Those proceeds can then be used to purchase a May 200 call option which was trading around $17.55 per contract Monday.


As the sold put is slightly higher than the bought call, the trader receives a credit into their account of $0.45 per contract or $45 in total.


However, don't go thinking this is the most the trade can lose. The 165 put has a total loss potential of $16,500 which would occur if BA stock went to zero.


The trade will initially perform similar to a long stock position and will profit as the stock rises, and suffer losses if the stock falls.


The risk reversal has a delta of 79 which means the combined position is roughly equivalent to owning 79 shares of Boeing stock.


At expiration, if Boeing stock is between 165 and 200, both options expire worthless and the trader makes a small $45 profit.


Larger profits at expiration will occur above a price of 200 and the higher the stock goes the better for this trade. There is no limit to the profit potential.


Weak Ratings
------------


Despite Monday's big price gain, Boeing stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of just 14 and an [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 17, so traders would need to weigh the risks of being bullish on a stock that has been underperforming for some time.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

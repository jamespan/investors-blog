Resort and casino stocks have been particularly hard hit this year, with not a single stock in the industry showing a positive year-to-date return.




In fact, the leading stock in the sector is **Studio City International** ([MSC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSC)), which is down more than 20% so far this year and is thinly traded.


As an option trader, when looking for bearish ideas, I want to be looking at weak and out-of-favor sectors.


I also want to look for companies with good option volume, so that generally means large-cap stocks. Out of the resort and casino stocks, **Las Vegas Sands** ([LVS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LVS)) has the highest market cap at $32.89 billion.


The next step would be to look at the charts and see if there is some bearish action, and that is certainly the case here.Â LVS stock is below the 20-, 50- and 200-day moving averages, and those averages are all trending lower.


There is also no sign of accumulation in the stock, so it seems to me that it is too early for a bottom. We've previously looked at [bear call spreads on stocks like **Wells Fargo**](https://www.investors.com/research/options/wells-fargo-stock-offers-potential-big-return-for-bearish-option-traders/) ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)), but this time let's take a look at a bear put spread.


A bear put spread is a debit spread, meaning that we need to pay the premium in order to open the trade.


If we place the bear put spread out-of-the-money we have a trade with low cost and a high reward potential if the stock drops.



On Las Vegas Sands stock, a bear put spread could be set up using the 40 strike as the long put and the 35 strike as the short put.


This trade would cost around $90 per contract with a maximum potential gain of $410.


To achieve the maximum profit, this trade would need the stock to drop 22.4% between now and expiration on June 19.


That's a pretty big drop, so I would consider this more of a lottery play, where we are only risking a little but need a very big move to see the full profit.


The break-even point for the bear put spread is 39.10 which is calculated as 40 less the 90-cent option premium per contract. Keep in mind that due to the bid-ask spread, you may not be able to get filled at these prices.


If LVS stock drops early in the trade it may be possible to make a profit at slightly higher prices.


At expiration, if LVS stock is trading above 40, the entire spread would expire worthless and the trade would lose 100%, or $90.


For a trade like this, I probably wouldn't bother with a stop loss. Either the trade works or it doesn't, so I would trade an appropriate position size in case I suffered the full 100% loss.

Call options offer investors a low-cost alternative to buying stock, but which call should you buy? And what are the risks? This article first reviews a textbook example of using call options as a stock substitute. Second, a real stock highlighted in [The Big Picture column on January 7](http://news.investors.com/investing/big-picture.htm), **CommVault Systems** ([CVLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CVLT)), is discussed.

  

**CALL OPTIONS AS A STOCK SUBSTITUTE — A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE**

  

The following example compares stock ownership and an at-the-money call option. Both strategies face the risk of a declining stock price, but the cash at risk with the call option is significantly lower.

  

Remember, the owner of a call option does not have the right to receive dividends or to vote in corporate affairs. Note also that the position in call options in this example represents only the amount of stock that is purchased, i.e., one call option for each 100 shares of the underlying stock.

  

Position 1:   
**Long Stock**Buy 100 XYZ @ $54 

  

  
Position 2:  
**Long At-the-Money Call Option**Buy 1 March 55-strike Call @ 2.25

  

It is obvious that the call option costs less than the stock, but compare the results under three different scenarios:

  

**Scenario 1: Stock Advances 20 Points at Expiration (March 15) —** With XYZ stock at $74 the stock owner has a paper profit of $2,000, or 37%, not including commissions. The call, however, rises to $19 (the stock price of $74 minus the strike price of $55) for a profit of $1,675, or 640% on the cost of the call. The call option profit is $3.25 per share less in absolute dollar terms, but the initial investment was 96% less ($2.25 per share versus $54 per share).

  

Assuming funds are available, the call can be exercised. Alternatively, the call can be sold. Exercising a call means that the stock is purchased at the strike price. After exercising, the former call owner becomes a stock owner and assumes the corresponding risk. If the call is sold, the tax consequences must be considered, and it is always best to consult a tax advisor in such matters.

  

**Scenario 2: Stock Price Unchanged at $54 at Expiration —** Assuming no dividends and no commissions, with the stock price unchanged, the stock owner breaks even. The 55 Call, however, expires worthless for a loss of $225 and 100% of the cost of the call plus commissions. Another consideration is that the call no longer exists. The stock, however, is still owned. Therefore, the possibility of a stock price rise exists, although the risk of a stock price decline also exists. 

  

**Scenario 3: Stock Declines 8% —** With XYZ stock at $49.70 (8% below $54), the stock owner who follows CAN-SLIM guidelines will be stopped out for a loss of $4.30 per share or $430, or 8% of the cost of the stock, not including commissions.  The 55 Call will also decline in price, but the option price and amount of loss will be determined by when the stock price trades at $49.70.

  

If XYZ stock declines to $49.70 within 10 days of its purchase, then the 55 Call with 65 days remaining to expiration will be trading at about $0.60, or 60 cents per share, for a loss of $1.65 per share, or about 75% of the cost of the call. The loss is less in dollar terms, a loss of $1.65 for the call versus $4.30 for the stock, but the loss is larger in percentage terms, 75% for the option versus 8% for the stock.

  

The more time it takes for the stock price to decline 8%, the lower the price of the 55 Call will be and the larger the loss. This happens because time erosion causes option prices to decrease a little every day. As a result, if it takes 60 to 70 days for the stock price to decline 8%, then the price of the 55 Call will be close to zero, and the loss incurred from purchasing the call will be very close to 100% as described in Scenario 2 above.

  

**Current Example — CVLT**

  

Commvault Systems gained attention in the [Your Weekly Market Review column by Vincent Mao on Friday, Jan. 4](http://news.investors.com/investing-your-weekly-review/010313-639265-corelogic-bouncing-back-from-october-dive.htm), after having advanced almost back to a 70.02 buy point from a rare ascending base cleared Dec. 18 in more than twice average trading volume. The stock has not had a down week in above-average trading volume since the week ended Oct. 26.

  

If you believe that CVLT's current price is a buying opportunity, then the options market gives you an opportunity to participate in the stock price rise you forecast at a fraction of the per-share investment required to purchase the stock.

  

With CVLT trading at 71.65 at the close on Friday, Jan. 4, the CVLT April 70 Call was offered at 7.10 per share. This call has a breakeven stock price of $77.10 (strike price of 70 + cost of the call of 7.10 = 77.10), so the stock price must rise to this point just to break even at expiration. However, the call should rise in price if CVLT rises in price in the near future. Also, above the break-even price at expiration, the call participates dollar for dollar in any stock price rise. The maxim possible risk is limited to the cost of the call no matter how much the stock price might fall. The likely risk is less than the maximum risk, however, because the call can be sold on any trading prior to the expiration date in April.

  

**Summary**

  

Purchasing calls as a stock substitute allows you to participate in the upside potential of a stock. The risk of buying calls is substantially lower in absolute dollars, but the percentage risk of capital invested is higher. Learning to use options involves mastering new dynamics, but many investors believe that learning to use options is worth the effort. Options offer strategy alternatives that have different risk-to-reward ratios, different break-even points, and potentially different stock-price ranges of profit and loss.

**Delta Air Lines** ([DAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DAL)) is [expecting strong growth in 2023](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/delta-stock-ibd-stock-of-the-day-set-to-take-off-on-air-travel-recovery/) as the travel market recovers. The stock was Wednesday's [IBD Stock of The Day](https://www.investors.com/category/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/).




DAL stock is above its 21-, 50- and 200-day moving averages and broke out Wednesday from a tight handle in its [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-lam-research-cup-with-handle-launched-75-percent-advance/).


While the chart looks good, there is still a lot of recession talk lingering, so some investors may prefer to use the options market to gain exposure to DAL stock.


One way to do that is via a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to the June expiration, a 40-strike call option was trading around $3.40 Wednesday, and the 45 call was around $1.35.


Maximum Return For Trade $295
-----------------------------


Buying the 40 call and selling the 45 call would create a bull call spread. The trade's cost would be $205 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). And the maximum potential profit would be $295 (the difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy. So if DAL stock closes below 45 on the June 16 expiration, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $205 premium paid.



Potential gains are also capped above 45, so no matter how high DAL stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $295.


The break-even price for the trade is equal to the long call strike plus the premium, which in this case would equal 42.05.


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below 38, I would consider closing early for a loss.


DAL Stock Ranked No. 1 In Its Industry
--------------------------------------


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), DAL stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 82 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/)of 81.


Delta Air Lines is due to report earnings in mid-April. So this trade would have earnings risk if held until then.

Options bets on stocks and exchange-traded funds are piling up around key deadlines in President Trump's trade crusade and at least one strategist doesn't think it's a coincidence.


Six of the 11 most-active contracts on the U.S. exchanges Tuesday had a June 29 expiration. That's a day before the Treasury Department is scheduled to propose restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S. It's also the last session before Congress can block renewal of a measure known as the trade-promotion authority, which provides for a yes-or-no vote by lawmakers on trade deals.


"It is expected that we will get a decent move into this date and this is keeping VIX supported below around 15," said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital LLC.


The Cboe Volatility gauge slid 8.1% on Tuesday to 15.92 after rising 26% on Monday as U.S. stocks posted the biggest decline since April. Among contracts that changed hands the most Tuesday were **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) June 29 call options with a strike price of $29 and $30 and June 29 $276 calls on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust.

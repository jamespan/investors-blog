It's been said after a growth stock loses that certain something with investors, the majority goes on to drop 70% or more from their highs. If so, it appears **VanceInfo Technologies**  ([VIT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VIT)) is in very good standing with historical trends. The once, not-so-long ago growth prospect has shed a bit more than 70% from its December 2010 highs near $41 to its current price a tad south of $11 a share.

  

I gather that some of those that drop 70% go on to drop 80%, 90% and maybe disappear off the radar altogether. Most however, don't. And in the case of a company like Vanceinfo Technology, which boasts global ventures, has been around for a couple decades and still sports a market cap of around $480 million. My guess is this isn't going to turn into a complete piece of phony baloney. 

  

For value oriented types like Warren Buffet who's in the news with his $5 billion preferred stock stake in **Bank of America**  ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)) Thursday and a guy who is said to sell puts to gain an even cheaper foothold in companies he wishes to position in, there's always that choice to consider. 

  

And for mortals like me that always seem to get in trouble when trying to be a bit too confident with open-ended risk that goes hand in hand with the likes of this kind of targeted purchase; there's the bull put vertical to consider. Verticals in general are type of spread that we've discussed a fair bit lately due to considerable market volatility, as well as implied volatility risk for both buyers and sellers of outright premium. 

  

The reality is VIT doesn't offer many choices to strategists agreeable on this kind of vertical. There are strikes all the way down to 2.5 but liquidity prevents a workable fill outside of using the 10 / 7.5 put combo. Also, when push comes to shove, traders would be looking at the choice of either September or October in which to position. As it stands not many traders are doing or likely even looking to pursue VIT with options, let alone a vertical. 

  

The quiet in VIT options stands in sharp contrast to Warren's Bank of America, which traded nearly 1.75 million contracts from its similar 60% decline since late last year. Of course with BofA, we're dealing with generous sponsorship from the Oracle of Omaha, its shares being a Dow component and the company still the country's largest bank holding company by assets according to the National Information Center. At the end of the day I'd personally rather go with the one not deemed too big to failâ€”though as of the close today, the situation remains simply "in-VIT-ing" with those waters not yet tested.

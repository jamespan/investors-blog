Shares of IBD 50 constituent **Chipotle Mexican Grill** ([CMG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CMG)) reported earnings after the market close this evening and dished out mixed profit and revenue figures. Earnings came in short of Street views by $0.02 on profits of $1.81 per share while revenues climbed by 23.7% and topped forecasts of $591.31 million with actual sales of $596.7 million. The company also announced it expects mid-single digit comparable restaurant sales growth. 

  

Not yet privy to Chipotle's conference call, which is still waiting in the wings, investors are taking early action by sending shares down about 2% in the after- hours session. While bears in the stock can count their profits tick-for-tick in shares, the same can't be said for traders positioning bearishly in CMG's options. 

  

In the Weeklys February contract which expires two days from now and what amounts to as the purest play on the earnings event, well-bid implieds of 95% translate into an expected move of 7.0% in shares through Friday with a confidence of 68% or 1 standard deviation. Tonight's 2% showing thus far, if its representative of Thursday's breakfast feeding, will mean strategies such as a carrying a long put or most bearish verticals, will be facing substantial losses.

  

  

Figure 1: Chipotle (CMG) -1x Weeklys Feb 370 Straddle 

  

Shown above, one potentially large winner will be those fast money types trading a delta neutral, short premium strategy like our illustrated -1 Weeklys February 370 straddle. Priced at $20.70 and 95% IV, the short gamma / short vega spread looks to benefit strongly from CMG if the profit-taking by investors remains more mild, like tonight, rather than red hot in its flavor. We've adjusted the risk graph to reflect for time decay or theta, as well as a volatility crush of 70% from 95% down into the high 20s.

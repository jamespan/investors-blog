The CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" hit sub 16% Wednesday and levels last seen in late April around the time the broader market topped and began its fairly stiff corrective move of about 9% in the S&P 500. But before you think of history needing an encore performance, the euphemistically called "Fear Gauge" is continuing to do a couple things right by bulls in the market. 

  

Confidence on the part of investors is a good thing. Complacency on the other hand isn't. When the VIX stretches or by more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average, conditions relatively speaking, are prone to a reversion or price move back towards its short-term moving average. In turn, investors can expect the broader market to move inversely lower. While this kind of "complacency signal" doesn't catch every top in the broader market, it's pretty darned good historically speaking. 

  

In conjunction with absolute price levels on the VIX daily or weekly charts, if we can come by some additional historical evidence of prices being extremely low or high or a slightly more technical read on the current situation; the VIX can be a valuable tool for investors in timing the market better than they might otherwise be able to do using other strategies such as counting distribution days, the health of market leaders and the likes.

  

Currently, what's striking about the current lows in the VIX compared to April's is the placement of the 10, 30 and 50-day simple moving averages aligning themselves to suggest the VIX could see lower prices yet before confident behavior grows too complacent and backfires on bulls in the broader market. With the March lows still 14% below at 13.66%, current levels near 16% still historically closer to normal than not and more than five years since we've experienced a real low volatility environment marked by single digits and the S&P 500 sporting a nice uptrend channel versus a decidedly more prone pattern back in April, we'll let the other trader pick tops for the time being.

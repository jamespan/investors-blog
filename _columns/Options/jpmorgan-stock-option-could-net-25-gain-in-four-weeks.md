Bank stocks are under pressure today, with **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) stock down more than 4% at midday.




JPMorgan stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 32, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 49 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 26, so it could be a good potential candidate for a bearish option trade.


JPMorgan Stock Sits Around 99
-----------------------------


The 50-day moving average for JPMorgan stock is sitting around 99 so that could be a nice area to place a bear call spread.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry.


On JPMorgan stock, an October-expiration bear call spread could be set up using the 100 strike as the short call and the 105 strike as the long call.


I would look to sell that spread for $1 or higher depending on where the market trades today.


Maximum Profit $100 Per Contract
--------------------------------


The maximum profit on the trade would be $100 per contract with a maximum risk of $400.


The spread would achieve the maximum 25% profit if JPMorgan stock closes below 100 on Oct. 16, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless allowing the trader to keep the $100 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if JPMorgan stock closes above 105 on Oct. 16, which would see the premium seller lose $400 on the trade.



While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy, and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


For a trade like this, I would set a stop loss if the spread doubled in value to $200.


JPMorgan earnings are scheduled for Oct. 13, and that could provide a catalyst for the stock to shoot higher. Trading options over earnings can be very risky.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

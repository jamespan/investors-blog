Unlike with a traditional stop-loss to exit a long stock position, owning a put contract in conjunction with the underlying shares guarantees the trader has a concrete stop in place during the life of the contract. On a one-to-one basis, the strategy is called a married put or a synthetic long call and by either name, its steadfast risk profile is undeniable. At the same time though, there are a couple different methods to understanding how the combination works to ensure that protection. 

  

The choice of which math one uses in formulating the dollar risk for the married put position is more of an apple-to-apple varietal situation for the trader, rather than a gift that's going to actually change your bottom line. The most popular method of figuring out the math behind the married put and used by brokers is as follows: (Stock Price + Put Premium) — Strike = Risk Basis. This approach stresses the two debits packaged together in relation to the protective strike price where the trader has the right, but not obligation to sell shares. 

  

  

For instance and to illustrate with **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) and whose shares happen to have broken out today to an all-time high, let's say a trader pays 648.15 for 100 shares while simultaneously buying 1 contract of the September 620 put for $7.30. Imputing those three variables, we have the following: (648.15 + 7.30) — 620 = (655.45) — 620 = $35.45 of risk or $3,545. If the position is held through expiration and shares of AAPL proceed lower, this means the guaranteed maximum loss is about 5% to 6%. 

  

An alternative approach, but not necessarily wrong as the trader reaches the same conclusion of what's at stake is: Stock Price — (Strike — Put Premium) = 648.15 — (620 — 7.30) = 648.15 — (612.70) = $35.45 and the same calculated risk of $3,545. This process separates the stock purchase price from the trader's ultimate stop loss point or the price of where a naked long put buyer would breakeven. Either way you slice it, you come up with a situation that's less prone to going completely bad quickly.

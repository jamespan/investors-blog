**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) has hit resistance and failed to stay above the 21- and [50-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/). Disney stock is also showing weak [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-is-a-simple-yet-effective-stock-indicator/).




Traders who think Disney stock will not reclaim the 50-day line in the next two-and-a-half weeks could look at a bear call spread option trade.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways, and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry.


Trade Offers $95 In Premium On Disney Stock
-------------------------------------------


Monday, a Disney stock bear call spread using the December expiry and the 100-105 strike prices was trading around $0.95 per share.


Traders selling the spread would receive $95 in option premium for a block of 100 shares, which is also the maximum possible gain. The maximum loss would be $405.



The spread will achieve the maximum profit if Disney stock closes below 100 on Dec. 16. In that case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the trader to keep the $95 option premium. 


The maximum loss will occur if Disney closes above 105 on Dec. 16, which would see the premium seller lose $405 on the trade.


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy. You always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


A stop loss could be set if the spread value rises from $0.95 to $1.80.


A Bearish Bet On Disney
-----------------------


Because this is a bearish position, traders who think Disney stock could move higher from here should not enter this trade. The position starts with a delta of -18, meaning it is roughly equivalent to being short 18 shares of Disney stock.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Disney stock is ranked No. 15 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 34, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 45 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 23.

**Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) broke out past a [proper buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in a [new base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/) at 48.23 on Friday and recently was featured as the [IBD Stock of the Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/wfc-stock-breaks-out-jobs-report-lifts-treasury-yields/). Wells Fargo stock has seen its [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-line-gives-crucial-clues-about-stocks-ready-to-make-big-gains/) improve to 92.




The stock is also showing a Composite Rating of 88 and an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 64.


The company earned back its spot on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) as a half-size position as well.


Traders that expect strength in WFC stock to continue could look at a bull put spread option trade.


How To Set Up The Put Spread In Wells Fargo Stock
-------------------------------------------------


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put. Selling the Sept. 17-expiring 47.50 put and buying the 42.50 put would create a bull put spread.


This spread was trading for around $1 on Friday. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $100 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $400. That represents a 25% return on risk between now and Sept. 17 if WFC stock remains above 47.50.


If Wells Fargo stock closes below 42.50 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $400.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 46.50; you can calculate this as 47.50 less the 1.00 option premium per contract.


Delta Reading For This Wells Fargo Option
-----------------------------------------



This bull put spread trade has a delta of 27. This means it is a similar exposure to owning 27 shares of WFC stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves. In terms of a stop loss, if the option premium increased in price from $1 to $2.50, I would consider closing early for a loss.


With earnings set for early October, this trade should have no earnings risk.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

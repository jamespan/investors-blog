This is the first in a series of articles on volatility. Many humorists have noted that "volatility is the most-used word in options — and also the least understood." The goal of this series is to clarify the different meanings of the term *volatility* and to discuss its many possible uses, including describing stock price action, evaluating option prices, choosing option strategies, and forecasting the market. This article discusses the concept of *historical stock price volatility*.

  

**INTRODUCTION**

  

The concept of volatility is *price change without regard to direction*. Since traders tend to think that "up is good and down is bad," the concept of non-directional price change can be difficult to grasp. Despite this challenge of thinking in a new way, option traders should strive to gain an accurate understanding of volatility — and its many uses — because volatility affects option prices, trading decisions and risk analysis.

  

With volatility, it is the percentage change that matters, not the direction. This means that a one percent price rise is equal in volatility terms to a one percent price decline. Also, one price change is not important. Rather, the volatility of a stock's price action is calculated from a series of price changes over several time periods. While the most common time period is one day, volatility can be calculated for any time interval such as one hour, one week or one month.

  

The volatility of a particular stock's price action is derived from a series of daily closing prices. The daily percentage changes are computed, and then the *standard deviation* of those percentage changes is calculated. This standard deviation is referred to as the *historical volatility* of a stock's price over the stated period. For example, "Stock XYZ traded at 30% during the summer of 2012, but it traded at 45% volatility during September and October."

  

**STANDARD DEVIATION EXPLAINED**

  

A *standard deviation* is the average difference between each of the daily percentage changes and the mean percentage change over the time period. If you are not a mathematician, this definition might sound complicated, but the concept is simple. Some stock prices change day to day by relatively large percentages and other stock prices change by relatively small percentages.

  

Volatility is just a number that quantifies the day-to-day price changes in a particular stock. Volatility makes it possible to compare the price fluctuations of the same stock during different time periods, as in the example above. Volatility makes it possible to compare the price fluctuations of two stocks regardless of a difference in price level, and, volatility makes it possible to compare past stock price fluctuations to price fluctuations that are forecast by the options market.

  

**THE MEANING OF "30% VOLATILITY"**

  

The stated volatility percentage, 30% for example, is the annual standard deviation of stock price movement. The concept is similar to a 5-year certificate of deposit that pays "3% interest." It is assumed that the stated 3% is an annual rate. The same is true of stated volatility. Even if the calculation is made from 30 daily closing prices or from 60 days or from any period, it is customary to state the resulting calculation of standard deviation as an annual rate. The consistent use of an annual rate makes comparisons possible. Without knowing the mathematics, it is obvious that a stock trading at 30% volatility is more volatile that a stock trading at 20% volatility.

  

From statistics about normal distributions (bell-shaped curves), approximately 68% of all outcomes occur within one standard deviation of the mean; approximately 95% of all outcomes occur within two standard deviations of the mean; and approximately 99% of outcomes occur within three standard deviations.

  

This means that a $100 stock today that trades at 30% volatility has a 68% chance of closing between $70 and $130 one year from today, which is within the range of up one standard deviation to down one standard deviation. This stock also has a 95% chance of closing between $40 and $160, between up and down two standard deviations. And this stock has a 99% chance of closing between $10 and $190, between up and down three standard deviations.

  

Theses statistical price-range probabilities might not seem useful at first, but they can be the basis for analyzing options prices, for establishing stock price targets, for picking option strategies and for other reasons that will be discussed in future articles.

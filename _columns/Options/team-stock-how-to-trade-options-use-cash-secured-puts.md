Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start out with options — even when it comes to big stock market winners such as Atlassian stock. They are very similar to a covered call and are quite easy to understand once you know the basics.




Anyone selling puts should understand that they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.


For example, selling one put option on a stock with a strike price of $55 would require the investor to buy 100 shares at $55 if called upon to do so. This would require $5,500 in capital. Position size is important here. This example might work fine for someone with a $250,000 account. But it might not be appropriate for someone with a much smaller account.


As always with options, understand the risks as well as the benefits before jumping in. Selling puts can result in significant losses if the stock tanks.


**What Is A Cash-Secured Put?**
-------------------------------


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option. It also involves simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


One stock that caught my eye today was **Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)). The enterprise software stock recently broke out above resistance at the 155-to-160 level. [As noted in Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard), TEAM stock is rising nicely after clearing a 149.80 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) in an [eight-week cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Add that to the fact that the stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 95 and a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99 — [as seen in IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-atlassian-corp-plc-cl-a-team.aspx). This is a strong stock, no doubt about it, and if it can hold above the 155-to-160 level, put sellers will be richly rewarded.


The Options Trade In TEAM Stock
-------------------------------



With the stock trading recently at 169.58, investors could sell an Aug. 21-expiring $155 put for around $11.35.


Investors selling this put would receive $1,135 into their account, which would be theirs to keep. If TEAM falls below 155 by Aug. 21, they would be forced to buy the stock for $155 per share. The effective net cost of the position would be $143.65 per share, thanks to the option premium of $11.35 received.


That's 15% below Tuesday's closing price.


If the stock stays above 155 at expiry, the put expires worthless, leaving the trader with a healthy 7.9% return on capital at risk.


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. That is, if the stock falls precipitously, the trader will suffer a loss; however, the loss will be partially offset by the premium received for selling the put.


The Risk And Consequences Of This Trade In Options
--------------------------------------------------


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if TEAM fell to $0, which would see the trade lose $14,365.


Cash-secured puts are a wonderful way to generate a healthy return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership.


If the put does get assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base and can potentially begin selling covered calls to generate further income from the position.


Remember to always do your own due diligence. Consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

The anxiously awaited unveiling of **Apple'**s ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) third generation iPad has received a less-than-great reception from investors Wednesday. Following the well-televised event and with just under an hour left in the session, shares of IBD 50 constituent and the S&P 500's most heavily-weighted component stock, have fallen a shade-of-red more than 2% in less-than-delicious profit-taking. 

  

On the option side, frenetic activity of 650,000 contracts has swept past its 50-day average of 300,000 but on a rather run-of-the-mill put/call of 0.65. Of particular interest, the Weeklys March 535 call with existing open interest of 6,100 has witnessed volume of nearly 30,000. Maybe more spectacular, the contract has traded in a ultra-wide range from a low of about $1.50 to a high of nearly $9.00 per contract as shares have traded in a slightly bumpier than normal range of about 2.75%. 

  

With the product debut removing some of the uncertainty surrounding whether or not it will live up to its distinguished iPad forefathers, implied volatility has pulled in from 33% during yesterday's session in the regular March at-the-money straddle to just over 30%. 

  

Coupled with theta or time decay, the drop in premium as reflected by the more meaningful expression of dollars and cents has resulted in Tuesday's ATM March 530 straddle priced at $23.50 to trade for a market value of $20.50 Wednesday. The loss of $3.00 per spread even has the benefit of shares having moved a couple points away from the strike. If one were long the long volatility / long curve spread, you'd like to see a good deal more of that kind of move at this point in time. 

  

The more in-the-money either the long call or long put embedded in the straddle goes; the closer the trader gets to having a position built almost entirely on extrinsic premium turn into extrinsic value. And if the extrinsic value grows large enough to the point that it's beyond the initial straddle purchase price, at the end of the day or umm, seven days and counting, there would be a profit. Personally, I don't think I'd hold my breath hoping there's an app for that.

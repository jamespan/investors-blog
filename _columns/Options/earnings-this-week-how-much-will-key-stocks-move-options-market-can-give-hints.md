It's shaping up to be a busy week.


Those who are wondering what sort of stock moves we might see can use the options market to gain an insight into the market expectation.


Expected Moves For This Week's Earnings
---------------------------------------


We can use what is called the expected move. This tells us the market's expected range for an underlying stock for a specific period.


The quickest way to work out the expected move is to look up the option chain and add the price of the at-the-money put option to the at-the-money call option. We use the first expiry date after the earnings date.


While this approach isn't as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate.


Let's take a look at the expected moves for these [companies' earnings this week](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/):


**Monday**


CAR – 18.6%


**Tuesday**

Options Trades For Earnings This Week
-------------------------------------


Options traders can use these expected moves to structure trades. Bearish traders can look at selling bear call spreads outside the expected range.


Bullish traders can sell bull put spreads outside the expected range or look at naked puts for those with a higher risk tolerance.


Neutral traders can look at iron condors. For iron condors, it is best to keep the short strikes outside the expected range.


When trading options over earnings, it is best to stick to risk-defined strategies and keep position size small. If the stock makes a larger-than-expected move and the trade suffers a full loss, it should not have more than a 1%-3% effect on your portfolio.


Good luck this week, traders.

On Wednesday, we discussed IBD 50 constituent and yoga-centric retailer **Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) in front of its earnings report. Some unusual option volume to the tune of 8,700 contracts determined to be a regular June 67.5 / 60 bear-vertical put spread for $1.30 got our attention as a way to position for a potential technical breakdown in shares.

  

It turns out the block print, if our assumption held true, has found this trader quickly profitable as shares got hit following a weak Q2 outlook. With a double in hand earlier in the day and the spread worth more than $2.60, we would have expected to see some type of action in the options pointing to a healthy spread adjustment to reduce the trader's risk exposure. And we would have been wrong too.

  

Surprisingly, with about an hour left in Thursday's session, active but much lesser contract totals suggest otherwise and that this bear is still committed to seeing LULU move lower. With shares down about 8.3%, the spread is worth $3.25 intrinsically and one-half of its potential maximum worth. But in order to realize that amount, shares still need to drop another 4 points and remain below 60 at expiration.

  

While that may or may not be too much to ask for over the next six trading days, the original risk remains. To us, this type situation is ideal for allowing the trader to adjust into a position which won't give it all back.

  

There are numerous ways to do this. Obvious choices include reducing the spread count and / or tightening the vertical to a tighter position. Both types of adjustments can radically reduce risk or even allow for a guaranteed profit regardless of where shares land at expiration. 

  

Another choice amongst the many and compared to the original spread using a 5 x lot to illustrate, is to establish a long put condor. We chose to design this spread with the 57.5, 60, 62.5 and 65 strike puts.

  

This particular condor is more commission intensive as it requires executing two spreads as we've closed out the 67.5 put and bought the 65 to tighten, while selling the 62.5 / 57.5 put spread. In the end you may not agree with this particular spread adjustment, but it should be obvious enough why it still makes sense, even when less cents or dollars might be the final verdict.

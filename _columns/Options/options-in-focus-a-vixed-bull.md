Bulls and other optimists were clipped in Wednesday's session. Not only did the likes of the SP-500 tumble and break many layers of short-term support just after being hoisted back into a "Confirmed Uptrend", but the VIX issued an even more stern warning today. 

  

Last night in this column we wrote bullishly about the implications of the VIX breaking below what we considered a very key 30% level in a "third time the charm" pattern. After two failed attempts over the past month to hold below that level, the expectation was reduced and more normalized levels of volatility could provide the necessary calming muscle bulls would require to take the market into higher ground in a more controlled and constructive manner.

  

"Doink." We were clearly wrong in extending the market our optimism. On the other hand, we were correct in tempering that view by stating our belief that if bulls were going to take authoritative control on an intermediate time frame, sentiment couldn't be allowed to reverse back up above 30% for a third time. While it's unfortunate as to how this undesirable move occurred as the VIX surged higher to about 36%; Wednesday's lesser opening gap of 31%, did allow for a slightly less maddening money decision to be made.

  

Futures are up in the afterhour's market following **Cisco System's** ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) pleasing and well-received report. Nonetheless, in the here and now of what's sure to be another shift for the worse in the Big Picture's outlook our view is the bulls just swung and missed one time too many for our liking.

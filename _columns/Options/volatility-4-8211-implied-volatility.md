This is the fourth in a series of articles on volatility. The goal of this series is to clarify the different meanings of the term *volatility* and to discuss its many possible uses, including describing stock price action, evaluating option prices, choosing option strategies, and forecasting the market. Option traders should strive to gain an accurate understanding of volatility — and its many uses — because volatility affects option prices, trading decisions and risk analysis.

  

Previous articles have discussed historical volatility and probabilities that are derived from the volatility percentage. Historical volatility describes stock price fluctuations over some time period in the past (the bell-shaped curve), and probabilities derived from volatility can be used by traders to estimate the chance that a particular stock-price change will or occur at expiration or prior to expiration.

  

This article discusses implied volatility, which is the volatility "in the market price of an option." Implied volatility is determined by market forces and gives a clue to what "the market is thinking" about potential stock price movements between now and option expiration.

  

**Option Theoretical Values**

  

There are several formulas that calculate the theoretical value of an option, but the Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model was derived first and is best known. The actual option-pricing calculation involves advanced calculus and requires a computer program, but the process is easy to understand. Options-pricing computer programs take six inputs — the assumptions — and calculate theoretical option prices — the outputs.

  

Exhibit 1 shows a traditional textbook approach to the calculation of an option's theoretical value.

  

The six inputs are stock price, strike price, days to expiration, interest rate, dividends and stock price volatility between the current date and option expiration. Of these inputs, the first five can be observed in the marketplace. The stock price, strike price and days to expiration are known with certainty. Although the current interest rate and dividend can change, they are usually constant. Dividends tend to change one time each year, and changes are generally well publicized in advanced.  While interest rates can fluctuate and are not easy to forecast, changes in the interest rate assumption — even substantial changes — have little impact on the resulting option price calculations.

  

Stock price volatility between the current date and option expiration is unknown. While stock price volatility can be calculated with certainty for the past 30 days or 60 days or any historical time period, there is no assurance than the stock price volatility from now to an option's expiration date will match any of these.

  

In Exhibit 1, the volatility input is only an estimate. And remember, "estimate" is just another word for "guess." Consequently, a trader might reasonably ask, "What is the practical value of Exhibit 1, if the volatility input is unknown?"

  

The simple answer is that Exhibit 1, alone, has no usefulness to a trader in evaluating option prices. However, it is essential to know the process of Exhibit 1 — using six inputs to calculate call and put prices as outputs — so that the concept of implied can be comprehended. And knowledge of implied volatility has many practical uses for traders, both stock traders and options traders.

  

**Calculating Implied Volatility**

  

After creating Exhibit 1, using one's best guess about volatility, the next step is to compare the call and put prices generated from Exhibit 1 to the prices in the marketplace. Suppose, for example, that the market prices of the 75 Call and 75 Put are 1.50 and 3.45, respectively. Both prices, therefore, are 20 cents higher than the values calculated from the inputs in Exhibit 1.

  

This, of course, begs the question, which input in Exhibit 1 is "wrong"?

  

We know from the discussion above that the volatility assumption is the only input that cannot be observed with a high degree of certainty. Therefore, we ask, what volatility is "the market" assuming? "The market," of course, is the forces of supply and demand. To answer this question, Exhibit 2 is created.

  

Exhibit 2 takes the five known inputs plus the market prices of the call and put, which are also known, and solves for the level of volatility. Essentially, the options pricing formula is worked in reverse by taking a known output (an option's market price) and solving for an unknown input (volatility). In Exhibit 2, the calculated level of volatility is 27.6%, and this is the implied volatility of the 75 Call trading at 1.50 and the 75 Put trading at 3.45.

  

Exhibit 2 shows that *implied volatility* is the level of volatility that explains the market price of an option. Going back to Exhibit 1, if the volatility input were 27.6%, then the calculated theoretical values of the 75 Call and 75 Put would be 1.50 and 3.45, respectively. Implied volatility makes the theoretical values equal to the market prices.

  

**Usefulness of Implied Volatility**

  

The level of implied volatility today, by itself, is of little value in making option trading decisions. However, the current level of implied volatility can be compared to levels in the recent past. It can also be compared to levels during similar situations in the past, such as immediately before or after earnings announcements. And it is these comparisons that can be helpful in making option trading decisions and selecting option strategies.

  

What if implied volatility rises (or falls) in the next few days or weeks? What impact have past earnings announcements had on implied volatility, and, therefore on options prices? What strategy should I choose if I have a specific forecast for implied volatility? These questions will be addressed in next week's article.

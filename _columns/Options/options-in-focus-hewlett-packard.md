I have a broken monitor, the company responsible has what some might see as broken management, but a fix, at least for the latter, might soon be on its way. We're referring of course to **Hewlett-Packard**  ([HPQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HPQ)). Shares of the beleaguered Dow constituent surged this afternoon while most other stocks did a little bit of technical swooning as buzz of Hewlett's board looking to oust CEO Leo Apotheker left a potentially bullish impression on traders well-versed with the bear. 

  

With shares of HPQ spiking upwards of 10% and up about 8% during the final hour of the session, technicallyÂ it remains within some sort of low level consolidation pattern nestled quaintly below its March 2009 lows. Could Wednesday's price action mark the beginning of a new trend from perhaps a lower-low double bottom best viewed on either the weekly or monthly charts? 

  

For their part, option traders appeared a bit more appreciative of placing bullish bets of various stripes. With premiums bid on the session, long call positioning was a likely force, but verticals, rolling up and out, buy-writes and maybe some three and four-legged spreads using calls all helped push the put/call ratio down to 0.50. 

  

Most active amidst some very heavy activity of nearly 250,000 total contracts; the October surrounding money 25 call and 23 put have seen some rather evenly-traded on volume of 30,000 and 28,500 respectively. In lieu of today's optimism in shares, a bullish risk reversal is a low-priced, but high margin strategy some traders could be using. 

  

With shares at 24.45, buying the October 25 call and selling an equal ratio of the October 23 puts costs about $0.20. Between the two strikes at expiration, the debit is lost. On the upside, the reduced risk and low debit compared to buying an outright call for about $1.14 means quicker profits during the entire life of the position and an expiration breakeven of 25.20. 

  

Below 23 if no action is taken, the trader will be assigned long stock and slightly underwater with a net purchase price of 23.20. That should be a risk factored in when one establishes this sort of position, as the trader has no real control over the assignment process and how and when it might occur. 

  

As this sort of announcement could always come as part of some unwanted development in shares, such as a bearish gap, making the risk reversal more robust by throwing in an insurance policy in the form of a further out-of-the money put makes good sense and cents overall in a market known to be extra mad at times.

**Monster Beverage** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) has paid two top executives a combined $449 million in exchange for about 2.88 million shares purchased as part of a tender offer announced last month.


The Corona, Calif.-based company paid CEO Rodney Sacks and CFO Hilton Schlosberg $156 per share, according to regulatory filings. The two jointly own most of their stakes in the energy-drink maker through a number of limited partnerships.


Monster announced last month that it would spend as much as $2 billion on a modified Dutch auction to buy back shares at prices ranging from $142 to $160. The company purchased about 12.8 million shares in total, or 6.3% of the outstanding equity.


Sacks and Schlosberg, both billionaires, created Monster after buying debt-laden soda maker Hansen Natural in 1992. The two saw some of the biggest windfalls among any U.S. executives last year as theyÂ saw gains of $598 million from exercising options.


Monster Beverage didn't have an immediate comment.

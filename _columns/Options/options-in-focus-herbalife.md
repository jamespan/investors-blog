IBD 50 constituent **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) saw its shares gobbled up on massive volume Wednesday. The price performance is highlighted by a six-plus month breakout to all-time highs from a slightly flawed high level corrective double bottom base and follows the nutritional supplement provider's overall better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings report. 

  

The gain of 6.88% to 66.78 also looks technically promising as the action gapped slightly above the proper buy point of 63.50, held above those levels with a low of 64 and then went on to thrust higher and close near session highs. For stock bulls not already in HLF, Wednesday's finish puts shares 5% above the ideal buy point and at the cusp of being riskier to purchase. However, the use of a bullish vertical might be viewed as one way for would-be bulls to position with a bit more authority. 

  

Sporting fairly decent liquidity of 1,400 contracts daily and still enjoying 2.5 point strikes in surrounding money markets which are quoted $0.05 to $0.15 wide, bulls have a range of options, pardon the pun, to choose from with the vertical strategy. For those seeking more secure but lesser gains, an out-of-the-money bull put vertical or in-the-money call vertical might be considered. 

  

For instance, for a credit of $0.70 or a debit of $1.80, a trader could establish the 62.5 / 65 bull vertical with the former using the puts and the latter the calls. Above 65, $0.70 profit would be the result at expiration for a gain of about 40% in 23 calendar days. As the spread relates to current prices, the positioning allows this limited risk / limited reward bulls some breathing room to the downside. At the end of the day or more correctly, at the end of 23 calendar days, shares could be nearly 3% lower, but above 65, the position would still realize its maximum profit. 

  

As for a couple of the inherent risks, at the ideal buy point of 63.50, the spread would result in a loss of $0.80 and if shares were to pull in less than 2% below that level and below the lower strike of the vertical; the spread would see its maximum loss of $1.80. As a move of this magnitude would also represent a 7% stop loss for a bull confident in purchasing shares at Wednesday's closing levels; traders might further weigh proper position sizing for this type spread versus assumed risk using outright long stock.

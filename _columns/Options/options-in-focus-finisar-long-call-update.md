On Tuesday we discussed the risk on a long, near-the-money September 19 call in Finisar priced for $1.70 in front of its earnings report. It turns out our own appreciation for the shares of FNSR's "low laying fruit" were gobbled up by bulls in Friday's session despite the market's own step back after issuing all-around pleasing results.

  

For our hypothesized bull taking on the previously illustrated near 3.5% risk in our standard model $20K portfolio with shares up about 13% and profits at a near perfect 50% of the $700 exposure, one strategy to reward the trader which can lock in guaranteed profit while maintaining upside exposure would be the use of a modified butterfly.

  

  

The risk graph comparison shows the original long-call position (black and red lines) versus a 4x (4 x -8 x 4) September 21 / 23 / 24 spread which is established after selling out the now deep in-the-money call, but perhaps one always prone to some mad money "all gaps get filled" show of appreciation.

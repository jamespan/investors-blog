Discount variety store operator **Dollar General** ([DG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DG)) is atop constituent stocks of the IBD 50 sporting unusual option activity late in Thursday's session. Truthfully, a day in front of expiration and having had an active June contract due to earnings during its cycle, trading of about 3,500 contracts compared to its 50-day simple moving average of 1,300 is hardly surprising. Either is the fact that a full half of today's volume is in the slightly in-the-money June 50 call. 

  

You may recall two weeks back on May 31 we featured Dollar General as contract volume ballooned in tandem with a potential breakout a couple sessions in front of its earnings report. While we weren't 100% sure the relatively heavy volume in the June 50 call represented opening buyers, given the technical evidence, a potential looming catalyst and a move of just 5% required by shares for the contract to double in price; as we noted that day, the logic made sense enough. 

  

Not to be forgotten regarding an instrument also known at times as a "wasting asset", we went on to mention the risks facing any would-be bulls holding a long call position in the June 50 call, even at the then slightly more attractive and well-traded price of $0.80 to $0.85. Namely, with the contract at that point still fully out of the money, it faced the increasing threat of time decay with just over two weeks left in its life; and not to mention the potential for an early expiration should earnings induce unwanted pressure on shares.

  

As it turns out, shares of DG are up by about 3.5% since our analysis, but despite the relative closeness of tagging the fore-described "percent to double", the call is trading for $0.65 as time premium has all but vanished and the contract trades close to parity even though it's only about 1% in-the-money. Based on today's activity of 1,700 and similar open interest, we'd say some of the prior hypothesized opening buyers were closing sellers with tomorrow being expiration. 

  

It could be worse of course and the reality is for some long call holders, it probably was back on June 5. Not that we can blame them for exiting. That day and following its earnings report, traders collectively took profits to the tune of 3.57% and pushed shares below 50-day simple moving average support on a closing basis. 

  

The problem for those that did exercise their right to "sell to close" that day, the contract traded much lower than the assumed entry price with a mid-market close of $0.13. In the end though and as discussed, with the vast majority of positioning being smaller lot sizes such as 5 contracts, speculating in a secure manner and able to fight another day, was never at risk of being questioned.

Options sellers take note! With CBOE's Volatility Index close to its five-year low, popular option-selling strategies such as covered calls and credit spreads have lower income potential and greater risk potential. Positions have to be monitored more closely, and stop-loss points might have to be tighter than when volatility levels are higher.  
   
Maybe it's time to try buying options!  
   
"Tight stops," means that the point at which a stock position is closed (frequently at a loss) is closer to the current stock price. The risk of being stopped out, therefore, increases.  
   
But with volatility at low levels, the cost of buying call options as a stock substitute is greatly reduced.  
   
This article first discusses the cost of buying in-the-money calls as a stock substitute. Second, some examples using current Leaderboard stocks are reviewed.  
   
An in-the-money call is a call with a strike price that is below the current stock price. With a stock price of 55.00, for example, the 50 call is in the money by five points.  
   
**CALL OPTIONS and THE EFFECTIVE STOCK PRICE**  
   
A call option gives it owner the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price of the call until the expiration date. Stock investors, however, should think ahead to the full cost of the stock if a call is exercised. For example, with XYZ stock trading at $74, consider an XYZ January 70 Call that is trading at $5 per share. For a cost of $500 per share plus commissions, this call, gives its owner the right to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $70 per share at any time until the expiration date in January.  
   
If the call is exercised, then the former call owner becomes a stockholder. The full cost of the stock is the strike price of the call plus the cost of the call plus commissions. In this example, the full cost of the stock — or the effective price — is 70.00 + 5.00 = 75 plus commissions.  
   
The buyer of XYZ stock at 75 who follows the CANSLIM guideline of limiting losses to 8% would likely have a stop-loss at approximately 68.00 for a potential loss of 6.00 per share. But the call cost only 5.00 per share.  
   
In this case, if the stock price drops sharply, the maximum loss of owning the call is less than the loss of 6.00 if the stock were purchased at 74 and sold at 68. Also, it is possible for the stock price to dip to 68 or below, thus triggering the stop-loss, and then rebound higher. Whereas a stockholder could easily be stopped out with such price action, it is possible that the call owner could stay in the trade.  
   
So, the next time you are considering buying a stock, look at the option prices to see if the effective price of buying the stock with an in-the-money call offers you an attractive alternative.  
   
**Leaderboard Examples**  
   
On Tuesday, October 22, **ARM Holdings** ([ARMH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARMH)) was trading at 49.66, 8% of which is about 4. The ARMH January 49 call was offered at 3.60 per share. The buyer of this call has the right to buy ARMH at 49.00 until January expiration in 87 days. The maximum risk, if the call expires worthless at expiration, is 3.60, or 7.2% of 49.66. So the call owner could hold for 87 days and not lose more that the 8% CANSLIM loss-limiting guideline. On the upside, the call buyer is paying an effective price for the stock of 52.60 versus the current price of 49.66.   
   
Also on Tuesday Oceaneering International (OII) was trading at 86.03. The OII January 80 call was offered at 8.10 per share, which translates into an effective purchase price for the stock of 88.10. The option also costs 1.20 more that the CANSLIM guideline of 6.90, or 8%.   
   
A third example is **Ulta Salon Cosmetics & Fragrances** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)), which closed at 126.11 on Tuesday, and the ULTA January 120 call was offered at 12.10. This is 2.00 more that the CANSLIM guideline of 10.10, or 8%.  
   
Should investors buy any of these calls instead of the stock? Is the higher breakeven point worth the lower absolute risk and the near-certain ability to stay in the trade for 87 days? There is no "right" or "wrong" answer to these questions. Every investor must make a personal decision.

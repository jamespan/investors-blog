**United Airlines** ([UAL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UAL)) had an impressive rally Monday, finishing 9.4% higher and decisively breaking through the 50-day moving average. In afternoon trade Tuesday, UAL rallied another 2%.




UAL stock is also above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), and that crucial line has now turned upward.


Traders who think the rally could continue might look at a bullish calendar spread.


A calendar spread trade involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


With UAL stock now trading above 37 lately, a bullish calendar spread might be placed at 45.


Selling the Sept. 18-expiring call option with a 45 strike price will generate around $160 in premium. Meanwhile, buying the Oct. 16 45 call will cost around $295. So, that results in a net cost for the trade of $135 per spread and that is the most the trade can lose.


United Airlines Calendar Spread: How Big A Profit?
--------------------------------------------------



The estimated maximum profit is around $340, but that could vary depending on [changes in implied volatility](https://research.investors.com/options-center/).


The idea with the trade is that if UAL stock trades up to around 45, the October call will gain more than the September call, resulting in a net profit.


The break-even prices for the trade are around 38 and 52.


Calendar spreads are a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.Â I would close this bullish calendar spread if UAL rallied to 45 or if it dropped back below 33.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

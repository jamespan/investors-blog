In 2013, Jim Cramer and I coined the term FANG. Google (now **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL))) was the best of the bunch. From an overall company perspective, this is still true. From a stock perspective, it is not. Alphabet stock is up over 100% since 2013, but its stock performance remains a distant fourth behind **Facebook** ([FB](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FB)) stock, **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) stock and **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) stock.




The company's Q4 earnings report is due Feb. 4 after the close, which always generates some excitement. A positive report will boost the stock price, so the market prices options accordingly.


In the past, the market has priced in a 7.5% move. Implied volatility is rather low for Alphabet right now, so the market is only looking for a 5.6% move versus in the underlying stock. This is a great opportunity for options traders.


The Alphabet chart is subdued but strong. The stock is trapped between the 50ma and 200ma. Volume trends are strong and relative strength has improved. Earnings estimates were revised lower, but the stock price has not changed since October 2018 (when Q3 earnings were released).


Option Play For Alphabet Stock
------------------------------


I suggest using a vertical call spread.



To place a vertical call spread trade, you buy a call and sell a call with the same expiration but at a higher strike price. This strategy limits your risk, because you can't lose more than what you paid for the spread. The maximum gain is the difference between the strike prices minus the cost of the spread.


Let's consider a wide call spread for March 2019 monthly expiration on Alphabet; I chose an 1120/1200 call spread for $2,550 per spread. I will buy the March 1120 call and simultaneously sell the same number of contracts for the March 1200 call. If Alphabet stock moves over 1200 by the March expiration, my maximum gain is $5,450 per spread. (Subtract the cost of the spread from the difference between the strike prices.)


The most you can lose is your original outlay, around $2,550 for one spread. A 2:1 return/risk ratio is pretty decent. Compare that to a straight purchase of the 1120 call strike, which would cost $3,500. By also selling the 1200 strike, you cut your risk by 27% ($950 divided by $3,500). You can always close the spread before expiration to take profits early or to mitigate risk.

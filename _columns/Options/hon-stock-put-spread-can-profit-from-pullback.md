The market remains in a confirmed uptrend but the warnings signs are growing that a pullback may be just around the corner.




Traders with a lot of bullish exposure may want to start hedging their bets by adding some bearish option trades.


**Honeywell** ([HON](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HON)) stock is one that could be a good candidate given the stock is below the 21-day and [50-day moving averages](http://What Is The 50-Day Moving Average, And How It Tells You When To Buy Or Sell Growth Stocks | Investor's Business Daily). HON stock is also testing a key support level at 205 and if that levels breaks, there isn't much support below.



HON stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 43, an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 57 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 53 making it a good potential candidate for a bearish option trade.


An easy trade for beginners is a bear put spread. A bear put spread is a debit spread meaning that we need to pay the premium in order to open the trade.


If we place the bear put spread out-of-the-money we have a trade with low cost and a high reward potential if the stock drops.


A HON Stock Bear Put Spread Can Profit From A Pullback
------------------------------------------------------


On HON stock, a bear put spread could be set up using the 195 strike as the long put and the 190 strike as the short put for Feb. 19 expiration. This trade would cost around $95 per contract with a maximum potential gain of $405.


To achieve the maximum profit, this trade would need HON stock to drop 7.40% between now and expiration on Feb. 19. The break-even point for the bear put spread is 194.05 which is calculated as 195 less the $0.95 option premium per contract.


If HON stock drops early in the trade it may be possible to make a profit at slightly higher prices. At expiration, if HON stock is trading above 195, the entire spread would expire worthless and the trade would lose 100% or $95.


For a trade like this, I probably wouldn't bother with a stop loss. Either the trade works or it doesn't, so I would trade an appropriate position size in case I suffered the full 100% loss.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

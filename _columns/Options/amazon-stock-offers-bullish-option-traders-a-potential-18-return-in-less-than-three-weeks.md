Amazon stock continues to display bullish action and is holding above a rising 21-day moving average.




**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) is No. 13 on IBD Leaderboard with a Composite Rating of 99, an EPS Rating of 93 and an RS Rating of 94. It's green across the board when it comes to Amazon stock.


Option traders wanting to take a bullish exposure on the stock could look at a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined-risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


A Bullish Option Trade For Amazon Stock
---------------------------------------


Traders who think Amazon stock will continue to hold above the 21-day moving average could look to sell a September-expiring 3,125 put and buy a put with a 3,115 strike price.


As of Friday, this spread was trading for around $1.55, which means a trader selling this spread would receive $155 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $845.


That represents an 18.34% return on risk between now and Sept. 18, as long as Amazon stock remains above 3,125.



If Amazon stock closes below 3,115 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $845.


For this trade, if Amazon's stock price dropped below 3,200, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Amazon is due to release Q3 earnings numbers on Oct. 29, so there is no earnings risk with this trade. We've previously looked at bull put spreads on **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), **Lennar** ([LEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LEN)), **Domino's Pizza** ([DPZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DPZ)) and **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)).


This is where an options spread has an advantage over uncovered strategies. With a bull put spread, you always know the worst-case scenario even if Amazon stock tanks.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

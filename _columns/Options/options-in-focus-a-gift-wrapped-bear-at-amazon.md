With under an hour left in Tuesday's mostly lethargic trade, the broader averages have staged a toned down but ho-ho-hopeful rally good for fractional gains. The bid comes on the back of fresh word euro-zone officials are considering an increase in the size of proposed financial firewalls according to the likes of Briefing.com.

  

One name staging a comeback from its session lows but still demonstrating relative weakness with its loss of about 1.80% and technical laggard-ship courtesy of a bearish head and shoulder top and return move into neckline resistance is **Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). 

  

Earlier this morning at Optionetics I wrote a small piece titled [Amazon's Bear's Lair](http://www.optionetics.com/market/articles/2011/12/06/traders-radar-amazons-bear-lair) which covered some of the pattern nuances, as well as discussing January puts or bear verticals as a way to play the technical setup for relatively attractive prices based on our implied and statistical volatility findings. 

  

So far, our analysis is on the right side of the price action. Though it would cost slightly more to involve oneself as a bear using either one of the fore-mentioned limited risk strategies, with a measured move which could see shares of AMZN move to an estimated test of $150 - $155, we think it's still worth a look.

  

  

One contract that fits into our interpretation of the situation is the January 180 put, priced for $6.00 with shares at 192.60. The 30 delta option trades for what we'd determine as fair volatility of 42%, has a couple weeks before theta / time decay is an overt threat and would require a max move of about 13% or to 168 in order to double the contract's premium by expiration. 

  

Shown above, if we're to believe winners take care of themselves and losses require tending, our illustrated two lot priced for a $25K portfolio performs that task if we allow the use of a managed technical stop. We see that decision as necessary somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 over the next couple of weeks; if the trader wishes to keep this bearish position gift-wrapped in a red price ribbon known as the 200-day simple moving average.

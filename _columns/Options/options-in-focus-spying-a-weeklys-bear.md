With about half an hour left in Thursday's session, I can't help but repeat a question posed earlier today at Optionetics. In my daily lunchtime piece I playfully asked, "What do 11000, 1150, 2500 and some 7% to 9% add up to?" The simple answer and simple math was thought to be profit-taking into key resistance for the major averages, though bulls were and remain stubborn in their newly whetted appetite ways. 

  

As the now stretched looking price action comes in front of Friday's jobs data, which we suspect will find traders backtracking from a bearish / profit-taking gap, options provide the only truly limited risk way to position while maintaining such directional opinions.

  

And with many market products now offering Weeklys with short-term life cycles, traders have additional flexibility in designing positions more strategically aligned with those faster money outlooks, which we might harbor from time to time.

  

  

To illustrate one such possibility, readers are looking at the risk graph of a 3 lot bear put vertical in the **S&P 500 ETF**  ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) using the October Weeklys 2 115 / 112 put combination. With shares near 116, the slightly out-of-the money put spread trades for $0.93 and has six trading days until expiration. 

  

That demise could feel early should today's, yesterday's and Tuesday's mad but glad, fast money bulls continue to steer themselves higher. However, I personally like the chances for a pullback and maybe something more grizzlyâ€”and I love a market that allows one to secure their bottom-line, for better or worse, even more.

Lucid Motors stock is currently showing a lot of volatility and is up 33% in the last five trading days. Implied volatility in **Lucid** ([LCID](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LCID)) is sitting at 109%, which is slightly less than the high of 132% set in late October, but much higher than the twelve-month low of 66%.




High volatility means elevated option premiums. Traders with a bullish bias could look at a cash-secured put strategy.


How To Set Up This Option Trade In Lucid Motors Stock
-----------------------------------------------------


A cash-secured put is a slightly less bullish trade than buying the stock. It is considered a neutral to slightly bullish trade.


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to get assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.


Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start with options. They are like a covered call and are pretty easy to understand once you know the basics.


Traders selling puts should understand that they may be assigned 100 shares for purchase at the strike price.


Let's look at an example using [Lucid Motors stock](https://www.investors.com/research/lucid-motors-stock-buy-now/).


A Lower Cost To 'Buy' Lucid Shares
----------------------------------



With the stock trading at 35.13 on Tuesday, investors could sell a December put with a strike price of 30 for around $2.55.


Investors selling this put would receive $255 into their account, which would be theirs to keep. If LCID falls below 30 by Dec. 17, they would be required to buy 100 shares at 30. The effective net cost of the position would be 27.45, thanks to the option premium received.


That is 21.9% below Tuesday's closing price.


If the stock stays above 30 at expiry, the put expires worthless, leaving the trader with a 9.29% return on capital at risk. That works out to be 77% annualized.


Risk Vs. Reward
---------------


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls quickly, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the premium received will help to offset the loss.


The maximum loss on the trade would occur if LCID fell to $0, which would see the trade lose $2,745, but most traders would [cut losses long before then](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/still-the-no-1-rule-for-stock-investors-always-cut-your-losses-short/).


With Lucid Motors set to report quarterly results on Nov. 15, the stock could be in for a wild ride around that time.


Cash-secured puts are a great way to generate a return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership.


If the put does get assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base and can potentially begin selling covered calls to generate additional income from the position.


The downside for this relatively new IPO is its less-than-stellar ratings. After all, Lucid Group is a new startup and has yet to officially post any quarterly sales, let alone profits. The company has a Composite Rating of 59, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 3, and a Relative Strength Rating of 97.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

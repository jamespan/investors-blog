With roughly 90 minutes left in Tuesday's session, bulls in all their infinite wisdom, have pulled up their bootstraps and reclaimed Monday's technically disparaging price action. For longer-term investors today's closing gains could prove supportive of a slightly late follow-through day signal on Day 11 of the count if market prices and volume improve just a bit more from current levels. 

  

One leading name already displaying signs of what bulls would like to see more of are shares of **Hansen Natural** ([HANS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HANS)). The NASDAQ 100 and IBD 50 constituent is up about 6.5% with shares at 85 intraday. Technically, today's bid has broken above a handle buy point on heavy and above-average volume within an "odd" cup-shaped base or what some might label a "V" shaped pattern. 

  

Options in Hansen Natural maintain decent open interest indicative of bulls, bears and hedgehogs playing at times. However, slightly wide spreads across the front couple expiration months which average $0.20 to $0.25 between the bid and ask of an individual contract does limit the variety of spreads traders can realistically choose from. Without giving away too much to enter into a option spread, as well as not having to worry too much about exiting; two-legged verticals, straddles or strangles and calendars are about as complex as traders might consider. 

  

Checking the board and this appears to jibe with Tuesday's contract activity. Most active by a fairly wide margin is the at-the-money September 85 call on volume of about 550 versus open interest of 4,300. We'd surmise today's traders are mostly placing naked long bullish bets with the contract or establishing buy-writes or synthetic straddles; both of which use a combination of contracts against stock. 

  

Priced at $4.30 per contract, for the former hypothesized long call buyer; a double would require shares to continue up an additional 10% by expiration. Prior to that day some 24-calendar days out, gains could come slightly quicker. However, time decay and implied volatility are formidable enough opponents at present as to prevent that type of paper profit from materializing much sooner than the fore-described endgame requirement. Personally, we're not passing judgment one way or the other on this one. We're just passing on some food or umm, beverage for thought for bulls.

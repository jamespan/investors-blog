Just when it may have seemed this party was getting started, Germany had to foil a few bulls' plans at extending last week's "best since" gains in the likes of the S&P 500. The fact is though, while Germany's fighting words of no credit package forthcoming later this month during the European Union meeting acted as the easy headline trigger for Monday's slippery bout of profit-taking, the VIX was already signaling the need for a bit of technical backing and filling on Friday. 

  

Short-term, last week's near 6% gainer in the S&P 500 brought with it vastly improved sentiment in the VIX as the market's notorious fear gauge broke below the key 30% level for the first time in more than two months. However, that same confidence was a bit too aggressive during Friday's rally of 1.74% in the broader average. 

  

A differential reading in excess of 15% for the VIX relative to its 10-day simple moving average ultimately produced a situation where one should more often than not, expect a reversion or move back towards the instruments mean value as represented by the near-term moving average. But should this be construed as a "mean" move or an opportunity for bulls? 

  

Intraday Monday and just under 90 minutes to go, the VIX is up 15% at 32.50%. As the index is back above the historically overly fearful 30% level, the bid is likely sending jitters down the spines of some bulls with mutterings of "It's not over!" insinuated. Yet and optimistically, premiums are now only 4% to 5% below the 10-day simple moving average, which also happens to be sloping down and crossing below the 30 and 50-day simple moving averages. 

  

With the VIX's jump higher coinciding with a test of 1200 in the S&P 500 and the broader market having signaled a follow-through day to confirm a rather promising looking October bottom, Monday's pullback looks like a much more reasonable spot to enter into some long deltas in a stock or index of one's choice versus riskier overconfident momentum like Friday's which has been "mean in reverting, but not exactly nasty."

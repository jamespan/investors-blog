Last night we discussed a weekly double calendar play in **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) ahead of earnings. With a substantial skew between the weekly January and weekly February contract contract, a realistic assessment of a volatility crush was needed, before one mistakenly grew too infatuated with a misleading risk graph. 

  

By making a guesstimate regarding the pending drop in implieds we were able to graphically depict a very different P&L landscape which showed less favorable breakevens, the position's max profit potential cut roughly in half and a loss where one didn't exist prior if shares remained unchanged in price in post-earnings trade. 

  

The point, more than to sway opinion one way or the other, was to help readers better understand the risks involved with a calendar type position, before reaching a decision, one way or the other. 

  

With less than an hour in Friday's session, shares are cooperating very nicely for our illustrated 3-lot double calendar. With AMZN near our 170 put strike, even with a volatility crush which admittedly ran a bit deeper than our estimate, the spread is up $350 and taken in about 70% of its max profit potential as shown in the risk graph below.

  

  

Looking above and some might be thinking, what do you mean the position has taken in 70% of its max profit potential? The placement of our other calendar on the 195 call clearly shows an approximate doubling of the profit at the 170 put strike or does it? 

  

This risk graph, much like last night's original unadjusted IV double calendar, is misleading due to implied volatility unlikely to exist in the real world. Because the February call is well out of the money and essentially worthless (but trading for a couple pennies), a skew of about 11 points exists over the at-the-money 170 put with real dollars of extrinsic value at stake. 

  

Right now, the model shows 32% IV for the at-the-money 170 put and 43% IV for the call. If shares were to rally and the call was still priced at 43%, it would trade for more roughly $1.65 more than the current $3 price of the put on 32% IV. When we do the math on three contracts we find the max profit shown at 195 is more of the "funny money" stuff than the kind we can take to the bank at the end of the day. *What do you think?

With just more than an hour left in the session, No. 1 ranked IBD 50 component and yoga-centric apparel and accessory outfit **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is continuing to shape up quite nicely with today's high-powered breakout from a pattern base just shy of seven weeks in length. 

  

Shares of LULU up roughly 5% at 77.10, the proper buy point of 74.70 is about 3% south of the current action. At the same time, a "just shy" mid pivot of 73.83, within "a near" double-bottom shaped base whose breakout has come literally one day early, is a bit less than 5% below. With that said, what's an option trader to do? 

  

Well, checking the board and one very popular area of concentrated activity has been the out-of-the money February 80 call. Almost 5,500 have traded thus far compared to open interest of just 1,425. The activity strongly suggests a good deal of "opening" positioning on the part of traders, however, that's not to say those traders are initiating from scratch. 

  

Just yesterday and on an initial weaker volume breakout attempt at the fore-mentioned mid pivot, more than 2,000 of the then out-of-the money February 75 calls traded at a closing price of $1.35. With those options now slightly in-the-money and trading for $3.80 for a gain of more than 180%; its more than a bit likely some serious rolling, hedging or adjustments to those same calls, have been involved in today's steamy hot activity. 

  

  

Two possible position adjustments are illustrated above. Assuming a purchase of 4 February 75 calls for $1.35 on Thursday, "Strategy 1" involves selling half of the original contracts held for $3.80 and letting the balance ride for the time being. Strategy 2 involves selling 4 February 80 calls for the current going price of $1.35 per contract. This turns the long call position into a free or no cost bull call spread. 

  

Which option, pardon the pun, is better? That's really up to traders and one's own technical assessment regarding the future combination of speed and movement of shares. In the end though, both are less sweaty ways for existing bulls still looking for a nice stretch to come but respecting those type moves can involve a little pain as well.

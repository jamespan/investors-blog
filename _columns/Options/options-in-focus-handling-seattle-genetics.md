With an hour left in Wednesday's session, one decent size bull is looking to handle, pardon the pun, biotech **Seattle Genetics** ([SGEN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SGEN)) breakout with the purchase of out-of-the money calls. Earlier in the session with shares scoring an above-average breakout of its handle buy point of 20.67 as part of a corrective cup-shaped base, a trader appears to have purchased nearly 2,000 October 22.5 calls for $0.50.

  

The near $100,000 wager will require a move of about 13% by Expiration Friday, which is twelve trading days out in order to double in price to $1 per contract. Doing the simple math, breaking even would take a 6% to 7% move in shares over the same period. Is that a good bet? Well, the positioning does mean time decay is a factor.

  

Further, in a product not known for its ultra tight and deep liquidity provision, the trader needs to accept the reality of slippage and slightly larger losses if he or she plans on using a discretionary stop should the stock falter or opinions change.

  

That said, given the market's sometimes-inhospitable volatility of late and if trader hasn't committed more than 2% of their portfolio to such a speculative purchase, it is what it is. And to us, that means having absolute authority and defined risk control over the position, which in a sometimes and often mad money market, makes added sense if not cents.

Eight trading days ago, what I'm sure feels like an altogether different market for many investors, we discussed whether an at-the-money June straddle in IBD's then No. 1 ranked stock **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) would be a good moneymaker as part of pre-earnings volatility rush. I still don't have the answer to whether the position would be historically suitable based on backtesting past earnings events and evaluating how premiums fared as growing implieds battled time decay. 

  

Personally speaking that remains a mystery as I'm not positioned and didn't do the required homework. What we can say about this particular straddle is that out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, restless bulls have helped the straddle generate strong returns with three trading days remaining until the actual earnings release. 

  

Since our column on May 25, the June 95 straddle has gone from $9.60 per spread to $14.50 for a return, for all intents and purposes, of 50% of the position's initial risk. Implieds which had been trading near 49% have jumped into the mid 60s. However, it's the delta which has given this special breed of volatility bull their real profits as the increase in implieds, while decent-looking on the surface; have actually been countered by slightly higher time decay over the same period. 

  

At the same time though, the straddle has managed to benefit from seven sessions of lower overall prices amounting to about 14%. The price action has resulted in our delta neutral, at-the-money straddle going fairly well in-the-money by a bit more than 11 points and the position managing to build its negative delta, currently near -80 per spread, and enjoy the run much more than otherwise in those sometimes doggishly, listless days of summer.

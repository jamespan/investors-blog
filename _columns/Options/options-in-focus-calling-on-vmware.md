In what can only be called an ignominious start as well as a warning flag to the broader market's follow-through day signal established on Tuesday, virtualization software outfit **VMware** ([VMW](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VMW)) attempted to buck the trend by breaking out late in the first hour of trade from a high handle base. 

  

Option traders appear to have embraced the early technical move with calls favored over puts by a 4-to-1 margin on 20,000 total contracts. With prices somewhat well-bid statistically and in relation to recent implied trading range values, we can make a fairly confident but basic assumption of bullish call buyers on a whole entering the name in sympathy with the breakout attempt. 

  

Most active on the board and by a wide margin, the front month June 100 and 105 calls have seen volume of about 3,000 and 5,200 contracts change hands respectively. Compared to open interest of 3,200 and a much smaller 1,000; no doubt opening transactions have played a good part in that action. 

  

At the same time, with shares reversing hard back below the proper buy point and wide trading ranges of nearly 1.5 points and 3 points and prices near range lows, there's no doubt money management has also been an unfortunate, but necessary trade in order to keep losses small and manageable.

  

For buyers of those calls, there is always the option to hold the contract and wait. As a bull that's purchased a call, one is ensured of limited risk in the end. But with just 12 trading sessions left until expiration, "time" isn't on those traders side as the pressure of theta or time decay, plays an increasingly tough factor to overcome. 

  

With a buy point of $99.29 and shares now nearing $96, even a repair strategy which can turn the likes of the June 100 call into a June 95 / 100 bull call spread and reduce the trader's own buy or breakeven point, would be feeling some of wrath of today's very mad money market.

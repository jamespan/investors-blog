Are some of your recent stock purchases under water? If so, what should you do? Sell? Hold? Double-up? While there is never a scientific answer, the options market offers an alternative to doubling-up that many investors find appealing.  
   
The place to start is with your forecast. If you believe that your initial decision to buy was wrong and the future holds only bearish price action for a stock, then the logical choice is to sell.  
   
On the other hand if you still believe in a stock's bullish prospects, then buying additional shares, or doubling-up, may be appropriate. Doubling up lowers the break-even price on the total position, but it has two disadvantages. First, it requires the commitment of additional capital. Second, it doubles the risk, because you have more shares.  
   
A third possibility is the stock repair strategy using options. If your goal has changed from a desire to make a quick profit to just getting your money back, and if you are forecasting a partial recovery in the stock's price, then the stock repair can get you to the break-even point on such a price rise without requiring additional capital and without increasing risk.  
   
**Darla's Frustrating Experience**  
   
Assume that Darla purchased 100 shares of XYZ stock at $60 not including commissions. Unfortunately, Darla's high expectations for XYZ did not materialize, and the shares are now trading at $50. Although unhappy, Darla believes that the decline is over and that XYZ will rise to $55. She also has changed her goal. She now just wants to break-even without having to commit additional capital and without having to assume additional risk. She wants her original amount capital back so it can be invested somewhere else.  
   
**Darla's Stock Repair**  
   
Here is what Darla might do to implement the stock repair strategy. Don't forget that this transaction must be established in a margin account.  
   
Continue holding 100 shares of XYZ (cost $60, currently $50)  
Buy 1 90-day 50-strike Call at 3  
Sell 2 90-day 55-strike Calls at 1.50 each  
   
Notice that the net cost of the option position is only transaction costs, because the total premium received from the two sold 55 calls (2 x $100 x 1.50 = $300) offsets the premium paid for the one purchased 50 call (1 x $100 x 3.00 = $300).   
   
Also notice that both of the short 55 calls are "covered." One is "covered" by the owned 100 shares of XYZ stock, and the other is "covered" by the purchased 50 call.  
   
Table 1 shows the profit or loss of the owned stock, the one purchased 50 Call and the two sold 55 Calls at various stock prices. The table shows that Darla can get to breakeven on a stock price rise to $55 at option expiration. Graph 1 is a profit/loss diagram of Darla's stock plus options strategy.  
   
**Review of Possible Outcomes**  
   
There are three possible outcomes at expiration. The stock price can be below $50, between $50 and $55, or above $55.  
   
First consider the downside. If XYZ is at or below $50, then all options expire worthless. Since the net cost of the option strategy is zero, not including commissions, the strategy neither helped nor hurt. Darla still has the risk of XYZ declining in price, but she does not have any more risk, as she would have if she purchased additional shares.  
   
If the stock price is between $50 and $55 at expiration, then the short 55 Calls expire worthless. The long 50 Call, however, will be in-the-money, and its value will lower Darla's losses. Darla could either sell the 50 Call or exercise it. If she exercises it, she would then purchase an additional 100 shares of XYZ stock and assume all the risk that such a position entails.   
   
The third possible outcome is that XYZ stock closes above $55 at expiration. In this case, Darla's long 50 Call will be exercised and her two short $55 Calls will be assigned. The result would that Darla has closed out her total position and breakeven and then have all her capital back.  
   
The possibility of an early assignment must not be overlooked. But this would not be a problem, because both of Darla's short 55 Calls are "covered," one by 100 shares of owned stock and one by the long 50 Call.  
   
**Better than Doubling Up?**  
   
The stock repair strategy is not better than doubling-up, it is just different. If the price of XYZ stock is above $55 at expiration, then Darla achieves the goal of breaking even without having increased downside risk. But breaking even is the best she can hope for. In contrast, the strategy of doubling-up offers the possibility of participating in gains from a stock price rise above $55, but it also doubles the risk.  
   
**SUMMARY**  
   
One strategy is not better than another in an absolute sense. Different strategies only offer different advantages and disadvantages. The stock repair strategy has the advantage of lowering the break-even price of a losing stock position without increasing risk or requiring an additional investment. The disadvantage is that the upside potential is limited to the strike price of the short calls. Doubling-up, in contrast, has the advantage of lowering the break-even point without limiting upside profit potential. Doubling-up, however, has the disadvantages of increasing risk and requiring the commitment of more capital.  
   
While not better in an absolute sense, the stock repair strategy is an interesting alternative to doubling-up. Maybe you should consider it the next time you find yourself with a losing stock position and you hear yourself saying, "If only I can get out of this mess, I swear I'll never do it again."

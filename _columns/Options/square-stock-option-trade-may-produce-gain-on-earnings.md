**Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) reports earnings after the close on Thursday. With that in mind, let's take a look at a butterfly option trade held over Q3 earnings results, due on Thursday after the market close.




A butterfly is a neutral option trade that offers limited risk and limited profit potential.


Butterfly spreads involve three different option strike prices, all within the same expiration date, and can be created using either calls or puts.


How A Butterfly Spread In Square Stock Works
--------------------------------------------


A typical butterfly in Square stock would be constructed as follows:


* Buy 1 in-the-money call
* Sell 2 at-the-money calls
* Buy 1 out-of-the-money call


Let's take a look at how that might look on Square stock:


* Buy 1 Nov. 6 weekly 150 call @ 23.00
* Sell 2 Nov. 6 weekly 160 calls @ 12.00
* Buy 1 Nov. 6 weekly 170 call @ 6.20


The total cost of this trade is $520 and that is the maximum loss potential on the trade.


The maximum gain is $480, which is calculated by taking the difference in strike prices less the premium paid ($10 x 100 less $520).


The break-even prices are 154.80 and 165.20 (160 plus and minus 5.20).


A Ceiling On The Upside
-----------------------


A butterfly options trade holds a tent-like shape with the potential for very large profits around the short strike. However, keep in mind that it's unlikely you would ever achieve the maximum profit.



The ideal scenario would be for the large-cap stock to finish around 160 on Friday. If Square trades above 160, traders will need to watch for early assignment on the 160 calls.


Square Stock Ratings
--------------------


Square holds a 95 [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/). Analysts polled by FactSet see earnings diving 36% to 16 cents a share on a 239% leap in sales to $2.04 billion. Big drops in earnings the prior two quarters have hurt Square's [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/), which is now a 69, of a best-possible 99.


A 1.2 [up/down volume ratio](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-a-strong-updown-volume-ratio-is-key-to-success-for-stocks-even-ipos/) (see it either at [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/) or in the left-side data panel on a [MarketSmith weekly chart](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF)) implies net institutional buying in Square stock over the past 50 trading sessions.


Butterfly spreads can be a bit confusing for beginners, so it's best to paper trade this way and see how it performs. Trading butterflies over earnings like this is also quite risky because of the potential for the stock to make a big move.


However, butterflies have an advantage over a short straddle because they are risk defined and you always know the worst-case scenario.


Remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

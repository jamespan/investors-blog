Iron condors are neutral trades that are best used when volatility is high. We certainly have high volatility currently, so let's look at an example using the **Nasdaq QQQ Trust ETF** ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)).




As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay with the expectation that the stock won't move too much in either direction.


First we take the bull put spread. Using the April 16 expiry, we could sell the 265 put and buy the 260 put. That spread can be sold for around $0.60.


The bear call spread could be placed by selling the 330 call and buying the 335 call. This spread can be sold for around $0.80.


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1.40 in premium.



The profit zone is with QQQ between 263.60 and 331.40. This is calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received. As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 — 1.40 x 100 = $360.


Therefore, if we take the premium ($140) divided by the maximum risk ($360), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 38.88%.


QQQ Iron Condor Is An Advanced Strategy
---------------------------------------


That's a very nice return and it would be great if things were as easy as that. However, iron condors generally need some management as the trade progresses and the stock starts to move in either direction.


That takes a bit of skill and experience, so this isn't a strategy for beginners, but they are a fantastic strategy once you get the hang of them.


For a trade like this, I would set my adjustment points around 280 and 320.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**AppLovin** ([APP](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APP)) joined [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) last week after passing a 91.91 buy point in a [cup base](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/dow-jones-sets-record-high/). Investors who think APP stock will continue to rally and don't want to risk significant capital can use long call options rather than buying the stock outright. This can be a good way to protect precious capital in these volatile markets.




How The Long Call Option Works
------------------------------


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (strike price) up until a certain date (expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage (this can be both a good and a bad thing).


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of APP stock, they would have to put around $9,000 into the trade.


Instead, the investor could gain a similar exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option.


One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.


Setting Up The APP Stock Trade
------------------------------


Say an investor buys one APP stock call option contract with an 82.5-strike call option expiring on January 17. Since that's trading around 15 today, the option only costs around $1,500 rather than $9,000.


The break-even price for this call option is equal to the strike price plus the premium paid, which would make the break-even price 97.5.


The most the trade can lose is the premium paid of $1,500, which would occur if APP finished below 82.5 on January 17.


However, if APP stock shoots higher, the upside is unlimited.


Other Ways To Play The Trade
----------------------------


Using options in this way can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock without risking as much capital as would be required to buy the stock outright.


Savvy traders can further reduce the risk by selling an out-of-the-money call, turning the trade into a bull call spread.


For example, selling the Jan. 17, 110-strike call would reduce the trade cost by around $450 but would also limit the upside above 110.


A stop loss could be set if APP drops 8% from the entry point.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-apple-aapl.htm), APP stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 82 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 97.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

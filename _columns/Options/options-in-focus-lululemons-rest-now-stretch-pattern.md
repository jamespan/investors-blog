If I might be so bold, it appears No. 1 ranked **Lululemon** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) is shaping up within a symmetrical triangle pattern of five weeks. IBD's own research doesn't support this type consolidation base but others do see the directionally neutral congestion area as one to watch for either breakouts or breakdowns.

  

A slight bias generally goes to the existing trend. But to fall back on IBD's wariness regarding late stage base counts, which LULU looks to be; well, the effects of gravity after a nice fashionable "Best Six" run, as well as much larger gains over the past year and since the market's March 2009 bottom, can't be dismissed. 

  

For option traders, spotty liquidity provision means positioning is mostly limited to the front month and maybe the next month out. Right now, outrights or simple spreads might be considered feasible in June and / or July, without having to get too sweaty that you're reaching too far for a healthy fill on your order. 

  

Implieds in the high 40s are expensive statistically relative to LULU's underlying movements, but are mostly within the trading range of the past couple months. They're also likely to get more expensive as earnings are but a stone's throw away on the morning of June 9. 

  

  

Given the June contract with its "best of" liquidity provision will still be on the board come that announcement, we can expect, and which the chart above illustrates, that an implied volatility rush will emerge in the coming days. This seems all the more a given with the narrowing technical base setting shares up for a potentially explosive move that I'm sure more than a few other traders also recognize. 

  

"Caveat Emptor Please?" Before you step out and put on a pre-earnings, directionally neutral volatility spread such as the long straddle or strangle, know your risk tolerance and how to manage it sensibly. Also make sure to do that other required homework. 

  

Namely, through backtesting prior earnings events you'll have to figure out for yourself whether an on-the-surface spike in implied volatility actually makes sense and "cents" to the bottom-line. In the end, with the June contract under increasing pressure from that big fat Greek heavyweight known as theta, the long straddle or strangle may not be a marriage made in heaven for that type of long premium bull.

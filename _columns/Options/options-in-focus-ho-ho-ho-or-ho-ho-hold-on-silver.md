The **iShares Silver Trust ETF** ([SLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLV)) along with its partner in crime, the **SPDR Gold Trust**  ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)), have been anything but merry of late. Some and likely more than a few Grinch or grizzly types out there might go so far as to say "Downtrend! Inverse cup-with-handle!!!" We get the picture. But we also happen to appreciate corrections and subsequent patterns viewed as a more seasonally jolly, "Double bottom!"

  

What's a bull or bear to do? Our thoughts are those sometimes hard-to-handle delta wagers might be better passed on in favor of a more delta neutral long strangle. The long strangle buys an out-of-the money call and put, typically equidistant from the share price in the same contract month. In buying extrinsic premium, as neither contract holds real intrinsic value at this point, the trader is seeking a large move in shares and / or an increase in implied volatility to realize a profit with "swifter and quicker" price action always more beneficial. 

  

As implieds are in the bottom quartile of their yearly trading range and statistically fair relative to the underlying shorter and longer-term price swings in SLV, buying a strangle is more enticing as the trader can enter cheaper than otherwise. As important, is the expectation of a catalyst for shares to move aggressively. If there's no catalyst, cheap can remain cheap and in turn, become quite costly for the long strangle holder as the premium bought can disintegrate to $0.00 by expiration. Here though and acting as the catalyst (we think) is the described coin flip style chart situation.

  

January premium for a long strangle is tempting to consider as near-term contracts always cost less than outer months. However, with the next couple weeks seeing trading opportunities cut potentially short due to the holiday calendar, as well that contract already inside the sensitive "under 30 days" theta threshold and prone to extra decay; we'd say February as a starting point looks more the gift to long strangle plays.

So, what's next? Was Wednesday's decent price action the proverbial "All Aboard!" command spoken by the market? If it is, one spot that's making all the right moves is **Acme Packet**  ([APKT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APKT)). 

  

IBD 50's current No. 5 ranked stock is currently carving out a two-plus long, inverse head & shoulder continuation pattern. Others may also call the price orchestration a mostly flat, 20% wide base-on-base pattern. Either way, shares do appear on their way to breaking out based on today's constructive price and volume as it nears recent pivot pattern highs of 77.25 and 77.64. 

  

Checking the board, premiums aren't cheap but not over the top given earnings are coming up next Tuesday. May front month implieds are in the high 50s to low 60s. Prices are mostly within the existing trading range of implied values for the last couple months and match longer-term statistical volatility. Implieds are slightly elevated compared to shorter-term volatility readings of the past couple months, which are currently at fresh range lows in the 20s and 30s. 

  

Given the varied information embedded in prices and liquidity which is far from great and all but dries up beyond the front month; traders wishing to use APKT's option market do have to be more aggressive or acceptant of extra risk than otherwise. A bull call spread in May could likely get filled mid market without much difficult, given a bit of intraday weakness (help) from shares and if left out as an open order. 

  

  

For a bit less dollar risk, using two of the three same strikes, a trader could also attempt a butterfly but would likely have to give up a bit of theoretical edge to receive a fill. If trader considers going that route but wishes to position for a successful breakout without having the possibility of shares overshooting the short upper strike and what would amount to being a small loss (the debit), a modified "closed wing" fly might be considered. 

  

The "closed wing" fly, a self-coined variation on the regular long butterfly is simply a fly whose bull vertical component is wider than its bear vertical component. The maximum profit one can stand to make is still at the sweet spot of the sold contracts. But given its construction; while you would give some profits back on a dramatic move in the intended direction; it's a design Wile E. Coyote might wish he'd have in coming up with in making a better bull trap.

A shift Wednesday night to a confirmed uptrend for the market means it's "all systems a go!" right? Personally, I'm not too agreeable with what I'd label a sketchy call. Nonetheless, appreciative of October's tendency to find major market bottoms, a nicely weekly hold of uptrend and 38% support from the March 2009 bottom in the S&P 500 and premiums having come down a good idea. I am agreeable to nibbling on married put positions as a way to test the market waters as a bull. 

  

The married put or synthetic long call is simply the purchase of long stock combined with a long protective put that's typically placed near or out-of-the money in relation to the stock. When option premiums come in or fall, the cost for that protection is cheaper. Ultimately though, we still want volatility in the underlying, but the kind which maps out a path for shares into higher ground. 

  

As the married put is two-thirds of a collar, a successful leg into a short call can put this limited risk bull into a very advantageous position after accepting a bit more initial risk as he or she does forfeit the financing of the put purchase with the call. That all said, if a trader comes across a stock that's not already stretched and due for an immediate pullback in their technical estimation, this could be a nice longer-term strategy to consider in names which also provide solid liquidity provision in the listed call and put markets. 

  

  

Shown above and to illustrate and educate but not "wreck or rec", is **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)) and a 3x married put using the November 25 put. The footwear and apparel outfit is one current name we keep on our personal watchlist that maintains suitable option markets and good underlying volatility. If readers do a bit more digging, they'll see CROX is slightly flawed, as it isn't quite there technically or fundamentally. Nonetheless, with a married put strategy and then perhaps a collar to try on a bit later, CROX may be good to wear, pardon the pun, in order to get a more secure foothold. We currently maintain no positions in Crocs.

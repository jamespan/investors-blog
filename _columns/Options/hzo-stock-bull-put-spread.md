**Marinemax** ([HZO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HZO)) stock is currently the No. 2 stock on the IBD Leaderboard and is holding up well during this bout of market [volatility](https://www.investors.com/research/options/qqq-etf-iron-condor-options-trade/). The stock is highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 99 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Marinemax stock is currently above rising 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages.


If you're looking for a bullish trade idea, HZO stock ticks a lot of boxes.




One option trade worth looking at is a bull put spread. A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


**Bullish HZO Stock Option Trade**
----------------------------------


Traders who think Marinemax stock will not drop below 42, could look to sell an April 16 40 put and buy an April 16 35 put.


On Friday, this spread was trading for around $1.00. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $100 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $400. That represents an 25% return on risk between now and April 16 as long as HZO stock remains above 40.


If Marinemax stock closes below 35 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $400. The break-even point for the bull put spread is 39 which is calculated as 40 less the 1.00 option premium per contract.


If Marinemax's stock price drops below 42, I would close the trade early for a loss.


Earnings for HZO stock should not occur before April 16, so this trade would not have earnings risk.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

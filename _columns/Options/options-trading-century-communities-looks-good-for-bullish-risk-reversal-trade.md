**Century Communities** ([CCS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CCS)) was recently [added to the IBD Sector Leaders  screen](https://www.investors.com/research/century-communities-stock-meets-ibd-most-stringent-criteria/), one of IBD's most stringent screens. In the options trading market, a bullish risk reversal trade for the homebuilder looks good.




CCS stock is a top-rated growth stock in IBD's database, with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 95, an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 85.


The company builds single-family detached and attached homes in metropolitan markets in Colorado, Texas, Georgia and Nevada.


In the options trading market, bullish traders wanting some upside exposure can do so via an option trade called a risk reversal.


Risk reversals are bullish trades that involve selling an out-of-the-money put. Use the proceeds to purchase an out-of-the-money call.


Options Trading: Risk Reversal Trade
------------------------------------


Let's take a look at how a risk reversal trade might look on CCS stock.


Going out to March 2022 expiration gives the trade plenty of time to work out. The March 65 strike put can be sold for around $7.60 per contract.



Those proceeds can then be used to purchase a March 75 strike call option, which was trading around $8.20 per contract yesterday.


As the sold put is slightly lower-priced than the bought call, the trader pays a debit of $0.60 per contract or $60 in total.


Don't make the mistake of thinking this is the most the trade can lose. The 65 put has a total loss potential of $6,500, which would occur if CCS stock went to zero.


The trade will initially perform similarly to a long stock position and will profit as the stock rises and suffer losses if the stock falls.


Delta: 85
---------


The risk reversal has a delta of 85. That means the combined position is roughly equivalent to owning 85 shares of CCS stock.

At expiration, if CCS stock is between 65 and 75, both options expire worthless, and the trader loses the $60 premium paid.


Larger profits at expiration will occur above a price of 75, and the higher the stock goes, the better for this trade. There is no limit to the profit potential.


Losses will occur at expiration below a price of 65.

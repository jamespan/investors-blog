Investors left to their own devices, pardon the pun, in IBD 50 constituent and the world's largest company, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), have opted to follow along in sympathy with the broader S&P 500 Friday with a matching decline of about 1.8% as we head through the lunchtime hour.   

  

On the menu for option traders, ultra-heavy fast money opening and closing activity has been the order of the day in the Weeklys June contract, which expires in a couple hours. Concentrated positioning and shutting down of existing risk show up as a well-traded, "slightly" out-of-the money 570 / 575 call spread with similar volume of 28,000 to 30,000 contracts on the two strikes and compared to much lesser open interest of 5,800 and 8,250.   

  

On the put side, equally frenetic trading of about 24,000 contracts versus open interest of 8,900 in the near-the-money 565 put has transpired. With shares about 0.50% above the strike at 567.75, the $1.55 contract would require another 1% of downside from shares this afternoon in order to double in price.  

  

Looking further out, while Apple options have traded a fairly healthy 290,000 on the day, nothing sticks out as striking, well other than the sheer number of strikes that traders have to choose from. The June contract for instance maintains a massive 270 strikes from a low of 255 to a high of 960.   

  

Beyond theory, that type of trading provision allows a dizzying amount of real world opportunities in the form of outright purchases or sales, verticals, risk reversals, straddles, strangles, butterflies, condors and ratio spreads. Go out a contract month or go closer in to the Weekly June's that expire next Friday and the possibilities, coupled with second-to-none liquidity for a stock of this caliber are nearly limitless.   

  

Looking a bit more pragmatically at the board and a potential resistance play on the daily chart as shares falter below the 50-day simple moving average following a counter-trend rally; we like the idea of an out-of-the-money bear call spread using either June or July as a way to position with limited risk and not being required to be correct on price direction either. Where's the specific recommendation you ask? That's not our job per se. Further, our thoughts are that you can give a trader an apple and feed him for a day or let them learn to grow their own fruit and feed them for a lifetime.

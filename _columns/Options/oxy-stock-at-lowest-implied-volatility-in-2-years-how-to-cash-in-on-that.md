**Occidental Petroleum** ([OXY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=OXY)) is showing the lowest level of implied volatility in two years. That could mean it's a good time to be a buyer of volatility in OXY stock.




We can do this via a strategy called a long strangle, which is constructed through buying an out-of-the-money call and an out-of-the-money put.


Buying a long strangle is cheaper than a [long straddle](https://www.investors.com/research/options/walmart-stock-not-likely-to-stay-quiet-this-straddle-profits-from-rise-in-volatility/), but will still suffer from time decay. That means the options will lose a little bit of value with each day that passes if the stock doesn't make a big move.


With a long strangle, the further out in time the trade is placed, the slower the time decay. But the options are more expensive and require more capital.


For OXY stock, a long strangle could be placed by buying a 72.50 strike call and a 52.50 strike put for the March 17 expiration. The call was trading Wednesday around $1.30 and the put around $1.60.


Cost Of Trade $290
------------------


When we add the two together, the total cost of the trade would be around $2.90 per contract, or $290. This is the total amount of risk in the trade, and the maximum that could be lost.


The break-even prices are calculated by taking the strike prices plus and minus the cost of the strangle.



That gives us break-even prices of 49.60 and 75.40, but profits can be made with a smaller move if the move comes earlier in the trade.


For example, the estimated break-even prices at the end of January are around 60 and 69. 


Changes to implied volatility will have a big impact on this trade and the interim break-even prices. So it's important to have a solid understanding of volatility before placing a trade like this.


The ideal scenario is a large move in either direction within the first week or two of the trade.


Steady OXY Stock Price Would Hurt Trade
---------------------------------------


The worst-case scenario with this Occidental Petroleum long strangle would be a stable stock price, which would see the call and put slowly lose value each day. For a long strangle, I usually set a stop loss at around 20% of capital at risk, which would be around $60, and a profit target of around 40%.


Occidental Petroleum is due to report earnings Feb. 28, and implied volatility is likely to drop after that event.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), OXY stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 81 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 87. 


A [bull call spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/with-four-stock-acting-bullish-call-options-offer-exposure-at-lower-cost/) on **Shift4 Payments** ([FOUR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FOUR)) discussed Dec. 17 has achieved a profit of around $350 and can be closed. A [ratio spread trade](https://www.investors.com/research/options/boeing-stock-today-put-ratio-spread-may-produce-1100-profit/) on **Boeing** ([BA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BA)) explained Jan. 4 can also be closed for a nice profit.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Veeva Systems** ([VEEV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VEEV)) stock popped up on my radar today as it is showing an implied volatility percentile reading of 83%.




This means the current level of implied volatility is higher than 83% of the readings we've seen in the last 12 months. High volatility means it can be a good time for short volatility trades such as butterfly spreads.


Butterfly spreads profit when the stock stays within a defined range, ideally with an associated drop in implied volatility.


A typical butterfly would be constructed as follows:


Buy 1 in-the-money call


Sell 2 at-the-money calls


Buy 1 out-of-the-money call


Let's take a look at how that might look on VEEV stock.


Buy 1 April 16 260 call @ 38.00


Sell 2 April 16 290 calls @ 19.25


Buy 1 April 16 320 call @ 8.55


The total cost of the trade is $805 and that is the maximum loss potential.


The maximum gain is $2,195 which is calculated by taking the difference in strike prices less the premium paid ($3,000 less $805).


The break-even prices are 268.05 and 311.95 (290 plus and minus 21.95).



The Butterfly Spread in VEEV Stock
----------------------------------


A butterfly trade has a tent-like shape with the potential for very large profits around the short strike. It's important to keep in mind that it's unlikely you would ever achieve the maximum profit.


A good aim for a butterfly trade is to make a 20% return on capital at risk. In this case that would be around $160.


Butterfly spreads can be a bit confusing for beginners, so it's best to paper trade this way and see how it performs.


VEEV stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a [Relative Strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) Rating of 70, a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 91 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 98. Earnings are set for March 2, so this trade would have earnings risk.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Elon Musk has made quite a show of running **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) of late. The volatility in the stock has been good news for options traders. For options trading beginners, nothing is scarier than volatility. For an options trader that gets comfortable with simple concepts, the world of options trading opens up. The two most important components for an options trader to consider are direction and volatility.




The first thing to analyze is the direction of the stock. In the case of Tesla, a few factors can give an options trader a bearish outlook. With a recent Composite Rating of 7 from IBD, Tesla is not considered a market leader. The EPS percentage change from last quarter is -130%, and its industry group recently ranked a dismal 187 out of 197 groups ranked by IBD based on six-month price performance.


The final piece to the puzzle of direction is the technical analysis of the underlying stock. TSLA on a weekly chart has spent a few weeks below the 10 week and 40 week moving averages. Often if a stock's price is breaking key support areas, it will continue to fall.


Weak fundamentals and broken support in the technicals are both strong bearish warning signs. The strategy most options traders would be comfortable with in this situation is to buy a put â€” which gives the buyer the option to sell a stock at a fixed price, hoping it will fall in price and the buyer can gain the difference. Buying a put is typically the simplest strategy for options traders that are just beginning, but buying into high volatility can make this strategy more dangerous than a lot of traders may realize.


Options Trading Volatility
--------------------------


It's also important to consider the news cycle. In just the span from Sept. 4 when the stock slid on a Goldman sell rating to Sept. 7 when Elon Musk was livestreaming his activities while smoking a marijuana laced cigarette on a podcast, news flow has been terrible around the stock. This erratic behavior, combined with a near mass exodus of some senior executives, has fueled plenty of bearish sentiment.


The Implied volatility (IV) is the value assigned to an option based on the expected movement of the stock in the next year. The higher the IV number, the more expected movement of the stock. A higher IV number will also mean a higher options premium, which is good for options sellers but bad for options buyers. The attached chart shows the IV for Tesla over the course of the past year.

Its IV was recently at the highest point in the past year. This volatility level makes buying a put option the wrong choice. The fear for an investor is buying a put option during high volatility only to see the stock fall along with volatility coming out of the option. If enough volatility comes out of the option, there may not be enough movement (delta effect) to counteract the loss in volatility.


What Is The Solution?
---------------------


In a high volatility scenario with a bearish direction, the best solution may be to sell a call. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a stock at a set price within a set period of time. The buyer benefits if the security's price rises. Selling a call will bring a credit into the pocket of the investor, and if the security's price falls and volatility falls the investor can then buy back the option at a reduced amount.


This trade style has its negatives, and represents a potential for unlimited loss if the price rises drastically without the investor taking action. Another scenario that could be effective for an investor is to use a spread trade, buying a put option but selling another put option to finance the trade. This combination of buying and selling a put can negate the effect of volatility. To be an effective options trader it is important to remember the two key points of volatility and direction.

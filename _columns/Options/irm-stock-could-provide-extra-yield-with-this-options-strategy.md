**Iron Mountain** ([IRM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=IRM)) is showing some decent ratings and setting up a cup-with-handle pattern on its chart. A cash-secured put on IRM stock can bring a little income to your account or get you into the stock at a discount.




IRM is the global leader for storage and information management solutions. The company helps customers reduce costs and mitigate the risks associated with protection and storage of their information assets. Back in 2014, IRM got approval to convert its business to a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) structure back in 2014. Sure, it provides services like shredding. But storage rental revenue accounts for over 63% of total revenue, according to the company's third-quarter earnings report.


The company is showing a three-year EPS growth rate of 10% (technically funds from operations, since it's a REIT). IRM stock pays a dividend of 5.2%.


IRM stock shows a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 82, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 74 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 87. Those numbers aren't bad, but they're also not of the caliber that we usually look for in market leaders. That might make you just slightly bullish on IRM stock, as opposed to having huge expectations.


Cash-Secured Put Option Trade
-----------------------------


With an outlook of just slightly bullish on IRM stock, a cash-secured put may be preferred over owning the stock outright.


A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock. If the stock goes up, sideways or down slightly by the Jan. 21 expiration date, the put expires worthless and you keep the premium. A nice little income play.


If the stock goes down below the strike by expiration, expect to be assigned shares of IRM stock. But you would be picking the shares up at a discount and actually reducing your risk vs. buying the stock at the current price.


Selling put options is an easy place for investors to start with options. They are like a covered call and are pretty easy to understand once you know the basics.


But this bears repeating: Traders selling puts should understand that they may be assigned 100 shares of IRM stock at the strike price.


Trade Setup For IRM Stock
-------------------------


With IRM stock trading at 47.68 yesterday, investors could sell a January put with a strike price of 45 for around $1.15.


The option trade brings in $115 into your account, and you set aside $4,500 so that you're prepared to buy 100 shares of IRM at the strike price.


Should that happen, the effective net cost of the position would be 43.85, thanks to the option premium received. That is 8% below yesterday's closing price.


If the stock stays above 45 at expiry, the put expires worthless. That's still not too bad. It leaves the trader with a 2.6% return on capital at risk in just a couple months' time.


That works out to be 14.7% annualized.


Trade Risks For Cash-Secured Put Strategy
-----------------------------------------


The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership. If the stock falls quickly, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the premium received will help offset the loss.


The maximum loss on the trade occurs if the stock price of Iron Mountain falls to zero. The trade loses $4,385, but most traders would cut losses long before then. Also, that 8% discount means you lose less.


There is also the opportunity cost. If IRM stock is wildly successful, your return is limited to the premium received no matter how much the stock goes up. That may prove to be paltry by comparison.


With IRM set to report earnings in early February, this trade should have no earnings risk.


Cash-secured puts are a great way to generate a return on strong stocks, potentially without ever having to take ownership.


If the put does get assigned on IRM stock, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost basis and can potentially sell covered calls to generate additional income from the position.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

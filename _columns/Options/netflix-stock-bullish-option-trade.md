**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) has long been one of the strongest stocks in the market and a member of the popular [FANG stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/) acronym. Big-cap technology is certainly leading the way during the latest recovery and a bullish option trade in Netflix stock could be a way to profit.




During the [coronavirus bear market](https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/), Netflix stock dropped more than 26% from a 52-week high of 393.52 on March 3 to 290.25. However, the tech giant recovered and rallied over 39% since that low on March 12. It's currently a member of [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


Netflix stock was punished on Tuesday, along with the market, dropping over 4% on the day. On Wednesday, it showed an upside reversal after testing support at a crucial level around 393. That coincides with the high going back to late February and early March. Shares were up again Thursday at midday.


Quite often with the strongest stocks, prior levels of resistance become support. They can provide a foundation for the next leg of the rally.


Netflix stock is also holding above its rising 50- and 200-day moving averages. This is generally considered a positive sign. [On the downside, it's also showing a bearish MACD cross.](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=nflx)


Netflix Stock Bullish Option Trade

That means it's a great time to be a seller of options on Netflix stock. That coupled with the potential bullish action makes it a great candidate for a [bull put spread](https://www.investors.com/research/options/bull-put-spreads-2/).


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration. To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


With Netflix stock bouncing strongly, it makes sense to place the bull put spread below the strong support at 393. Selling a June 19th 370 put and buying a 360 put would generate $225 in premium based on Tuesday's closing prices.


Bullish Option Trade Risks And Rewards
--------------------------------------


This trade offers a 29% return potential in one-and-a-half months. The maximum profit on the trade would be $225 per contract. If Netflix closes above 370 at the June 19 expiration, the entire spread would expire worthless and allow the premium seller to keep the entire option premium minus commissions.


The maximum risk is $775. If Netflix stock closed below 360 at expiration, the premium seller would lose the difference of the strike prices minus the premium received.


The breakeven point for the bull put spread is 367.75. That's calculated by taking the strike of the short put at 370 less the $2.25 option premium per contract.


Set a Stop Loss If Netflix Stock Hits These Levels
--------------------------------------------------



Looking at the chart there is clear support at 393. A break below this level changes the chances of success. Traders would need to rethink the trade and potentially close it out. There is also further support around 375 at the rising 50-day moving average if traders wanted to give the trade more room. Sticking to these stop-loss levels will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.


If you're new to options, it's important to understand this trade could lose 100% if Netflix stock takes a big tumble. It's important to understand the risks as well as the potential profits. Make sure to check with your financial advisor before making any investment decision.

In front of tomorrow morning's earnings release, market heavyweight and heavy construction equipment outfit **Caterpillar** ([CAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT)) is seeing traders in its options largely at sleep or umm, dozing off. With shares off about -0.90% with less than two hours left in Thursday's session, trading in CAT options has, thus far, been very quiet with a total of 18,500 calls and puts changing hands compared to its daily contract average of 45,000. 

  

Puts are outpacing calls by a slight 1.25-to-1.00 margin and not offering up much in the way of alarm bells or cattle calls. Most active in the calls, traders have skipped past the April Weeklys, with contracts expiring tomorrow as well as next Friday, in favor of the regular May cycle and the surrounding money May 110 and 115 call. 

  

Similar volume of 2,300 and 2,800 in those two strikes could be the result of trader interest in verticals, traders rolling bets either up or down or of course or of course (without looking at prints) outrights as well. With larger open interest in both contracts, it's up for grabs as to what the other guy or gal is actually doing. 

  

With implieds near 30% in May, those traders that are actually trading options can expect premiums in May to come down towards the low to mid 20s. That's not exactly a headline worthy volatility crush but it's still a slight factor of importance for traders pricing in risk as either buyers or sellers of naked premium. 

  

On the put side, the Both the May 110 put and April Weekly 110 put set to expire tomorrow, are seeing similar activity of roughly 2,000 contracts. Again, the representation of equal volume and larger existing open interest could mean outright buyers or sellers both closing and opening, traders rolling or spreads being put up, though in this instance we'd be looking at a calendar and not a vertical. 

  

While we don't know which of these positions the most popular trade is today, we can make one decent guesstimate. If long stock is also involved (held), either an outright purchase for protecting those shares or a calendar roll, wherein April is closed and the May put purchased; would be viable choices. 

  

On the other hand, if we're looking at calendars being opened as the favored activity today, those traders are less likely to hold long stock which they're looking to protect. A long calendar could certainly enhance returns if shares finish narrowly away from current levels. In that situation, premium taken in from the short contract on a combination of a hard volatility and theta crunch would be greater than the amount lost to the somewhat mild volatility crush in May. 

  

Potential gains of this kind however are far removed from maintaining definitive protection. They're good to a point, until they're not as the spread will expand into the strike but then begin to narrow and close down completely the further shares are away from the 100 level. So, while there might be a little bit of upside profiteering with a bit of downside in shares; were CAT to get razed by a bulldozer, the limitations of that strategy would be quickly realized as having less than adequate protective qualities.

"Yeesh!" Last Thursday night we optimistically discussed an admitted, slightly flawed technical and fundamental situation in footwear and apparel outfit **Crocs** ([CROX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CROX)). The timing couldn't have proven much worse. Monday after the close, the company warned on its outlook, which in turn cast a ghostly pallor upon any positioned bulls. 

  

For collar traders and our slightly more bullish married put strategist, the good news is the protective put has acted as a very real PFD or Personal Flotation Device for the trading account. While a naked long bull would feel as though the crocs got to his or her position with stops bloodied by today's 38% gutting of shares. These two position types maintain limited risk designed by the trader, regardless of how devastating a move might be and as CROX certainly draws attention too.

  

  

The other bit of good news is by keeping the account afloat and away from devastating, the married put and / or collar trader can, if they so decide, act as value or treasure hunters of sorts and accumulate shares without increasing the net debit of the position. Above, readers are looking at how a collar adjustment involving an additional 100 shares purchased at 16.40 on the original 3 x married November 25 put position would look. The new position maintains a grand total of 400 shares combined with 4 November 15 puts and short 4 November 19 calls to finance roughly 70% of the put. 

  

Risk will inevitably increase as the trader is sitting on a loss from the original bullish position. In this case, we've gone from about $1,000 risk to roughly $1,700. However, by swapping out the now well-in-the-money November 25 put and using those proceeds to finance this little treasure trove operation (maybe), the net debit incurred is only $7,700 compared to the original cash basis of $8,500.

  

This type of limited risk and what some would call, dynamic maneuver isn't for everyone of course. Ultimately, more dollars are at stake and the trader should still have grounds for seeing the share price moving higher. That said, if after serious deliberation you're still looking to profit as a longer-term bull, your swim to the surface or umm, breaking even, after a nasty roll with a croc, is that much closer than otherwise.

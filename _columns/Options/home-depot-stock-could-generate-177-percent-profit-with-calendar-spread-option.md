**Home Depot** ([HD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD)) recently rallied back above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/) as well as the [50-day simple moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/). That's bullish. So, Home Depot stock could be setting up for another run at its all-time high of 345.69.




For a megacap play, HD has a reasonable profile with an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 80, an EPS Rating of 94, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 49. The RS Rating is low, but it has shown improvement in the last two weeks.


Traders thinking Home Depot stock might head higher in the next month could look at a bullish calendar spread. This trade involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Traders with a price target of, say, 340 could place the bullish calendar spread at that price.

Home Depot Stock: Setting Up The Calendar Spread
------------------------------------------------



Selling the Aug. 6-expiring call option with a 340 strike price will generate around $135 in premium. Plus, buying the Aug. 20 340 call will cost around $290. That results in a net cost for the trade of $155 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is around $430, but that can vary depending on changes in implied volatility. The idea with the trade? If HD stock trades up to around 340, the calendar spread will increase, resulting in a net profit.


You can view a bullish calendar spread as a good way to gain some upside exposure on a stock without risking too much if the move doesn't work out.


The ideal scenario? A rise up to 340 around August 6 with little change in implied volatility.



Home Depot is due to report earnings on Aug. 17, so I would close this trade before then if I did not want exposure to the upcoming news.


**Micron Technology** ([MU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MU)) is another stock that may be considered for this bullish option strategy. The 52-week high for MU stock is 96.96. The stock is currently trading around 80.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

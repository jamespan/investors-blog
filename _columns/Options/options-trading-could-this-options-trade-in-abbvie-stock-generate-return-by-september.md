A calendar spread in options trading is an income trade. It involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.




Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias in which case they would use puts.


In today's example, we'll look at a bearish calendar spread on **AbbVie** ([ABBV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ABBV)). With AbbVie stock trading around 93, setting up a calendar spread at 90 gives the trade a slight bearish hue.


Selling the Sept. 18-expiring call option with a 90 [strike price](https://research.investors.com/options-center/) will generate around $75 in premium. Buying the Oct. 16 90 call will cost around $225. That results in a net cost for the trade of $150 per spread. That is the most the trade can lose.


The estimated maximum profit is $140, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade? If ABBV stock trades down around 90 in the next few weeks, the calendar spread will increase in value. This allow you to close the trade for a profit.

Options Trading: Know Your Exits
--------------------------------


The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 86.50 and 94.



For a trade like this I would set a profit target of 30% and a stop loss of 20%. For position size, I would risk no more than 2% to 3% of my capital.


Bearish traders might also consider something simpler like a bear call spread, similar [to this trade in Tesla stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/tesla-stock-analyzing-cnbc-tesla-option-trade-idea/).


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

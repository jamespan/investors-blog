As Hong Kong property prices slump with real estate stocks, investors are looking to the options market for protection.


Traders paid the most in four years in January to hedge against losses on Sun Hung Kai Properties vs. the cost of bullish bets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A similar pattern emerged in options on Wharf Holdings.


A measure of the city’s property stocks is down 33% in the past year, with losses accelerating in January as the Hong Kong dollar weakened and real-estate sales fell to the lowest in at least 25 years.


Hong Kong’s home prices have dropped about 9.5% from their record high in September, according to an index compiled by realty company Centaline Property Agency. Investors are pulling money out of the city amid concern that it will be squeezed between China’s economic slowdown and rising interest rates in the U.S., which drive up borrowing costs in Hong Kong through the currency peg.


Bocom International sees property values sinking as much as 30% this year, while **UBS** ([UBS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=UBS)) says that may happen by the end of 2017.


Short-term interest rates in Hong Kong have jumped since the end of last year, threatening to hurt housing affordability. Housing costs have more than doubled from the end of 2008, prompting the government to impose measures to curb prices that had become out of reach for many local residents.


Implied volatility for three-month contracts -- with an exercise price 10% below Sun Hung Kai shares -- was 6.9 points more than on similar bullish contracts on Jan. 20, the biggest premium since October 2011.


“Investors want to buy some put options in order to hedge the downside risk as they are expecting property stock prices to fall," said Sam Chi Yung, a strategist at Delta Asia Securities, noting that the purchases are more likely for hedging than for speculation.


To maintain its peg with the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong must match interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The weakening yuan is also adding to the pressure by eroding the purchasing power of mainland homebuyers, according to some analysts.


Amid the gloom, rock-bottom valuations on most property shares has spurred some brokerages to recommend buying the stocks. Hong Kong’s biggest developers and landlords trade at average 8.2 times reported earnings, compared with 16 times globally.


For Pauline Dan, the head of Greater China equities at Pictet Asset Management, the worst for homeowners might be still to come. While shares have priced in negative news, “the physical market definitely would have more downside because the adjustment is just beginning," she said.

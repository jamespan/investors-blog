There was a commercial a couple years back that referred to putting some lipstick on a pig. It was funny stuff to say the least. In the market they say bull and bears make money but not pigs. While funny on some levels, it's also very good advice. Combine the two and what do you get? Well if you're like me and have been thumbing through charts, IBD 50's No. 3 ranked cosmetics and fragrances outfit **Ulta Salon** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) comes to mind with its stubbornly tenacious uptrend.

  

The one thing about persistent and very trendy price behavior is it generally means a failure of traders to collectively do the right thing while it's still easy technically speaking, to do so. With regards to an uptrend like ULTA's, which has seen multiple weekly base counts, nary a "reset" in a couple years and well past any of those prior bases the option to protect those gains sounds like smart advice, as well doing the right thing, without giving advice of course. 

  

Checking the board and the reality of doing the right thing at the right time is more difficult to come by. Poor liquidity characteristics and what appears to be a hard-to-borrow situation as evidenced by ULTA's more dearly priced puts are two unwanted characteristics which prohibit common spreads, as well as strategies which might include or eventually rely upon needing to short shares. That said, other than paying up in the moment but maybe much less so based on prior trend riding abilities, is about as clever as it gets. Well, other than taking profits the old fashioned way and hopefully in front of a still very agreeable crowd.

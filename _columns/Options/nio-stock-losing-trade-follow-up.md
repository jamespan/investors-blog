Not all option trades go according to plan. Back in January we looked at a [long-term cash secured put](https://www.investors.com/research/options/nio-stock-short-puts-can-generate-attractive-returns/) on **Nio** ([NIO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NIO)) stock.




At the time, NIO stock was trading around 55, but yesterday the stock dropped to 41.53.


In January we looked at selling the Jan. 21, 2022, put with a strike price of 55 which was trading for around 17.55.


With NIO stock dropping nearly 25% I thought it would be good to check in and see how that cash secured put is doing. On Wednesday, that January put was trading around 21.90 for a loss of around $435.



The capital at risk on the trade was $3,745 which can be calculated by taking the strike price (55) minus the premium received (17.55) multiplied by 100. Therefore, the trade is down around 11.60% which is much less than the drop in the stock, but still quite painful.


How to Handle Losing Trades
---------------------------


The question is what to do now?


There are three choices: No. 1: Cut the loss and wait for the next opportunity. No. 2 Stick with the original plan and wait until January, taking ownership of the stock if need be with a cost basis of $3,745. No. 3. Hedge some of the exposure with some negative delta trades.


No. 3 is a little advanced and not something we've talked much about so far.


No. 2 is tempting, but risky. There is some chart support for NIO stock at 40, but if that breaks, who knows how far it could fall.


The safe trade is to close out the short put by buying it back and waiting for the next opportunity. Who knows, maybe we'll be able to buy the shares for 25 in the near future?


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

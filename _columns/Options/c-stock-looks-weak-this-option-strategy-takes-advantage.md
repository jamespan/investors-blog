Many banks look like they are finding resistance at moving average lines with **Citigroup** ([C](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=C)) among them. Here's a bearish option strategy on C stock that can help reduce your risk by offsetting market exposure.




Weakness In C Stock Prompts Bearish Stance
------------------------------------------


C stock popped onto my radar as it broke back below its 21-day moving average.


That's typically a bearish development and it led me to check the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/). C stock is ranked No. 14 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 38, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 69 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 24. The weak ratings are what I'm looking for when scouting for bearish option trades.


Today, let's look at setting up a bearish diagonal put spread.


For Citigroup stock, I looked at a May 20, 57.50 put to buy for around $4. I'd sell an April 14, 52.50 put for around $0.60.


The total cost of the trade is the net premium paid, estimated to be around $3.40 per share or $340 for a standard contract of 100 shares.


The net delta on the trade is -89 so the exposure is roughly equivalent to being short 89 shares of C stock. It's important to note, this will change as the stock moves and the trade progresses.


The strategy earns the most profit if C stock closes right at 52.50 at April expiry. Estimated profits would be around $230 per contract at that price.



If C stock drops even further, the trade will still make around $200.


Managing The Trade
------------------


Citigroup is due to report earnings on April 14 before the market open. I would aim to close the trade before then.


What if I'm still bearish on C stock at the April 14 expiration? Well, I still have another month on the long put and can hold it. Or to bring in some more premium, I could sell another monthly put against it to bring down my cost basis even more.


In terms of risk management, a stop loss of 20% makes sense. If the trade is down roughly $100, I would close it out.


Adding some bearish trades to your option portfolio can help offset the risk of [other bullish trades](https://www.investors.com/research/options/marriott-stock-bullish-option-trade-idea-could-profit-by-mid-april/) and neutralize your overall market exposure.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

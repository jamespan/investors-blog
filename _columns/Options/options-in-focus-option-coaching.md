When it comes to buying options for a directional edge, there are a couple simple do's and don'ts to consider. And one also has to scrutinize one's outlook on the stock, before placing the order. To illustrate, IBD 50 constituent **Coach** ([COH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=COH)) was atop the unusual volume board Thursday as more than 34,000 contracts traded and ten times its daily average. 

  

With shares up 4.6% near the end of the session, COH was sitting just below its triggered buy point of 76.80 from a three-weeks-tight pattern. As the heaviest option action focused on the out-of-the money March and April 80 calls with volume of 2,700 and 4,500 compared to open interest of 527 and 4,585 respectively, the shopping of long call positions certainly looked to be the purchase of choice. 

  

But which call is better? Well, with the March contract set to expire next Friday, a long call holder enjoys a purchase price of just $0.25 risk per contract and requires just 5% from shares of COH in order to make today's breakout a 100% return on investment. That sounds fairly nice, doesn't it? 

  

The other side of the coin to this seemingly nice proposition is with six trading days remaining, despite today's technical trigger, the odds of a profit and its potential size are reduced to reflect that same pricing. In fact, the probability of profit or "PoP" entering tomorrow stands at 44% with a lowly gain of less than $0.10. This combo works its way down to just under 20% at expiration, though an estimated $0.20 profit is 80% of the original wager. 

  

On the other hand, the April call while costing a good deal more in dollar terms at $1.45 per contract, does provide bulls with stronger odds of a favorable outcome. Notwithstanding how good today's breakout attempt looks to chartists as we near the end of the session, 14 calendar days from now and just inside the "30 day" increased theta threshold, this call maintains a beefier 44% probability of profit and an expected profit of $0.38. At the same time, come expiration the "PoP" is at 31% while the forecast to fatten one's Coach labeled wallet stands at $0.86, which you might be able to purchase a bit more easily, with a payoff like that.

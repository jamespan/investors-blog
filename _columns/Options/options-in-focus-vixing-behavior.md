Mortals like me are still waiting on the headline cause for Wednesday's final 30 minutes and turn for the worse in the market. Maybe Brian Williams on NBC will fill me in later tonight. That said, price and sentiment was "VIX'ing" to say the least. Investors went from scooping up bargains from a technically quantified oversold and fearful market condition to giving back the bulk of intraday gains of about 1.25% in the S&P 500 and finishing with a rather meek increase of 0.28%. 

  

"How, now brown cow?" With the VIX finishing just above 20% and matching Tuesday's fearful highs, the stretch in the market's most notorious sentiment gauge stands at an uneasy or rattled 17.50% relative to its 10-day simple moving average. As we discussed yesterday and in days past, during such relative bouts of panic or occasions of too much confidence like last Thursday, the price action typically spells opportunity for the contrarian investor. 

  

Opportunity of course doesn't mean there's a guarantee. But, I can say with rather strong authority that these less-than-common signals have consistently yielded profits to both short and even longer-term traders. Personally, I see no reason to believe that trend won't continue. Unlike some market or chart patterns that seem to fall out of favor or altogether go into realm of obscurity, the VIX is and always will be a mean-reverting instrument. 

  

This means prices soaring to infinity on bearish sentiment or the VIX crumbling to zero on oodles and oodles of confidence are never going to happen. At times it may feel like a new precedent is going to be set, but in the end, commonsense or that closely-watched but less discussed 10-day simple moving average typically prevails over bulls and bears taking things too far in one direction. And just in case this is one of those occasions where Mr. Market decides to get a bit nastier, the option of using limited risk spreads like the directional vertical always makes good sense and often enough, better cents to consider.

Options, perhaps, have more myths about them than any subject related to investing and trading. These myths persist despite the industry's existence in the U.S. for 40 years. This is the second in a series of articles that address several myths about options. Last week Myth #1 "[Options are Only for Speculators](http://news.investors.com/investing-options/061213-659834-myths-about-options-and8211-take-1.htm)" and Myth #2 "[90% of Options Expire Worthless](http://news.investors.com/investing-options/061213-659834-myths-about-options-and8211-take-1.htm)" were debunked. Today, the record is set straight on four more myths.

  

**Myth #3: Options are only for short-term traders.**

  

There are many important components in a long-term investing program. Even if you purchase a stock with the intention of holding it "forever," there will inevitably be short-term periods of time when insurance is desired. For income-oriented investors, continuous (or nearly continuous) covered writing with 30-, 60- or 90-day calls can produce returns that compare favorably to bonds. Even though a specific option has a short-term expiration, the repeated use of such options can add up to a long-term strategy.

  

**Myth #4: Covered Calls force you to "keep losers and sell winners."**

  

It is easy to understand how this misconception came into being. If the stock price is above the strike price of the call on the expiration date, then assignment will cause that stock to be sold. This fosters the notion that one "sells winners." Also, if the stock price declines, then the call will expire worthless, and the stock position will be held. This fosters the notion that one "keeps losers."

  

At this point it is reasonable to ask, "Who (or what) is responsible for holding and selling stock positions?" Is the option responsible, or is the investor responsible? Where is it written that a stock that is sold, whether sold by assignment of a call or sold by an investor's conscious decision cannot be repurchased? Also, where is it written that a stock, which has declined in price, cannot be sold outright if it is not called away by an assigned call?

  

The point is that covered writing is not a passive strategy. Every investment must be managed if good results are expected. When the price of a stock starts to decline, then it is the investor's job to recognize the new trend and take appropriate action, i.e., sell. The IBD approach to investing has strict rules about liquidating positions that have declined by a pre-determined percentage. Other approaches seem to believe that investing is too subjective to have one hard-and-fast rule that fits all situations. Nevertheless, making decisions about selling stocks that are not performing is the responsibility of every investor. Stock positions must be managed. Investors do not abdicate these responsibilities when option strategies are used.

  

**Myth #5: You should only buy under-valued options and only sell over-valued options.**

  

It is also important to understand that "overvalued" and "undervalued" are subjective determinations that depend on a judgment about the current level of implied volatility relative to the history of implied volatility. While it might be possible to determine that one option is overvalued or undervalued relative to another option on the same stock, because its implied volatility is relatively high or low, it is virtually impossible to determine that a specific option is overvalued or undervalued on an absolute basis.

  

The most important element of a trading decision is the forecast for the underlying stock or index. The wrong way to select a strategy is to buy an option simply because some computer program says it is "undervalued," without any consideration for the direction of the underlying stock or index. If you buy an "undervalued" call and the stock price declines, then you will still lose money.

  

**Myth #6: Trading options is a zero-sum game.**

  

If you understand that options are insurance-like products, and if you accept the fact that some options are used to decrease risk, then it is easy to see that options are an essential part of the overall, growing financial marketplace.

  

Homeowner's insurance makes it possible for average people to buy a house with a bank loan without risking financial ruin if the house burns down. Business liability insurance makes it possible to engage in a variety of activities without having to set aside large amounts of capital to provide for unforeseen contingencies. In similar ways, life and health insurance also contribute to general economic growth by spreading risk.

  

Options add to liquidity and contribute to the growth of financial markets in a number of ways. First, options add value by giving investors more ways to implement their market research. With stocks alone, investors can only implement bullish or bearish strategies. With options, neutral market strategies, non-directional (high volatility) strategies and limited-risk bullish and bearish strategies are possible. This increase in available strategies brings in more participants, and more participants increase liquidity.

  

Options also make it possible for some investors to invest in equities when they normally would not be suited to do so. Consider a pension fund that is facing a known payment at some point in the future. To insure that the payment can be made, the pension fund manager might set cash aside now, thus withdrawing some funds from the equity markets. An alternative strategy, however, would be to protect targeted equity holdings with put options. If the market rises, then the equities participate. If the market declines, then the puts insure that the equities can be sold at a specific level, thereby guaranteeing that funds will be available for the pension fund's payment.

  

Another example of options making it possible for an investor to participate in equities when that investor might not normally do so is an income-oriented investor who engages in covered writing rather than purchasing bonds or cash-like instruments. Although the covered call strategy loses money if stock prices decline below the break-even point, bonds also have the risk of market price fluctuation. In such a case, options make it possible for an investor to participate in equities. Options, therefore, contribute to the growth of the equity markets.

  

**Conclusion**

  

Your chances of success are improved if you approach trading like a business. What is your method of market forecasting, and how will you apply that method? How will you manage your capital? How much time per day, per week or per month will you devote to trading?

  

Rather than worry about broad generalizations, such as the common myths about options discussed above, think about how you define success and make a step-by-step plan that will help you achieve that success.

Are you (1) afraid to be in the market and (2) afraid to be out? Is there a way to get the best of both worlds? Protecting a portfolio with index options may be just what the investment doctor ordered.

  

This article discusses how index put options can protect a portfolio just like homeowner's insurance protects a house. Any decline in portfolio value is expected to be reduced by the increase in value of the puts.

  

**Introduction**

  

There are six steps to understanding and implementing the Portfolio Protection Strategy. First, it is necessary to understand how traditional put options on individual stocks work. Second, the unique aspects of stock index options must be explained. Third, an investor must know the contract specifications of the specific put options under consideration. Fourth, the portfolio in question must be matched with a specific index, and fifth, the correct number of puts and the actual dollar cost must be determined. Finally, some subjective considerations must be discussed.

  

**The Basics of Put Options**

  

A *put option* is a contract giving the buyer the right to sell some underlying instrument at a specific price (the strike price) until some specific date (the expiration date). For this right, the put buyer pays an amount of money known as the *premium*. The seller of a put receives the premium and assumes the obligation of buying the underlying instrument if the put owner exercises the right. 

  

**Index Options Explained**

  

Whereas the "underlying instrument" of a traditional stock option is 100 shares of a particular stock, the underlying instrument of an index option is an index which does not exist in the same way that individual stocks exist. An *index option* gives the buyer the right to receive a cash payment, and the seller of an index option is obligated to make the cash payment if the option owner exercises. This process is known at *cash settlement*. 

  

Some of the more commonly known indexes on which index options are available are The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJX), The Standard and Poor's 100 Stock Index (OEX), The Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index (SPX), and the NASDAQ 100 Stock Index (NDX).

  

**Contract Specifications**

  

The dollar cost of an index option is the stated price times the index multiplier. Typically, the multiplier for index options is $100. Therefore, if an SPX 1700 Put is trading at "25," the price is $2,500 plus commissions (25  $100).

  

Matching a Portfolio with Specific Index Options

  

Unless a portfolio consists of the components that make up an index, the performance of the portfolio is unlikely to exactly match the performance of that index. Consequently, an investor must decide which index most closely follows the portfolio in question. A well-diversified portfolio might be thought to follow the S&P 500 Stock Index, and a portfolio consisting of blue-chip stocks might be thought to best match the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 100 Stock Index.

  

**Determining the Correct Number of Puts**

  

The correct number of index puts is based on the dollar value of the portfolio, not the number of shares. Assume, for example, the SPX is 1,700 and that an investor owns a diversified portfolio of stocks that follows the movement of the SPX closely. Also assume that the portfolio value is $500,000. Nervous about the outlook for the market, this investor decides to protect the portfolio value by purchasing SPX Index puts.

  

Exhibit 1 shows how the required number of index puts is calculated. The portfolio value is divided by the dollar amount that one put protects, which is determined by multiplying the current index level and the index multiplier. In this example, the index multiplier for SPX Index options $100, so 3 SPX puts are required ($500,000 / 1,700 x $100 = 3).

  

Dividing the portfolio value of $500,000 by the amount that one put protects, $170,000 yields the result of 2.94, or approximately 3 SPX put options. Consequently, this investor would purchase 3 SPX Index puts to hedge the $500,000 portfolio. If SPX declines below the break-even point at expiration as the investor fears, then the increase in the puts will reduce the decline in value of the equity portfolio.

  

Assuming 3 six-month SPX puts with a strike price of 1,700 are purchased for 70 each, or $7,000 per option not including commissions, then 3 puts could be purchased for $21,000 (3  $700) plus commissions, which is approximately 4% of the portfolio value.

  

If SPX declines 15% to 1,450 at June expiration, then the 1,700 puts will be worth 250 each, or $25,000 each, for a total value of $75,000 for 3 puts. This is a $54,000 increase in value over the $21,000 cost. The increase in value of the puts in this example partially offsets the $75,000 decline in the value of the equity portfolio. If the equity portfolio perfectly tracks S&P 500, which may not happen with a real portfolio, then an initial $500,000 equity portfolio would decline to $425,000 as the SPX decreased from 1,700 to 1,450. In this example, the $54,000 profit from the SPX puts partially offsets the $75,000 decline in value of the equity portfolio.

  

Exhibit 2 shows graphically how the Portfolio Protection Strategy and its component parts perform. Below the strike price of the put, the decrease in portfolio value is offset by the rise in value of the put. If the S&P 500 Index rises, then the equity portfolio can fully participate in the market rally, but the increase in portfolio value is reduced by the cost of the protective puts.

  

**Subjective Considerations**

  

Two issues not specifically addressed in this example are (1) selection of expiration date and (2) selection of strike price.

  

The time period during which protection is desired depends on the market forecast, and this is obviously a personal decision that each investor must make. Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between the length of time and cost of protection: the longer the time period, the greater the cost of the puts. But there is no "optimal" time period. Market forecasting itself is subjective, and, therefore, so is selecting the time period for which protection is deemed necessary. Investors who use the protective put strategy should be aware of the subjective nature of the decision in selecting an expiration date of the options and choose accordingly.

  

Selection of strike price, also involves a trade-off. When buying puts for protection, the trade-off is that a put with a higher-strike price generally costs more and has a higher break-even point. As a result, the protection offered by puts with higher strike prices is generally greater, because the break-even index level is closer to the current index level. Puts with lower strike prices tend to cost less and have lower break-even prices which are farther from the current index level.

  

**Summary**

  

The protective put strategy using index options may calm anxious investors who are afraid to stay in the market and, at the same time, are afraid to sell their stocks. While similar to buying insurance on a home, the protective put strategy has two goals. The first goal is to partially offset any decline in portfolio value if the market declines. The second goal is keeping the portfolio so that participation in a market rise is still possible.

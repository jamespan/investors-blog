**Covered Calls Review**

  

A covered call is a two-part strategy in which calls are sold on a share-for-share basis against stock that is owned. For example, "buy 500 shares and sell 5 call options" is a 500-share covered call position. One short call involves the obligation to sell 100 shares, so the five short calls in this example are an obligation to sell the 500 shares that are purchased.

  

**Example of a Covered Call**Today's date: September 16 (60 days prior to November options expiration)  
Price per share of XYZ Stock: $39.30  
Price per share of XYZ November 40 Call: 0.90  
Dividends paid between today and option expiration: none  
Covered Call Example:  
Price  
Action per Share  
Buy 400 XYZ (39.30)  
Sell 4 November XYZ 40 Calls 0.90  
Net (38.40)  
    
**Potential for Added Income**

  

The premium received from selling a covered call can be kept as income. Many investors use covered calls for this reason and have a program of selling covered calls on a regular basis — sometimes monthly or quarterly — with the goal of adding several percentage points of cash income to their annual returns.

  

**Risks of a Covered Call**

  

Covered calls lose money if the stock price declines below the breakeven point. The breakeven point is the purchase price of the stock minus the option premium received. As with any strategy that involves stock ownership, there is substantial risk. It is therefore important that covered call investors be willing to assume stock market risk.

  

**Static Return Calculation**

  

The static return is the estimated annualized net profit of a covered call, assuming the stock price remains constant until expiration and the call expires. For simplicity, returns are generally calculated on a per-share basis. To calculate a static rate of return, one needs to know five things, the purchase price of the stock, the strike price of the call, the price of the call, the days to option expiration and the amount of dividends, if any.

  

In the example above, stock was purchased at $39.30 per share, the 40 Call was sold for $0.90 per share, there were 60 days to expiration, and there were no dividends. Assuming no commissions, the static rate of return is calculated as follows:

  

Static Rate of Return  
= Income / Investment × Time Factor  
= (Call + Dividend) / Stock Price × (360 days per year/60 days to expiration)  
= (0.90 + 0) / 39.30 × (360 / 60)  
= 0.137 = 13.7%

  

Note: Return calculations assume that covered calls can be sold repeatedly over the course of a year in identical market conditions, thus the "annual" rate of return. There is no assurance, however, that this is possible. For this reason annual rate of return calculations must be interpreted very carefully.

  

**If-Called Return Calculation**

  

The if-called return is the estimated annualized net profit of a covered call, assuming the stock price is above the strike price at expiration and that the stock is sold when the call is assigned. For simplicity, returns are generally calculated on a per-share basis. To calculate an if-called rate of return, one needs to know five things, the purchase price of the stock, the strike price of the call, the price of the call, the days to option expiration and the amount of dividends, if any.

  

In the example above, the stock was purchased at $39.30 per share, the 40 Call was sold for $0.90 per share, there were 60 days to expiration, and there were no dividends. Assuming no commissions, the if-called rate of return is calculated as follows:

  

If-Called Rate of Return  
= (Income + Gain) / Investment × Time Factor  
= (Call + Dividend) + (Strike — Stock Price) / Stock Price × (360 days per year/60 days to expiration)  
= (0.90 + 0) + (40.00 — 39.30) / 39.30 × (360 / 60)  
= 0.244 = 24.4%

  

Note: Return calculations assume that covered calls can be sold repeatedly over the course of a year in identical market conditions, thus the "annual" rate of return. There is no assurance, however, that this is possible. For this reason annual rate of return calculations must be interpreted very carefully.

  

**Subjective Considerations**

  

Static and if-called rates of return are not the only considerations. Investors contemplating the covered call strategy should also answer the following two questions positively.

  

1. Are you willing to own the stock if the price falls?

  

2. Are you willing to sell the stock if the price rises?

  

1. The most important element of covered calls is the stock. If the stock price declines sharply, losses will increase almost dollar for dollar below the breakeven point. It is therefore important to focus on "good quality" stocks that you are willing to own through the inevitable ups and downs of the market.

  

2. Since covered calls involve the obligation to sell stock at the strike price of the call, you must think about that obligation. If you have a stock that you have owned for years and expect to own for years more, you really have to think hard about whether or not you want to sell covered calls on that stock. Also, if you have a sizable unrealized profit in that stock, then selling it could trigger a substantial tax liability. On such a stock, it might be best to not sell covered calls.

  

Generally, covered calls are best when the investor is not emotionally tied to the underlying stock. It is generally easier to make rational decisions about selling a newly acquired stock than about a long-term holding.

  

**Summary**

  

Covered calls offer the potential opportunity to add several percentage points of cash income to a portfolio's performance. However, the risk of stock ownership cannot be overlooked. For this reason, writers of covered calls should be willing to own the underlying stock, and they should also be willing to sell the stock if the price rises above the strike price of the call.

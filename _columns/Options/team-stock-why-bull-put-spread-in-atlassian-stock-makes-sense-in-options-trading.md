**Atlassian** ([TEAM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TEAM)) stock is currently one of my favorite stocks on which to trade options.




The stock has been bullish for a few months now. And during the dip in May, TEAM stock was very quickly snapped up by bullish traders.


Back in early May, we looked at selling an August-expiring, cash-secured put with a $155 strike price, and that trade has already profited to the tune of $545. But it's not too late to look at another options trade on this enterprise software industry group leader.


An easy bullish trade is a bull put spread. This is a defined risk option trade, so you always know the worst-case scenario. The trade will see a nice profit if the stock stays above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.

TEAM Stock: How To Build A Bullish Option Trade
-----------------------------------------------


Atlassian stock closed with serious momentum on Friday, up 3.91% on the day; so it continues to show significant accumulation. [According to IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-atlassian-corp-plc-cl-a-team.aspx), TEAM stock holds a bullish A- [Accumulation/Distribution Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-accumulationdistribution-rating-is-one-key-to-finding-great-stocks/) on a scale of A to E. An A indicates heavy net buying among funds over the past 13 weeks of trading.


![](https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wOPTIONS060120-300x170.jpg)With the stock currently trading around 185, it looks primed for a retest of the high at 190.


If a trader were to sell a July 17 expiring put with a 160 price strike and buy a July 17 150 put, they would generate around $1.60 in premium per contract, or $160 in cash.


The maximum loss potential in the trade would be $840, or the difference in the strike prices (150 and 160), less the premium received, then multiplied by 100.


This trade would be looking at a healthy 19.05% return in 1-1/2 months, provided TEAM stock finishes above 160 at expiry.


The maximum profit on the trade is limited to the premium received, which is $160. The maximum loss — $840 — would occur if TEAM stock finishes below 150 at expiry.


When To Cut Losses
------------------


It's best to cut losses before that point. For a trade like this I would set a stop loss if the stock broke below 170. If that were to transpire, I would admit I was wrong and try to minimize the loss by closing the options early.



Hopefully this trade works out as well as the cash secured put, but it's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) is consolidating in a tight range, having shown incredible strength this year. Nvidia stock is also above its 21-, 50- and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/) and could be setting up for a run toward 300.




Implied volatility is toward the lower end of the 12-month range, so it's better to look at debit spreads rather than credit spreads.


A bull call spread is a bullish debit spread that is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to the June expiration, a 285-strike call option was trading around $15.25 on Friday, and the 290 call was around $13.05.


Potential Profit Of $280
------------------------


Buying the 285 call and selling the 290 call would create a bull call spread. The trade cost would be $220 (the difference in the option prices multiplied by 100). And the maximum potential profit would be $280 (the difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid). *(An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect maximum profit.)*



A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy. So if Nvidia stock closes below 285 on June 16, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $220 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 290, so no matter how high NVDA stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $280.


The break-even price for the trade is equal to the long call strike plus the premium, which in this case would equal 287.20.


When To Cut Losses On Nvidia Stock Trade
----------------------------------------


In terms of trade management, if the stock dropped below the April 25 low of 262.25, I would consider closing early for a loss.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Nvidia stock is ranked No. 4 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 63 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 98.


Nvidia is due to report earnings in late May, so this trade would have earnings risk if held until then.

What will tomorrow bring? In front of Friday's anxiously awaited nonfarm payrolls data, does anyone really have clue? This option strategist is far from confident but open to the possibility for a decent-sized move in either direction to occur, given Wednesday's ADP private payrolls scare. That said, one market giant that's done its part to support the broader market, maintains liquid options and looks as though traders are bracing for a strong reaction is **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)). 

  

With shares stationed mostly in-between the Weekly June 190 call and 195 put and both seeing some fairly strong volume on fairly well-bid premium in front of tomorrow's expiration, readers are presented with a decent pure play on the jobs report as represented its strangle market. 

  

A strangle or straddle market like Amazon's gives insight as to trader expectations. With tomorrow's key data the one known catalyst on the calendar and the Weeklys expiring; we can see what type of price move traders think is possible. If we were in Vegas, this delta neutral position is kind of similar to an over / under line on a sporting event; although you get the drinks, amongst other things at those type casinos. 

  

Typically but not all the time, the pros or the house takes the short premium side of this bet and express their expectations in percentage terms regarding the size of the move in the underlying while using a confidence level of one standard deviation or "1 SD." This mathematical precept amounts to traders assigning a roughly two-thirds chance of the underlying being contained by the resulting estimated move. 

  

There's also the actual dollar cost or market price of the spread which readers can easily establish breakevens or an "under / over" with. The difference with this method is it mostly boils down to being a bit less dynamic. The general rule is that hedging the position during the course of the day, which might be possible and potentially very profitable, is not utilized as it is by likes of market makers and other seasoned pros.

  

So, just what are they thinking and feeling compelled to do? Well, late in the day the Weekly June 190 / 195 strangle market is priced at $1.15 per spread. Simply said, for the bears the breakeven is 188.85 if key technical support around 190 a share, is penetrated. And for the bulls, 196.15 is the required price to breakeven, with shares still enmeshed in a weekly flat base pattern of about five weeks. 

  

What about for those slightly more sophisticated option hedge hogs, using implieds of 37% and not-so-secret standard deviation formula? I arrived at a percentage move of 1.93% using a share price of 193.10, which results in breakevens of 196.82 and 189.37. So, how's that work? Along with the fore-mentioned hedging used by these more sophisticated traders in the event of a move tomorrow, it also helps to begin the position neutral-minded. Since the strangle actually maintains a small but positive delta of 13, we need to work that into the calculated breakevens by shorting shares as part of the overall position in order to get the spread delta neutral. And in doing so, we get much closer to a sometimes obscure but more secure truth of what others are doing and seeing as possible.

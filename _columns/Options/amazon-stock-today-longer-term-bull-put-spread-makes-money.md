**Amazon** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) stock recently broke back above the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/) and has shown improving [relative strength](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-relative-strength/). I'm willing to bet that the [Magnificent Seven stock](https://www.investors.com/research/magnificent-seven-stocks-latest-news-market-cap-weighting/) will remain strong between now and early next year, so let's look at a longer-term options play on Amazon stock.




Amazon has seen rising earnings per share in the last four quarters with each result exceeding analysts' expectations. From a technical perspective, Amazon stock is trading above the [21-day exponential moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), as well as the 50- and 200-day moving averages. 


**Amazon Stock Today**
----------------------


When it comes to options, we normally look at short-term trades. The time frame goes anywhere from one week to one month. Today, we will look at a longer-term bull put spread. Longer-term option trades tend to move a little slower than shorter-term trades. That allows more time to adjust or close. But it also means a lower annualized return.


As a reminder, a bull put spread is a defined-risk strategy. So, you always know the worst-case scenario in advance.


This type of trade will profit if Amazon stock trades sideways or higher, and even sometimes if it trades slightly lower.


**The Setup**
-------------


With AMZN stock trading around 183, if we use the March 21 expiration, we can sell a put option with a 165 strike price and buy another put at 160 to set up the bull put spread. That spread is trading around $1.25, based on recent data.



Selling this spread would generate roughly $125 in premium per set of contracts. This trade holds a maximum risk of $375.


If the spread expires worthless, that would be a 33.3% return in six months provided Amazon stock is above 165 at expiration. That seems like a pretty reasonable bet to me.


The 165 strike put has a delta of 24, which means it has a roughly 76% chance of expiring worthless.


The maximum loss would occur if Amazon stock closes below 160 on March 21, in which the premium seller would lose $375 on the trade. 


**Break-Even Spot**
-------------------



The break-even point for the trade in Amazon stock stands at 163.75, calculated as 165 less the $1.25 option premium per contract.


I would set an adjustment point or a stop loss if AMZN drops below 170. Otherwise, another good rule of thumb is to limit the loss to the amount of premium received — in this case $125.


Sticking to this stop-loss level will help avoid large losses if the trade goes south.


According to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), AMZN stock ranks No. 4 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 93, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 81 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 77.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Nikola** ([NKLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKLA)) has been making headlines recently with some explosive price moves. The electric-vehicle manufacturer was on fire in May and June rising from around 13 to 94. Just as quickly it dropped back down to 40 then rebounded to 54.24 as of Friday.




All that wild bouncing around means one thing — volatility; and that can be an option trader's best friend (or worst enemy, depending on the strategy). Traders wanting to take a directional bet on Nikola stock could do so via either a bull put spread or a bear call spread.


Given these types of stocks are flavor of the month, I would be inclined to look at a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiration.


To execute a bull put spread, a trader would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Nikola Bullish Option Trade
---------------------------


On the chart, 40 looks to be a good area of price support so I would look to place the spread around that level.


As of Friday, an Aug. 21-expiring bull put spread using the 40 strike as the short put and the 35 strike as the long put could be sold for around $3.15 per contract, which would generate $315 in premium.



The maximum risk on the trade can be calculated as the difference between the strike prices, less the premium received. In this case that would be $5 minus $3.15 which gives $1.85 per contract or $185 in total.


A profit potential of $315 with risk of just $185 sounds pretty good to me. Previous bull put spreads have had much different risk reward scenarios. The difference in this case can be attributed to the insanely high levels of volatility.


Nikola stock currently trades with implied volatility around 278%. Compare that to a much quieter stock like **Verizon** ([VZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VZ)), which trades at 24% implied volatility.


Nikola stock will likely experience considerable price swings in either direction, but this trade could do well if Nikola stock stays above 40 between now and August.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)) is a popular stock with option traders and is sitting right between the [50-day](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/).


Today, we are looking at an unbalanced iron condor, with a slightly bullish bias.




This can be achieved by trading more put spreads than call spreads.


An iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.


First, we take the bull put spreads. Using the April 17 expiry, we could sell two put spreads with the 525-520 strike prices. That spread could be sold for around $0.65 late Wednesday. Selling two contracts would generate $130.


Then the bear call spread could be placed by selling the 670 call and buying the 675 call. This spread could be sold for around $0.60.


Goldman Sachs Stock Trade Offers Bullish Bias
---------------------------------------------



Trading two put spreads for every one call spread gives the trade a slight bullish bias, but also more risk on the downside.


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1.90, or $190 of premium.


The profit zone ranges between 523.10 and 671.90. This is calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


The maximum risk is $810 on the put side and $410 on the call side.


If we take the premium ($190) divided by the maximum risk ($810), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 23%.


Exit Strategy For Goldman Sachs Stock
-------------------------------------


A stop loss in this case might be calculated based on 25% of capital at risk, or around $200.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-goldman-sachs-gs.aspx), Goldman Sachs is ranked No. 11 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 86 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90.


Goldman Sachs has earnings around April 14, so this trade would have earnings risk if held to expiration

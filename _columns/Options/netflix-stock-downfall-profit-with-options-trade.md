**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) has had a tough few weeks, with Netflix stock dropping from 350 to 188 following a disappointing earnings announcement.




When a quality company has a big drop like this, I like to use a strategy called a diagonal put spread.


This option strategy is an advanced strategy because it utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.


Let's look at an example.


The trade I'm looking at is selling a May 20 put with a strike price of 165 and buying a June 17 put with a strike price of 155.


As of Wednesday's close, the May 20 put could be sold for around $4.10 and the June 17 put could be bought for $4.90.


The net cost on the trade would be $80 and that is the most the trade could lose on the upside.


Maximum Risk On Netflix Stock Trade
-----------------------------------


The risk on the trade is on the downside, with a potential maximum loss of $1,080. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread (10) multiplied by 100 and adding in the cost of the trade (80).


The maximum potential gain is around $650, which would occur if Netflix stock closes right at 165 on May 20.


The trade has a nice profit zone in between 155 and 205.


Aiming for a return of around 10%-15% makes sense and I would set a similar stop loss.


The worst-case scenario is a sharp drop in Netflix stock early in the trade. For this reason, if the stock drops below 165 in the next few days, I would also consider closing the trade early to minimize losses.


Equivalent To Owning 1 Share Of Netflix
---------------------------------------


The initial trade setup has a delta of 1, meaning the position is roughly equivalent to owning one share of Netflix stock. Note that this delta number can change significantly as the stock starts to move.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Netflix stock is ranked No. 7 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 33, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 88 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 5.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

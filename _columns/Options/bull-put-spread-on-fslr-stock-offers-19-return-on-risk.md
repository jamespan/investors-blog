**First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) stock is one of the stronger solar stocks, ranking number three in the Energy-Solar Group. Solar stocks have been out of favor for a while but with oil stocks moving higher, solar stocks often get renewed interest. A bull put spread on FSLR stock offers a way to participate in the move with lower capital risked.




Bull Put Spread On FSLR Stock
-----------------------------


FSLR stock is showing an [IBD Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 72, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 67, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 77.


The technical action earned it a spot on [SwingTrader](http://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader&src=A011LPH) yesterday with the stock rising 3.7% and holding above a rising 50-day moving average.


Traders that expect strength in FSLR stock to continue could look at a bull put spread option trade.


To execute a bull put spread, an investor sells an out-of-the-money put and then buys a further out-of-the-money put.


For FSLR stock, we could use a Nov. 19 expiration and sell the 90 put while buying the 85 put to create a bull put spread.


This spread was trading for around 80 cents a share yesterday.



A bull put spread is a credit spread. That means a trader sells this spread and receives a credit of $80 in option premium. That's the maximum profit and is yours to keep should FSLR stock finish above 90 (the short put strike) at expiration.


If First Solar stock closes below 85 on the expiration date, the trade loses the maximum loss of $420. You can calculate the maximum loss by taking the difference between the strikes less the $80 premium received.


So you have a 19% potential return on risk in just over a month's time.


Managing The Trade
------------------


The breakeven point for the bull put spread on FSLR stock is 89.20. To calculate this, take the short put strike of 90 less the 80-cents-per-share option premium per contract.


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 7 which means it's similar exposure to owning seven shares of FSLR stock. This exposure changes over time as the stock price moves.


In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from 80 cents to $2, I would consider closing early for a loss.


With earnings set for late October, this trade has earnings risk, so keep that in mind.


Last week, we also looked at a [bull put spread on **Digital Turbine** (](https://www.investors.com/research/options/bullish-apps-stock-consider-bull-put-spread/)[APPS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APPS)). With the move in APPS stock, this can be closed early for a nice profit.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

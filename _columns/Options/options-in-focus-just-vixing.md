Entering the final half hour of Thursday's session, with the **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) off about -0.75% price action has confirmed a top. Whether it's "the top" is anybody's guess but following yesterday's 50% retracement test in the broad market proxy complimented by an indecisive doji finish. It seems some bears have come out of hibernation following a four-day run of higher highs and gains of about 8.5% from those recent lows to more recent highs. 

  

The good news for some bulls is the 1200 level and prior congestion resistance continues to hold and thus act as support. The bad news of course is tomorrow's monthly jobs data. I say that because based on the VIX and my opinion, for better or worse, the reaction could come in the form of a larger than normal price gap on the heels of the data. And that of course, always complicates matters, particularly so when conditions are ever volatile. 

  

So how'd I reach the conclusion the VIX could be setting the market up for a substantial gap, while maybe giving the directional edge to the bulls, but unwilling to bet the family ranch on tomorrow's ultimate outcome? It has to do with the market's most notorious sentiment gauge finding technical double-bottom pattern support off the historically overly fearful 30% level while flashing short-term complacency as it's traded more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average the past two sessions. 

  

Taken together, I see the VIX's testing of fearful historical levels and the shorter-term wherewithal to challenge that condition as a rather complex situation worthy of a dramatic resolution. Of course too and not to be ignored, underlying volatility has assisted in keeping prices in the VIX above 30% for the last few weeks. 

  

Even on those occasions which have brought smiles to faces of bulls such as the prior three trading days, the market's price action has continued to sport aggressive price swings more worthy of owning protective premium rather than simply discounting the volatility with short premium strategies in anticipation of quieter conditions moving forward. That day will come and I think we're almost there, but first there's that jobs report and then in the aftermath, some likely recalibration of volatility going forward that should make life easier for hard nose bulls and bears.

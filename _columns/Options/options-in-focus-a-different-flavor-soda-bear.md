With shares of **SodaStream Intl.** ([SODA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SODA)) reversing hard into a bearish engulfing candle pattern following a quick pop to fresh and effervescent all-time-highs; it seems the stock may be saying that a technical Co2 booster is going to be required before new highs might be struck.

  

On the option side, improving but still mostly difficult to trade markets did find some interest in the July contract. Quotes in the front month are still a tad wide in the surrounding money contracts on average. However, actual customer order flow rather than having to rely on the kindness of market makers does provide some opportunities here and there, if one is patient.

  

With in-the-money contracts generally $0.50 to $0.80 wide between the bid / ask of an individual call or put, traders will likely gravitate towards the at and out-of-the monies which are tighter, but generally not strong enough to provide for positioning outside of an outright (long or short) or vertical.

  

One bearish combo using the two fore-mentioned strategies that might stand a reasonable chance at getting filled if the trader is willing to price the spread at slightly worse than mid market prices while allowing the stock to draw in the other side of the position intraday, is the capped risk reversal.

  

A capped risk reversal sells a bear call vertical and simultaneously purchases an out-of-the money put. This strategy allows the trader to bet bearishly at a substantially reduced cost or even a credit. The downside is the upside but unlike a regular risk reversal which simply sells a call, this position puts a definitive cap on that risk by purchasing the higher strike call to establish the vertical.

  

With shares near 74.35 intraday, one hypothesized spread of this type which has seen fairly close volume in all three strikes is the July 80 / 85 call spread and the July 70 put. The day's most heavily traded contract, the July 65 put on volume of about 1,500 also might make sense as part of this package on either a one-to-one or ratio basis of two long puts for every sold call spread.

  

Of the three spreads, only the July 80 / 85 call in conjunction with the July 65 put can be done for a credit, but the cost for bearish exposure is radically reduced for the other capped risk reversal plays.

Is it over? Well, if you're asking about whether or not the S&P 500's three sessions of lower lows from its established intermediate highs has completed, you might posit whether a pullback of 1.8% is enough. As most healthy pullbacks, but not one's which completely unravel, show declines of at least 2%, the market could almost be there. 

  

If you look at Thursday's lows just a hair away from the 1400 level and one which more or less helped secure the market's recent highs, bulls might also have a bit more ammo on their sideâ€”or nearly so. An additional and important clue to all traders we hope, regardless of whether they position with options or not, is the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX). 

  

With the S&P 500's reversal of the last three days, fear, and not the kind tied to the fear of missing out, has been building in the market's most notorious sentiment gauge. In fact, since last Friday when investors confidently pushed the index down to a five year low of 13.30 in a somewhat vain attempt to collect a smidgeon of weekend decay, premiums have pushed right back for four straight sessions. In closing at 16.01%, prices are successfully working their way back into their more historical trading range of 15% to the low 20s.

  

Why is that good? Much like with a pullback in a stock needing to work off an overbought situation in a healthy manner, seeing VIX premiums, which represent protection from volatile market downturns, make a move from near-complacent like conditions to today's nearly there highs, is ultimately a good thing. "Nearly there?" As with the fore-mentioned 1.8% and hair's distance from 1400 in the S&P 500; a differential of 12.25% in the VIX relative to its 10-day simple moving average still has a little wiggle room for improvement; but not much, if a pullback is going to remain of the healthy variety.

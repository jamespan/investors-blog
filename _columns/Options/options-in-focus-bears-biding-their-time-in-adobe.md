Let's face it, we'd always like to be proven presciently correct in a heartbeat with our directional prowess. However, most of us would probably agree there's a lot more of that zig and zag pattern that goes on, before and if, we might have the opportunity to buy a round of victorious drinks at the Bull & Bear bar on the corner of Wall & Main

  

As much, it appears one or more option traders may feel a similar sort of way as evidenced by some slightly out-of-the money put activity in **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) which could suggest some longer-term calendar trading may have taken place. With ADBE off by about -3.3% but rebounding from intraday lows following the company's disappointing earnings report, two option series in particular caught my eye today, the July and January 2012 30 puts. 

  

Both contracts traded rather heavily compared to surrounding strikes with volume of 3,400 and 2,800 respectively. With large open interest and my Time & Sales tool going "Klunk!," it's hard to know for certain if the concentrated volume is related and even if they are, whether a roll was involved or not. In defense of a multi-month calendar, with shares nearing 32 in rangy post earnings action, vega risk has been reduced compliments of ADBE's volatility crush in its option premiums. 

  

  

Secondly, this same softer delta bearish trader would be allowing him or herself the opportunity to make one or more and perhaps a handful of rolls to collect premium against the longer-term contract. If they're able to accomplish that feat, at some point the January 30 put could be held as a standalone bearish position for a below market price or even a credit; if those daily, weekly and monthly zigs and zags cooperate while confounding other hardnosed bears in the process.

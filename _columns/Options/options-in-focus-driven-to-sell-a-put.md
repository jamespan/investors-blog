Often enough my interpretation of the market is no better than the next guy's and with whom, along with many others, vie for attention within this vast arena known as cyberspace. But, while my proper buy points and the likes may be faulty from time-to-time. However, I do strive to make more prudent and well-thought-out choices with regards to option strategizing. The other guy, I'm less sure about. 

  

Case in point, today in my email I received the proverbial green light to go out and sell **General Motors** ([GM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GM)) Weeklys March 26 puts for $0.24 per contract or better. In fact, what some would call a targeted purchase or cash-secured put, this market strategist deemed as "Instant Cash." The simple math of collecting $24 for each contract sold, if shares remain above 26 for the next two days, amounts to a razzle-dazzle, "annualized return of 52%!!" 

  

For disclaimer purposes, our GM bull didn't use exclamation points, but everything else is accurate. So is this strategist's odd or jumbled interpretation of GM maintaining a "very heavy overhang" in the stock due to Uncle Sam's ownership, but outlook of 10% of upside in shares before investors need worry about the actions of short-term traders selling out of positions. Darned day traders! 

  

The analysis and subsequent conclusion of what to do in GM is an odd one in our opinion. But what's really worse is two-fold. First, is the lack of attention to downside risk other than noting each contract to be shorted would require $2,600 to establish a cash-secured short put. That said, just because you have the funds, does mean that's your stop loss. Ironically enough and implicit in this lack of money management is the fact GM already showed put sellers what bankruptcy can mean beyond the theoretical.

  

Secondly and sadly enough, this strategist could have recommended a bull put spread for literally and figuratively only $0.03 to $0.04 less "Instant Cash" than his cash secured put sale. What's more, this secure stop loss, other than the cash-as-collateral option, isn't a catastrophe stop points away from the cash machine touted. 

  

At the end of the day or really two in this case, with one point and liquid strikes offered, the trader could have sold the Weeklys March 26 / 25 bull put for $0.20 with a max loss of $0.80 per contract or the outright put for $0.24 and exposure of $25.76â€¦however unlikely one might see that as being.

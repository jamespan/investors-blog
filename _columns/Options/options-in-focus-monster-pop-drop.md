IBD 50 constituent and beverage upstart **Monster Beverage Corp** ([MNST](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MNST)) saw its shares explode higher intraday Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported the company could be in talks with the world's largest soft drink maker, **Coca-Cola**  ([KO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=KO)). 

  

The massive and volatile price spike which saw shares almost touch $84 compared to Friday's close near $65.50 and pierce the $14.0 billion capitalization mark didn't go unnoticed by option traders and activity sporting a strong bias favoring calls by a three-to-one margin. 

  

Overall demand for long call and protective put strategies sent front month implieds up towards 65% and a test of two year highs and the June contract into the low 50s. Compared to statistical volatility in the mid-20s to mid-30s, traders are pricing in further above-normal movement. The largest concentration of such demand is the June 80 calls, which were briefly in-the-money and now about 5% to 6% above the current share price. 

  

A jump in implieds of about 50% from near 36% to the low 50s, coupled with the intraday surge in share price has resulted in the June 80 call having an ultra-wide trading range from a low of $0.20 to a high of $8.00. That said, with a current price of $3.50 and virtually no open interest; we also strongly suspect some of today's obvious opening activity has already done a fair bit of ultra-fast money closing and for better and also worse in a market that takes two to consummate the trade.

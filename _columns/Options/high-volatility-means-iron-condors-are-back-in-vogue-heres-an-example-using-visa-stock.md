Volatility is up across the board, with [the VIX](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility) closing Wednesday at 31.12, the highest level since February. 




High volatility means iron condors become more attractive with many stocks seeing the highest IV (implied volatility) readings in the past 12 months. 


Take **Visa** ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) for example, which is currently showing an IV Rank of 98.03% and an IV Percentile of 99%. That means the current level of implied volatility on Visa stock is just about the highest we've seen in 12 months. 


When volatility is high, the iron condor can be placed further out of the money, giving the trade a higher chance at success. 


Taking Advantage Of Visa Stock Volatility
-----------------------------------------



Let's look at an example using Visa stock. 


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. 


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction. 


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Jan. 21 expiry, we could sell the 170 put and buy the 165 put. That spread could be sold Wednesday for around 75 cents per share. 


Then set up the bear call spread, which could be placed by selling the 215 call and buying the 210 call. This spread could be sold Wednesday for around 60 cents. 


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1.35 per contract, or $135 of premium for a block of 100 shares. 


Profit Zone For Visa Iron Condor
--------------------------------


The profit zone ranges between 168.65 and 216.35. You can calculate this by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received. 


As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 — 1.35 x 100 = $365. 


Therefore, if we take the premium ($135) divided by the maximum risk ($365), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 37%. 


If price action stabilizes, then iron condors will work well.


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $135, so we could set a stop loss at 1.5 times the premium, or a loss of around $205. 


Using Visa Stock Chart To Set Targets
-------------------------------------


Another way to manage the trade is to set a point on the chart where the trade will be adjusted or closed. That could be around 180 on the downside and 205 on the upside. 


Visa stock is ranked No. 9 in the credit card and payment processors group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 58, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 89 and a  [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 23. 


The company won't announce earnings until Jan. 25, so this trade should have no earnings risk. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

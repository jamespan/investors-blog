The fascination with credit spreads as compared to debit spreads can't be denied. Or can it? The fact is if there were a systematic advantage, it would be exploited, arbed out and become non-existent. Case in point, did you know an out-of-the-money bull put spread initiated for a credit is the same as buying an in-the-money bull call spread for a debit when dealing with identical strikes and the same contract month? Well, if you didn't, you should.

  

Aside from out-of-the money puts sometimes having better liquidity provision, the risk and reward of the two verticals are identical, as well as what needs to be put up in the trading account. What? You didn't think that credit was really for free or at an advantage over the call vertical did you? For instance, on a vertical such as a 2.5-point bull put spread, if you take in a credit of $0.50, your broker will demand you have capital on hand to sufficiently cover the risk of two points. 

  

At the same time, if and in most instances the same strike call vertical can be negotiated in the open market for a debit of $2, this likeminded bullish investor is tying up two points of capital (times the number of spreads) until proven differently. At the end of the day or umm, at expiration, maybe the debit spread also results in a capital gain of $0.50. Likewise, maybe the various accounting of the two verticals will show losses of $2. 

  

The one real benefit of the put spread is the opportunity on occasion to close out just the short put and maintain the further away long put for the longshot payoff with no real extra risk involved if it's far enough away from being in the money. In this situation, the trader with the bull call spread would need to exit their position in full or otherwise face large delta risk which could wipe out their paper profits and turn into a loss.

  

On the other hand, an early assignment for the bull call spread would allow that trader to maximize his or her profit potential before expiration or maintain a synthetic long put with no risk. While admittedly this type event is unlikely, it can happen on occasion and could prove a nice quicker-than-expected gain or an even nicer windfall if all went, not entirely as plannedâ€”and certainly not how the trader using a put credit spread and still open, would like to see things turn out.

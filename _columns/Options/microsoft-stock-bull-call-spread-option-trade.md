Microsoft stock is currently showing an implied volatility reading that is the lowest we have seen in 12 months. That means options for **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) are cheap right now compared to recent history.




When that occurs, it's better to be a net buyer of options rather than a [seller](https://www.investors.com/research/options/long-term-option-trade-idea-on-tilray-stock-offers-62-potential-return/).


Technically, Microsoft stock is holding above the 21-, 50- and 200-day moving averages.


Microsoft stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 76, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 95 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 43.


Microsoft Stock: Bull Call Spread
---------------------------------


Traders wanting to take some bullish exposure in a risk-defined way could look at a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.


Going out to the September expiration for Microsoft stock gives the trade plenty of time to work out, and also minimizes the impact of time decay. On Tuesday, a 250 strike call option for Microsoft stock was trading around $12.55 and the 260 call was around $8.50.



Buying the 250 call and selling the 260 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $405 (difference in the option prices multiplied by 100) and the maximum profit potential would be $595 (difference in strike prices, multiplied by 100 less the premium paid).


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if Microsoft stock closes below 250 on September 17, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $405 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 260, so no matter how high Microsoft stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $595.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to MSFT stock using options.


Trade Management
----------------


In terms of trade management, if the spread dropped from $4.05 to $2, I would consider closing early for a loss; otherwise I would hold to expiry.


As a long-term trade, this position would have exposure to earnings risk.


This bull call spread trade has a delta of 8 which means it is a similar exposure to owning 8 shares of MSFT stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) took a huge tumble Wednesday and broke through the 200-day moving average. Today, we're going to look at how to set up a bearish option trade, called a bear call spread. 




A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call. 


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways, and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiry. 


On Tesla stock, a March expiry bear call spread could be set up using the 850 strike as the short call and the 855 strike as the long call.  On Wednesday, that spread was trading for around $1.30. 


If executed at that price, the maximum profit on the trade would be $130 per contract. The maximum risk is $370. 


The spread will achieve the maximum profit if Tesla stock closes below 850 on March 18. In that case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the trader to keep the $130 option premium.  


 The maximum loss will occur if Tesla closes above 855 on March 18, which would see the premium seller lose $370 on the trade. 


Risk Of Trade Is Known
----------------------


While some option trades have the risk of unlimited losses, a bear call spread is a risk-defined strategy, and you always know the worst-case scenario in advance. 


A stop loss could be set if Tesla trades above 830, or if the spread value rises from $1.30 to $2.60. 



Because this is a bearish position, traders who think Tesla stock could move higher from here should not enter this trade.  


Tesla stock is ranked No. 2 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 74, and [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 74 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 53. Those ratings reflect Tesla's poor performance recently. Shares sank to August 2021 lows on Thursday.

Shares of IBD 50 and NASDAQ 100 component **Citrix Systems**  ([CTXS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTXS)) are treading on below average volume late trade Monday with a fractional gain of about 0.30% compared to equally minor losses in the broader market. Despite the ennui in shares of CTXS, one or two large traders have stepped up to the plate in its options and putting the name atop our "very" Unusual Option Activity list for IBD 50 stocks. 

  

Compared to average option trading of about 1,800, volume is running nearly 400% above normal in CTXS options with just over 9,000 contracts traded. Of that hefty activity, which tops fellow IBD 50 constituent TJX Companies' 375% volume increase, 70% of the trading is from two block-sized prints.

  

Specifically, the out-of-the-money August 85 calls saw a block print of 1,870 for $1.50 a bit after 2:00 PM EDT. Several seconds later 4,150 closer, but still out-of-the-money August 72.5 puts changed hands for $2.70. With open interest negligible on both strikes and the prints so close together in their timing it wouldn't be a stretch to see the opening volume as tied to the same trader. 

  

The problem with trying to tie the two options together is being able to walk away with a combined position, which makes sense at some basic level. A ratio strangle which would either buy or sell both contracts doesn't add up as the combination doesn't shrink delta risk by any authoritative amount and which might otherwise allow for an "ah-ha" moment.

  

Likewise, with no sign of stock being tied to either print, a ratio fence or ratio risk reversal, which would have the trader either buying calls and selling the puts or inversely selling the calls and buying the puts, doesn't really fit either. Here, while both contracts use the same positional delta of either long (+) or short (-), this type spread is most commonly executed when the sale of the one contract offsets the dollar cost of the other. 

  

In the case of Citrix today, with the put costing roughly 60% more than the call and having been put up 4,150 times compared to the call's 1,870 contracts. Dollar neutral positioning so common to the risk reversal is out the window. Because of that feature, we'd be hard-pressed to think one trader put up both options and the timing aspect, purely coincidental.

  

So, what's left? With implieds bid to marginal relative highs near 50% for the ATM strike in front of next week's earnings release on July 25, we'd estimate the put was purchased and maybe there was a separate buyer of the call since joining the two options together doesn't really seem to serve a purpose as described. 

  

However, due to the fact implieds aren't screaming higher and technically speaking, CTXS looks to have faltered in recent days below its 50-day simple moving average; we'd say there's room for today's call action to have been initiated by a seller positioning against recent highs and potential resistance. Net, net while today's unusual volume is more unusual than normal, we think a bear or more likely, two, are at work in CTXS.

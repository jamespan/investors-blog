Have you ever seen heavy in-the-money call action that's failed to move the stock and wondered what on earth might be behind all those traded contracts? In most instances when you're seeing really, out of this world and concentrated volume in deep calls with large existing open interest, the activity is likely tied to professional traders attempting to capture a stock's dividend before the ex-date. 

  

How does that work? First, the trader typical buys and sells deep vertical spreads multiple times in front of the ex-date for the same price throughout the session with other like-minded traders attempting the same play. The trader then exercises the long call contracts from both the bull and bear spreads. This is allowed even if they net out to zero at the end of the session due to a loop hole compliments of the Options Clearing Corp. 

  

From that point and if Lady Luck makes an appearance, the trader can be left with a bunch of buy-writes if the other guy i.e. the large open interest, is asleep at the wheel and fails to remember to exercise their own long call position in order to collect the dividend.

  

If and that's a big "if", if Lady Luck is kind and the trader winds up not getting assigned on some of his or her calls, they stand to make a quick windfall that's equal to the price of the dividend payout minus the put value (if any) on the strike in which the trader failed to receive a call assignment on. The reason the put value is important is any buy-writes that are now on the trader's sheets are the synthetic equivalent of a short put. As much, until that risk is tidied up or expires out of the money; there is risk beyond the dividend captured through this play.

  

Aside from Lady Luck being required, as the assignment process on the existing open interest is lottery style according to the O.C.C., it should be appreciated commissions play a large factor in making dividend plays viable or not. Despite, the advantageous rate schedules many off floor traders now enjoy, capturing the dividend is still mostly a prohibitive game when nickels and dimes are the prize that a trader is trying to capture. And for the heftier dividend plays that might amount to fifty-cent pieces or maybe more? The payout would certainly be greater, but the potential of walking away with any short contracts is, in our estimation, even less likely.

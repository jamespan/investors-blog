**Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) has been unstoppable lately as its retaken its all-time highs from 2021. With earnings due on Feb. 1 after the closing bell, the options market offers a way to participate in a Meta stock move with less capital at risk.


Today we'll look at how to do that using a bullish diagonal spread with an attractive reward-to-risk ratio.




 


Setting Up A Bullish Option On Meta Stock
-----------------------------------------


A bullish diagonal spread is a trade that involves buying a call option and selling a shorter-term call option against it.


In the case of Meta stock, we can buy the Feb. 9 call at 390 for a cost around $1,310. At the same time, we can offset part of that cost by selling the Feb. 2 call with a 397.50 strike. That call option generated around $910 in premium.


The result is a net cost for the trade of $400 per spread, which is also the most the trade can lose.



What does Meta stock need to do for the trade to be successful? If it can gain a few percentage points by Feb. 2, trading around the 397.50 strike, the diagonal spread achieves a max profit around $1,200. The actual amount will vary depending on changes to implied volatility, but still, it's a nice reward-to-risk ratio.


Goal Of The Trade
-----------------


The idea with the trade is that if Meta stock trades up to around 395-400, the diagonal spread increase in value, resulting in a net profit.


A bullish diagonal spread is a good way to gain some upside exposure on a stock without risking too much if the move doesn't eventuate.


The combined position has a net delta of 9, which means the trade is roughly equivalent to owning 9 shares of Meta stock. Of course, this will change as the trade progresses.


A suggested stop loss level is a close below 360, a little bit lower than its 21-day moving average line and an area of support from Jan. 17.


Before earnings, stocks exhibit a high level of volatility skew and this trade takes advantage of that. Your achieving that by selling the short-term, high volatility calls and buying the lower volatility calls.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Meta stock is ranked No. 11 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 95 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

**Royal Caribbean Group** ([RCL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=RCL)) moved 4% higher Tuesday on increased volume and [broke out to a new high](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-mixed-nasdaq-powers-higher-nvidia-stock/).




The stock does not pay a dividend, but savvy investors can still create a yield from Royal Caribbean using covered calls.


A covered call involves buying 100 shares of the underlying stock and simultaneously selling a call option against those shares.


Selling calls limits the upside but increases the yield from the investment in the form of option premium.


The investor keeps the premium generated from selling calls no matter what happens with the stock.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Royal Caribbean stock is ranked No. 1 in its group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 81 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 94.


Selling Long-Term Calls On Royal Caribbean
------------------------------------------


When trading covered calls, most investors sell monthly calls against their stock to make the most of the effects of time decay.



That makes a lot of sense but also requires a lot of active management.


What if we sold yearly covered calls against Royal Caribbean stock? Let's take a look.


A June 20, 2025 call option with a strike price of 165 can be sold for around $24.60, generating $2,460 in premium per contract.


Purchasing 100 shares of Royal Caribbean will cost around $16,070, but the net cost can be reduced by the $2,460 option premium received.


Therefore, we have created a yield (2,460/13,610) in 387 days, which is 18.07% or 18.33% annualized.


That sure beats the dividend yield on most stocks in the current market and still allows for around $430 of capital appreciation.


Royal Caribbean Covered Call Advantages
---------------------------------------


Covered calls are a fantastic way to generate extra income from a stock holding while also providing some downside protection.


Investors would need to weigh the pros and cons of the stock before initiating a bullish trade like a covered call.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Option traders' busy in front of **Teradata**'s ([TDC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TDC)) earnings release Wednesday, likely wish they hadn't been so dedicated after the stock enjoyed a well-received bid on overall strong earnings results. But based on Thursday's order flow in the puts, it also appears many of those determined bears aren't calling it quits just yet. However, we suspect what we're about to suggest isn't what you might be thinking. 

  

Discussed last night, heavy lopsided put activity laid out as the work of bearish speculators in the out-of-the-money August 60 put saw a closing price of $1 per contract (and one well-traded intraday for $1.10 to $1.15) on implieds of 60% turn into a put fetching $0.22 by the close of trade due to the pressures of a negative delta, volatility crush and time decay on its premium. 

  

Checking the board for a second day, with shares up about 2.1% near 67.5, of yesterdays assumed 2,500 or so opening contracts, barely more than 100 contracts have traded in the August 60 strike put. Alone, it would seem those bears are resting comfortably despite the paper loss and a range high of $0.55 suggesting a much smaller loss of about 50% loss might have been possible during the opening minutes of an ill-fated "sell the news" bout of profit-taking. 

  

However, Thursday's most active August 65 strike which traded more than 4,200 contracts compared to open interest of about 2,000 makes for the interesting observation of at least a few of yesterday's bears potentially reinventing themselves as bulls; well kinda, sorta. Given today's report, overall supportive reaction and the bulk of the 65s trading for $0.95 to $1.10. There's the off chance that instead of capitulating with a closing loss on the 60 put, traders may have legged into a bull put spread. 

  

"Really?" We'll be the first to admit selling a bull put spread for a small debit to possibly even money, isn't a great way to turn a profit. In fact, the best one could do is lose the amount paid or breakeven. There's also the risk of a max loss of around $4.00 based on our prices on the five-point vertical versus the $1.00 - $1.15 originally paid for the outright 60s. That said, with shares near 67.50 and just over two weeks left until expiration, if TDC remains above the 64 area, this sort of legged vertical will prove no worse to the trader's bottom-line and perhaps assist in getting them much closer to or even breaking even if TDC is above 65.

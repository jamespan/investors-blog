NASDAQ 100 constituent and one-time growth star **Dell** ([DELL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DELL)) announced its latest results last night and in the process broke most technical and maybe fundamental hopes the stock and company, were on the rebound. Option traders were also taken by surprise relative to Wednesday's earnings reaction fallout. 

  

As of the close, DELL is off a rather stiff 17% thereabouts in a price move made all the more dramatic by its sharp opening gap which easily took a longstanding uptrend line from the March 2009 bottom. However, in preparation for today's reaction in shares, option traders weren't exactly betting on the winning number. 

  

Checking last night's closing board, at-the-money June options were certainly priced rich with implieds of around 40% mostly double statistical underlying volatility while narrowly scoring fresh four month trading range highs. However, with 23 calendar days remaining for the front month contract, the implieds were implying, pardon the pun, traders pricing in a 68% chance DELL shares would remain within 10% of last night's $15.08 close. 

  

The pricing it turns out, while steep, wasn't nearly appropriate for the occasion. With shares near $12.50 and off -$2.60, that's a bit more than the $1.50 associated with the one-standard deviation figure of 10%. In fact it's 1.7 times. And in the real world where price gaps can also happen, as with DELL, and not allow for continuous hedging, this collective error of sort's means those shorting premium in front of the earnings event, as with an ATM short straddle, would be showing significant losses. 

  

At the end of the day, well today at least, a close-to-close move has resulted in the straddle finishing up 100% from a price of $1.25 to $2.50, but more or less now acting like an in-the-money put. Of course, there's still time on the clock until the June contract expires to hold the position. But to us that seems more attached to holding out for hope and even more risky than the initial bet wagered wrongly, but more calculated nonetheless.

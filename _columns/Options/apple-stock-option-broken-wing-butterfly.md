**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is on my radar today, and the trade I'm looking at has no risk on the upside and a healthy profit zone on the downside.




The strategy is called a broken wing butterfly, and we'll use puts because the short strike will be below the stock price. This helps to reduce assignment risk.


With a regular butterfly option trade, the wings are placed an equal distance from the short strike, but with a broken wing butterfly we leave a larger gap on a particular side.


This results in less risk on one side and more risk on the opposite side.


Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on Apple stock.


* Buy 1 May 17, 165 put @ 2.15
* Sell 2 May 17, 175 put @ 4.30
* Buy 1 May 17, 180 put @ 6.05


Notice that the upper strike put is 5 points away from the middle put and the lower put is 10 points away.


No Upside Risk On Apple Stock Trade
-----------------------------------


This broken wing butterfly trade could be placed for a slight credit of around $40, which means there is no risk on the upside.



The worst that can happen is all the puts expire worthless, leaving the trader with about a $40 return.


On the downside, the maximum loss is $460 and the maximum gain is $540.


The ideal scenario for the trade is that Apple stock stays between 170 and 180 for the next few months or so.


The trade starts with delta of 5, so it has a slight bullish bias to start. But that will flip to negative delta closer to expiry if the stock is still above 180.


Stop Loss For Option Trade
--------------------------


In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss if Apple broke below 170 and a profit target of 10%-15%.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-apple-aapl.aspx), Apple stock is ranked No. 2 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 72, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 94 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 51.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

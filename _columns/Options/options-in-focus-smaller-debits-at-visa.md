Top-rated credit card issuers **MasterCard**  ([MA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MA)) and **Visa**  ([V](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=V)) are displaying relative strength gains of about 1.5% and 2.2%, respectively Tuesday afternoon, while sporting healthy looking basing patterns in Tuesday's second half. The price action is also garnering the attention of option traders Tuesday as robust average daily activity of about 3,000 and 5,000 contracts has swelled to 7,200 and 17,000.

  

For their part, option traders in Visa are most active in the regular surrounding money September 130 and 135 calls on virtually identical volume of 2,300. With larger open interest, the initiation or closing of positions becomes more difficult to approach. However, a fairly stiff jump of about 15% from around 20% to 23% in its near-term options, which includes its Weeklys, which expire on Friday, suggests evidence of buyers dictating the order flow. 

  

While bullish-driven buyers appear to be in control of the action, given the increase in implieds, nearness of expiration and the dollar pricing on today's most actives, we like the idea of approaching the September 130 and 135 calls as a vertical spread. With shares at 131.37 intraday, the vertical can be purchased for a debit of $2.05 and below its mid or saddle value of $2.50. That's important to remember as it allows for potentially quicker spread gains in the direction of its $5.00 maximum as dictated by the distance between the two strikes. 

  

At current prices the vertical's expiration breakeven would require a move of only about 0.50%, while capturing the max profit of $2.95 could be fully realized with a rise of less than 3% over the next 10 calendar days. At the same time, the spread's dollar risk compares to an outright purchase price of either $2.60 for the slightly in-the-money 130 call or $0.60 for the out-of-the-money 135 call. 

  

Generally, our preference for this type of vertical is for it offer a slightly better savings of 30% versus the 21% debit reduction of $2.05 compared to $2.60 if purchasing the lower strike 130 call. To enjoy that benefit the spread would need to be priced in-between $1.90 to $1.95. However, given the pricing does work on a couple levels already discussed and what's looking like more than just window-shopping in the stock. Thus, we'd say this smaller debit still has the earmarks of a nice purchase; relatively speaking at least.

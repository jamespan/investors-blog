**Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)), a superb winner during a number of bull markets after the dot-com bear market bottomed, continues to get ample attention. Today's column features a long call calendar spread trade in [Netflix stock](https://www.investors.com/research/netflix-stock-buy-now/).




With earnings season beginning, and data on December U.S. consumer prices coming in a bit hot, traders are dipping us into regions that traders are looking to engage. Put another way, prices may appear more favorable in the [overall bullish context](https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/) of the market. 


Several stocks are [hitting new 52 week highs](https://www.investors.com/search-results/?query=52%20week%20highs), and so [Netflix](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/netflix-ad-tier-subscribers-tops-23-million-users-nflx-stock-jumps-into-buy-zone/), a recent showcase in the [IBD Stock Of The Day](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/) column, is where I will focus today. Earnings arrive in less than two weeks, on Jan. 23. Therefore, time plays a key part of the decision when considering the trade below.


Some of us will choose to wait until after the earnings release to take the trade. And some may choose to position ourselves in front of the move.


View the long call calendar spread as a neutral to bullish position. It estimates prices will rise over the longer term to deliver stellar results. We can take advantage of any dips in the market to position in the stock of our choice while holding on to the position through any big spikes. 


Netflix Stock Today: The Long Call Calendar Spread
--------------------------------------------------


Let's consider a trade setup in this fashion:


* Sell to open 1 NFLX Feb. 16-expiration call with a 510 strike price
* Buy to open 1 NFLX March 15 510 call


Total debit in this trade? It comes out to $4.83 per share for a set of contracts, or $483 for a block of 100 shares.


This means the break-even cost for the trade in Netflix stock lands at 514.83, or the price of the first long option strike plus the cost of the option.



The ideal strategy result gives us four choices to exit the trade. 


One, sell the entire calendar spread once it carries an acceptable profit. Two, sell the entire calendar spread once it hits your loss threshold. 


Also, you could sell the entire calendar spread with a swift upward price right after entering the trade — with more than 2 weeks to expiration of the February strike. And finally, allow the short call strike of the calendar to expire worthless and then determine if you would like to create a new spread by selling another call against the March 510 call. This will turn the March event into a long call spread, but this limits potential upside.   


Defending The Trade
-------------------


Stock hunting using fundamental and price strength [within the IBD methodology](https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-live-qa/ibd-live-faq-helpful-links-answers-to-questions-about-zoom-charts-ibds-methodology-more/) is where I firmly plant myself under the backdrop of the current economic backdrop. I use [technical analysis](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis/) to find ideal buying opportunities in conjunction with the tools for strength seen on IBD.   


The goal of taking the calendar trade is to gain exposure to profit but to significantly limit loss if we are incorrect.


Options sellers are positioned to win in two ways — the stock does nothing, or the stock moves within the ranges, so we use this concept to minimize the risk of market exposure. 


 **Trade Management: Key** **Chart Levels In Netflix Stock**
------------------------------------------------------------


The monthly resistance zone sits near $500, and support sits near $470. If we see some sharp dips, we will be in a position to potentially add to the position as long as market indicators show increased probabilities of more upside. This will increase your risk, so think this through. Be patient in the current flow and realize that there are some macro events that could result in volatility. 


Consider these scenarios for this trade in Netflix stock:


* The stock dips lower after earnings news on Jan. 23, but does not break 470 for more than three days. Such action shows itself as favorable to the traders looking for longer-term growth. We should look for bounces in Netflix stock in the days following to confirm strength of the chart.
* Netflix stock grinds higher much earlier in the cycle. The option position increases in value by more than 100%. In this case, we could certainly choose to sell the entire position, freeing up more capital to trade.
* NFLX shares grind higher, test or breaches 510, but immediately retreat. This suggests traders are not willing to pay more for the stock at the present time. Ideal if it occurs in the near term and into the February expiration strike.
* Stock breaks down on volume for more than three days and breaks our personal risk thresholds, and so we exit the trade.
* We must consider closing or adjusting this trade if the stock creeps to 510 as we approach February expiration. We will have to surrender the March-expiring call option to cover the in-the-money February strike.


As with all trades, consider what you like about holding the position in the first place. Consider your risk carefully. Be patient and allow price action to move around a range of your stops.

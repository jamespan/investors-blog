With **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) stock trading around 131, we are looking at setting up a calendar spread at the 130 strike that gives the trade a roughly neutral outlook.




A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Usually this is done with monthly options, but it can also be done with weekly options.


Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias in which case they would use puts.


Selling the February 19th 130 call option will generate around $470 in premium, and buying the March 19th 130 call will cost around $680.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $210 per spread and that is the most the trade can lose up until the first expiration.


The estimated maximum profit is $240 but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if JPM stock remains around 130 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay at a faster rate than the bought option, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 124 and 136, but these can also change slightly depending on the impact of changes in implied volatility.


Calendar Spread in JPM Stock Is A More Advanced Options Trading Strategy
------------------------------------------------------------------------


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.


I would set a profit target of 25% and I would set a stop loss if JPM stock breaks through either 124 or 136.


For a trade like this I would risk not more than 2-3% of my capital.


Calendar spreads are a neutral option trading strategy. Bullish traders might consider something simpler like a bull put spread, similar [to this trade in DocuSign stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/docusign-stock-bull-put-spread-can-profit-with-stock-above-250/) or this [bullish calendar spread on AAPL stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/aapl-stock-calendar-spread-offers-limited-risk-upside/).


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

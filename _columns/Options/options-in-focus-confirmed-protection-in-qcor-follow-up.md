It seems just like yesterday that we were discussing IBD 50 constituent **Questcor Pharmaceutical**  ([QCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOR)) as a bearish risk reversal strategy for existing long shareholders to protect potentially well-extended technical gains with a bit more authority than with using a stop loss in shares. In fact it was just yesterday. 

  

Admittedly, our timing for the piece could have been a case of dumb luck. But with QCOR off about 20% during Tuesday's final hour after notorious short-selling boutique Citron Research stated shares would trade in the single digits in the next six months due to questionable marketing tactics regarding its sole drug Acthar, our discussed legged collar strategy is looking that much smarter than its typical safe haven self. 

  

In our opinion, investors' long shares of QCOR got off easy using a stop loss in the stock. The bearish note hit the newswires early in the session and trading remained continuous, albeit trending aggressively lower, rather than a technical situation punctuated by an overnight price gap or intraday trading halt.

  

Of course, a collar of this design with the traditional lower strike protective put hasn't improved a bull's paper profits. To have that kind of foresight and profited further from today's fallout, the trader would need to have sold a lower strike call and purchased a higher strike put. That type of strategizing synthetically creates a bear vertical on QCOR versus our mused synthetic bull call vertical. 

  

In the end, a limited-risk collar like described on QCOR would have kept the bulk of a bull's profits intact if positioned in an ordinary way around yesterday's share price near 57.50 using the 55 put and 60 call in either July or August. Whether a trader now wishes to be really "dynamic" and possibly roll down the collar and add to the position size, might be considered. 

  

It may not be for everyone, including Citron Research we suppose, but given the price drop of nearly 20%, QCOR is now in a position to adjust a collar and possibly accumulate up to 20% more stock. While the risk is increased, adding shares on weakness and adjusting the options to fit around the new share price (if one is still bullish) helps increase one's profits on the upside while still allowing for well-contained and reasonable losses should the stock not oblige technically.

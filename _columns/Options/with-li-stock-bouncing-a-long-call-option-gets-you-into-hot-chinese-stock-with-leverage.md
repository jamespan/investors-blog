**Li Auto** ([LI](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LI)) saw a massive bounce off the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) Tuesday in a very bullish move.




Li stock looks primed for a test of the 52-week high around 47 per share and is one of the [best Chinese stocks to buy now](https://www.investors.com/news/best-china-stocks-to-buy-now/).


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), LI stock is ranked No. 1 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 81 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 98.


Investors who think Li stock will continue to rally and don't want to risk significant capital can use long call options rather than buy the stock outright. This can be a good way to protect precious capital in these volatile markets.


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (strike price) up until a certain date (expiration date).


Call Options Provide Leverage
-----------------------------


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage. (This can be both a good and a bad thing.)



Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of Li stock, he or she would have to invest around $4,300 at the current price.


Instead, the investor could gain a similar exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option. One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.


If investors were to buy one Li Auto 40-strike call option expiring on Dec. 15, they would only need to invest around $680 rather than $4,300.


The break-even price for this call option is equal to the strike price plus the premium paid, which would make the break-even price 46.80.


Most At Risk Is $680
--------------------


The most the trade can lose is the premium paid of $680, which would occur if Li Auto finished below 40 on Dec. 15.


However, if LI stock shoots higher, the upside is unlimited.


Using options in this way can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock without risking as much capital as would be required to buy the stock outright.


Savvy traders can further reduce the risk by selling an out-of-the-money call, turning the trade into a bull call spread.


For example, selling the Dec. 15, 50-strike call would reduce the trade cost by around $280 but would also limit the upside above 50.


A stop loss could be set if Li stock drops 8% from the entry point.

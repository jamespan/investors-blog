"Only on Wall Street?" Shares of **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)) took a technical hit Tuesday courtesy of a sinister sounding character called The Dark Knight. Time Warner announced the popular Batman installment will face off against Netflix in its stock and trade of streaming videos as Warner Bros. Entertainment is now offering selected titles in its library for rent or purchase, beginning with the fore-mentioned caped crusader.

  

With the market outlook turning towards one sporting a corrective position just last night according to the Big Picture, one position idea for the more cautiously-aligned who also wish to deploy an ironclad bottom-line profit and top-line risk graph, irrespective of where the cards may or may not fall down the road, is the long put condor. 

  

As earnings are slated for April 20, a March or April position allows this softer delta bear to position without taking on earnings exposure, not worry about mixed premiums with little tradable edge and drastically reduce one's theta or time decay risk compared to a surrounding money long put purchase.

  

  

To illustrate and shown above, readers are looking at a two lot regular March 195 / 185 / 180 / 170 long put condor. Shares will need to still improve upon Tuesday's bearish high volume breakdown of 50-day simple moving average support in order to gain profitability and have actual intrinsic value come expiration. However, if the Wall Street saying of "All gaps eventually get filled" proves correct and bulls get further carried away into trendline support; this bearish long condor should make The Dark Knight less of a menace where it matters most.

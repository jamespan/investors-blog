Over the last few weeks, we have been looking at the concept of expected range for a stock over an earnings announcement. **Etsy** ([ETSY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ETSY)) has stayed within the expected range following five of the last six earnings announcements.




Etsy stock is showing a good [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-ibd-composite-rating/) of 90, a best-possible [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 99 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 76. The stock appears to be fashioning the right side of a [new, large base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/investor-basics-why-learning-base-patterns-gets-the-ball-rolling/), such as a cup pattern. A [potential handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/cup-with-handle-everything-you-need-to-know-about-handles-in-bases/) may form, too.


So, let's analyze how we can structure an option trade that fits the view that 1) we think Etsy stock will stay within the expected range; and 2) the response to the earnings report is likely to be positive.


Etsy is slated to report quarterly earnings on Aug. 4.

Etsy Stock: Fashioning A Bull Put Spread
----------------------------------------


Taking the at-the-money put and call for the Aug. 6 expiration, we can see that the expected range is 10.1%. Now that we know the expected range, let's find a bull put spread that has the short strike roughly 10% below the stock price.


Selling the Aug. 6-expiration, 180-strike put and buying the 175 put would create a bull put spread.


This spread was trading for around 75 cents Wednesday. So, a trader selling this spread would receive $75 in option premium for a 100-share block, and would have a maximum risk of $425.



That represents a 17.7% return on risk between now and Aug. 6 if Etsy stock remains above 180.


If Etsy closes below 170 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $425.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 179.25; you can calculate this as 180 less the 75-cent option premium per contract.


Higher Level Of Risk In This Trade
----------------------------------


There is little room for adjustment with short-term trades such as this one in Etsy stock held over earnings. A 17% return in a few days would be nice, but the possibility of losing 100% is also very real. As such, this style of trade is only for traders with a high risk tolerance.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

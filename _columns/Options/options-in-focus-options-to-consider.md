With option trading and unlike with simple long stock positioning in shares of a company, it's not enough to just be a bull or bear if one is going to be successful consistently. While you may not realize it, there are important Greek factors other than delta (direction), which make up how calls and puts trade and react in relation to the underlying at any given time.

  

At a minimum and to be a more well-informed directional strategist, a trader should know the potential impact of variables such as time decay (theta), implied (vega) and statistical volatility, dividends and possibly interest rates (rho), depending on one's time frame or commitment to the position.

  

Another important factor to consider when dealing with an option position is the provision or absence of liquidity in the related call and put markets. Less than desirable conditions require extra thought as to whether a spread, or outright for that matter, is even worth entering into when prices look theoretically promising. Bearing in mind, all the fore-mentioned variables will ultimately put option traders well on their way to locating stronger positions than otherwise possible.

  

Admittedly, options might not be traditional stuff by some standards. By definition, options are a derivative bet with a limited contract life compared to shares, which theoretically, have no expiration date. Yet, given that call and put positions can act just like stock, control risk in ways that buying or shorting shares simply can't guarantee, as well as allow for other types of desired market exposure. Thus educating oneself to these types of opportunities seems a smart move for investors.

  

After rolling up your sleeves and understanding how a spread such as a vertical would react to a volatility crush or what a time spread post earnings might look like; you may still find options won't be your primary investment vehicle. However, to suggest calls and puts don't have a place amongst proper buy points, square box patterns, high level double bottoms and the likes just seems a bit silly given the competitive nature of ever sophisticated markets.

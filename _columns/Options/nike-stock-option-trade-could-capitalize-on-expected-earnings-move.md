**Nike** ([NKE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NKE)) is set to report earnings next Thursday after the close, with an expected move of around 8%. On Thursday morning, Nike stock fell in sync with the market.




Nike stock is below the [21-](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-21-day-exponential-moving-average/), [50-](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) and [200-day moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-baidu-breached-key-support-line-before-diving-bidu/) and put in a bearish candle Wednesday.


Let's analyze how we can structure an option trade that fits the view that 1) we think Nike stock will stay within the expected range, and 2) the response to the earnings report is more likely to be negative.


Taking the at-the-money put and call for the Sept. 30 expiration, we see that the expected range is 8%.


Now that we know the expected range, let's find a bear call spread with a short strike at least 8% above the stock price.


Trade Setup For Nike Stock Ahead Of Earnings Report
---------------------------------------------------


Selling the Sept. 30, 110-strike put and buying the 115 put would create a bear call spread.


This spread was trading for around $0.50 Wednesday. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $50 in option premium with a maximum risk of $450.



That represents an 11.11% return on risk between now and Sept. 30 if Nike stock remains below 110.


If the stock closes above 115 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $450.


The break-even point for the bear call spread is 110.50, which is calculated as 110 plus the 0.50 option premium per contract.


There is little room for adjustment with short-term trades such as this held over earnings. Short-term trades also contain assignment risk.


Trade Could Be Total Loss
-------------------------


An 11% return on Nike stock in a few days would be nice, but the possibility of losing 100% is also very real.


As such, this trading style is only for traders with high risk tolerance. And traders should use appropriate position sizing.


Depending on how Nike stock trades today, traders may prefer to wait for a price higher than $0.50 for the spread.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Nike stock is ranked No. 8 in its industry group, and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 45, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 60, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 26.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

For trading the bearish side of the market, put options offer traders a limited-risk alternative to shorting stock. This article first reviews the basics of buying put options, and second, a real stock recently highlighted in IBD’s Leader Board is discussed.

  

**Put Option Basics**

  

A put option gives its owner the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price until the expiration date. An XYZ April 75 Put, for example, gives its owner the right to sell 100 shares of XYZ stock at $75 per share at any time until the third Friday in April.

  

If the stock price is above the strike price of the put at expiration, then the put expires worthless and the purchase price plus commissions are lost.

  

If the stock price is below the strike price of the put at expiration, however, then the put increases in value dollar for dollar with the stock price decline. Using the April 75 put mentioned above as an example, if the stock price declines to $60 at expiration in April, then the April 70 Put will have a value of $15 per share. If the put was purchased for $3.00 per share, then the profit will be $12.00 per share.

  

Note that the break-even stock price at expiration is $72 in this example, which is calculated by subtracting the price of the put from the strike price (75.00 — 3.00 = 72.00). Typically, the break-even price for a put is below the current stock price on the day the put is purchased. So the stock must decline in price for the put to break even, and the stock must then decline further for the put to make a profit.  So why buy puts if shorting stock can start to make money immediately?

  

**Buying Puts — Advantages and Disadvantages**

  

Compare two strategies: shorting stock and buying an at-the-money put. Both strategies face the risk of a rising stock price, but the risk with the put option is truly limited, while the risk of short stock is unlimited.

  

Position 1:                         Position 2:  
**Short Stock:                   Long At-the-Money Put Option**Short 100 XYZ @ $75    Buy 1 April 75 Put @ 3.00

  

Compare the results under three different scenarios:

  

**Scenario 1: Stock Declines $15 to $60 at Expiration of April Options (April 19)** — With XYZ stock at $60 the trader who shorted 100 shares at $75 has a paper profit of $1,500, not including commissions. The trader who purchased the April 75 Put at 3.00 has an unrealized profit of $1,200. The 75 Put in this example has a value of 15.00 per share, or $1,500, for one put on 100 shares. Subtracting the cost of 3.00 per share, or $300, yields the profit of $1,200. Although the option profit is $3.00 per share less in absolute dollar terms, the initial investment of $300 was substantially less than the margin deposit required to short a $75 stock. Also, the risk of buying the put is limited to 3.00 per share, but the risk of shorting stock is unlimited.

  

In most cases a put option will be sold at or prior to expiration, but the put can be exercised it the trader wants to keep a bearish position in the stock. Exercising a put means that 100 shares of stock are sold at the strike price, and, assuming shares are not owned, then a short stock position is created. So, the former put owner has a short stock position and assumes the corresponding risk.

  

**Scenario 2: Stock Price Unchanged at $75 at Expiration** — With the stock price unchanged, the trader with a short stock position breaks even. The 75 Put, however, expires worthless for a loss of 100% of the cost of the put plus commissions. Another consideration is that the put no longer exists, while a short stock position is still open. Therefore, the possibility of a stock price decline exists, although the risk of a stock price rise also exists. 

  

**Scenario 3: Stock Rises** — With XYZ stock at any price above $75.00 in this example, the trader with a short stock position has a loss, and possibly a substantial loss. The loss from the put, however, is limited to 100% of the cost of the put plus commissions no matter how high the stock price might rise.

  

**Current Example — ALXN**

  

Although the market’s rally has reduced the number of stocks on the [Leader Board Cut List](http://leaderboard.investors.com/leaderboard/cutlist/), one stock on the list — Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) — posted its second straight high-volume decline on Friday. Alexion fell 2% in more than double its average daily turnover, ending the week with an 8% loss. Most of the damage was done Thursday, when the stock reversed lower and sank 5% despite a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report. “The one-time leader has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic short-sale set up. But the market's uptrend makes any short-sale attempt risky.”

  

If you believe that the recent decline in ALXN is just the start of further downside action, then put options give you a limited-risk opportunity to participate in the stock price fall you forecast at a fraction of the per-share risk of shorting stock.

  

With ALXN trading at 86.00 near the close on Friday, February 15, the ALXN May 85 Put was offered at 5.40 per share. This put has a breakeven stock price of $79.60 (strike price of 85.00 − cost of the put of 5.40 = 79.60), so the stock price must fall to this point for the purchased put to break even at expiration. Below the break-even price at expiration, however, the put participates dollar for dollar in any stock price decline. Risk is limited to the cost of the put no matter how high the stock price might rally.

  

**Summary**

  

Purchasing puts allows you to participate in the downside potential of a stock. The risk of buying puts is limited to the price paid plus commissions. Learning to use options in your trading activities involves mastering new dynamics, but many investors believe that learning to use options is worth the effort. Options offer strategy alternatives that have different risk-to-reward ratios, different break-even points, and potentially different stock-price ranges of profit and loss.

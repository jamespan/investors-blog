Well so much for traders discounting the broader market to levels sufficiently oversold as to afford a "buy the news" response in front of late Friday's S&P downgrade of US credit. Instead, an oversold market on more than a few quantitative and qualitative levels based on the VIX and S&P's own price action has beget more of the same.

  

In this type environment where literally a five minute candlestick can produce head-spinning volatility similar if not larger than a normal day's trading range, it's nice to know that if you're going to participate, that limited-risk alternatives using calls and/or puts with or without stock is possible.

  

Personally, last week's action into late Thursday gave this strategist a false read on what the immediate future would hold. Heavy, capitulation type volume in the **S&P 500 ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) options and a near repeat and fearful test of the VIX's March highs, looked good for a playable bounce and maybe even a grander bullish design of intermediate importance. "Doink!"

  

In the here and now of Monday's final hour, the likes of the S&P500 is some 5% lower and price volatility on top of the heady percentage loss continues to be the most severe since the worst the financial crisis circa 2008 â€” 2009 had to offer. As for the VIX and the market's most notorious gauge of sentiment, it's appreciatively surged from a fearful 32% to an incredibly panicked and risk averse 48% at intraday highs and levels squarely testing those set during 2010's Flash Crash.

  

All told, conditions now more than ever, are ripe for a sharp reaction in the other direction. But due to the underlying volatility, playing for such a move becomes increasingly tricky business. The view is there's an increased likelihood of large gaps into potential resistance, which ultimately steal the ability to bargain-hunt. As much, if you're going to go that route and not wait for the likes of a follow-through day, consider the option of structuring a position with a limited risk spread.

  

Verticals are a great way to play price direction while removing potential implied volatility risk. And in more liquid markets, positioned butterflies modified to one's risk tolerance might also be looked at. Of course neither offers a guarantee of profits. But if a concrete amount of risk exposure in the market sounds good in an environment where value is increasingly elusive, options like those are the way to go.

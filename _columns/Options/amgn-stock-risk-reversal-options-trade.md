**Amgen** (AMGN) stock has recently put in a series of higher highs and higher lows while the 21-day and [50-day moving averages](http://What Is The 50-Day Moving Average, And How It Tells You When To Buy Or Sell Growth Stocks | Investor's Business Daily) have started to turn upward.




Bullish traders wanting to take some upside exposure can do so via an options trade called a risk reversal. Risk reversals are bullish trades that involve selling an out-of-the-money put and using the proceeds to purchase an out-of-the-money call.


On AMGN stock, this type of trade would only be appropriate for large traders as the maximum risk is around $24,000.


Let's take a look at how a risk reversal trade might look on Amgen stock.


Going out to the June 2021 expiration gives the trade plenty of time to work out. The June 240 put can be sold for around $15.80 per contract. Those proceeds can then be used to purchase a June 250 call option which was trading around $13.60 per contract on Friday.


As the sold put is slightly higher than the bought call, the trader receives a credit into their account of $2.20 per contract or $220 in total. However that is definitely not the most the trade can lose. The 240 put has a total loss potential of $24,000 which would occur if AMGN stock went to zero.


The trade will initially perform similar to a long stock position and will profit as the stock rises, and suffer losses if the stock falls.



The risk reversal has a delta of 91 which means the combined position is roughly equivalent to owning 91 shares of AMGN stock. At expiration, if AMGN stock is between 240 and 250 both options expire worthless and the trader makes $220 in profit.


Larger profits at expiration will occur above a price of 250 and the higher the stock goes, the better for this trade. There is no limit to the profit potential.


For a trade like this, I would risk no more than 2% of my account and having a stop loss if AMGN stock breaks through 235 would also be a good idea.


Counting against the stock from a bullish perspective is the less than impressive ratings with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 68, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 88 and an [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 17. However, the RS Rating has shown improvement over the last month.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

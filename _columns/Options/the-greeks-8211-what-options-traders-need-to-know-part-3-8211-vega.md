How and why option prices change is a mystery to many options traders. This is the third in a [series of](http://news.investors.com/investing-options/070313-662478-the-greeks-and8211-what-options-traders-need-to-know-part-1-and8211-delta.htm) [articles](http://news.investors.com/investing-options/070913-663011-the-greeks-and8211-what-options-traders-need-to-know-part-2-and8211-gamma.htm) that discuss the seemingly complex topic of options price behavior and the "Greeks."

  

**Introduction**

  

Volatility is a well-known input to the many formulas that are used to estimate prices of options. Mathematicians might argue over which formula is "best," but for most individual investors, the differences in estimated option prices are minor.

  

In addition to volatility, the other five inputs are the stock price, the strike price, the time to expiration, the prevailing interest and dividends.

  

Exhibit 1 shows how a typical option pricing computer program takes the six inputs and calculates the outputs, which are the theoretical price of the call and put. The mathematics involves advanced calculus and is beyond the scope of this article.

  

If volatility never changed, then "the volatility" for each stock would be well known and widely available; and option traders would simply estimate option prices using the known level of volatility for the particular stock being traded.

  

Unfortunately, as Exhibit 2 illustrates, volatility fluctuates widely and frequently. The graph in Exhibit 2 shows the levels of historical volatility for Apple stock and the implied volatility for Apple options over the past 12 months. The graph reveals that historical volatility of Apple stock ranged from a low below 20% to a high over 50%. It also shows that implied volatility of Apple options varied from a low near 20% to a high near 45%. For options traders, the graph in Exhibit 2 shows that changing levels of volatility is a challenge that must be dealt with.

  

**Vega Defined**

  

If a volatility changes as Exhibit 2 indicates, then is it reasonable to ask, "How are changes in volatility measured?" Fortunately, options traders have a tool for this, the vega. Vega is the estimated change in option price for a one percentage point change in volatility.

  

Exhibit 3 is a repeat of Exhibit 1 with the addition of column 2. The difference between column 1 and column 2 is that the volatility assumption has been increased from 25% to 26%, a one percentage point increase. 

  

In Exhibit 3, note that the "vega of 0.13" means that "a one percentage point increase in volatility from 25% to 26% causes the price of the 90 Call to rise by 13 cents from 2.95 to 3.08. It also causes the price of the 90 Put to rise by 13 cents from 3.35 to 3.48." Thus, vega is stated in the same units (dollars and cents) as the option price. This is different than delta, which is stated in percentage terms.

  

**Is Vega Useful?**

  

Although computer programs are widely used to estimate option prices for traders' forecasts, an understanding of vega can be helpful.

  

Referring back to Exhibit 2, look at the period from mid-September to mid-October of 2012 during which time volatility of Apple options rose from approximately 25% to approximately 40%. In retrospect, assuming a vega of approximately of 0.20 (20 cents), then a rise in volatility from 25% to 40% caused the option price to be 3.00 (+15 x 0.20) higher than it would have been given the same stock price and time to expiration and a volatility level of 25%.

  

Similarly, again referring back to Exhibit 2, during the period from late February to late March, 2013, the volatility of Apple options dropped from approximately 35% to approximately 25%. Assuming a vega of approximately of 0.20, then this decrease in volatility caused the option price to be 2.00 (−10 x 0.20) lower than it would have been given the same stock price and time to expiration and a volatility level of 35%.

  

**Using Vega in Planning Option Trades**

  

Volatility histories, such as illustrated in Exhibit 2, are available free of charge on the Web site of the Chicago Board Options Exchange ([www.cboe.com](http://www.cboe.com)) and from iVolatility ([www.ivolatility.com](http://www.ivolatility.com)), and this historical information is useful in two ways.

  

First, volatilities tend to rise and fall in a consistent range. Exhibit 2 indicates that, during the last year, volatility of Apple stock and Apple options had a low of 20% and a high of 45%. Although there is no guaranty that volatilities for Apple stock and options cannot fall lower or rise higher, option traders can have some confidence that 20% volatility for Apple is "low" and that 45% is "high," at least on an historical basis.

  

Second, Exhibit 2 and similar graphs show how volatility levels fluctuate before and after earnings reports. Again, while there is no guaranty that the future levels of volatility will mirror levels in the past, the information in Exhibit 2 gives traders valuable information for making trading decisions.

  

**Conclusion**

  

Vega estimates how much option prices change when the volatility level is changed by one percentage point. Traders who know the vega of their positions will have a quick estimate of how much changing volatility will affect their profit or loss. Historical information about levels of volatility can be helpful in making current option trading decisions, because volatility tends to rise and fall in consistent rages.

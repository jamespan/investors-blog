The implied volatility in **InMode** ([INMD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=INMD)) jumped through the roof recently. It has an Implied Volatility Percentile reading of 100%. That means the current level of implied volatility is at its highest point in the past 12 months. An iron condor option trade on InMode stock could be a way to take advantage.




Iron Condor On InMode Stock
---------------------------


[Iron condors](https://www.investors.com/research/options/how-trading-an-iron-condor-option-strategy-in-amd-stock-could-yield-33-percent-return/) use a strategy that is best placed when implied volatility is high. Placing the iron condor further out of the money gives the trade a higher chance at success. As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. Let's look at an example using INMD stock.



First, we take the bull put spread. Using the November 19 expiry, we could sell the 55 put and buy the 50 put. That spread traded yesterday for around 90 cents per share.


Then use the bear call spread. Using the same expiration, we could sell the 90 call and buy the 95 call. This spread traded for around 40 cents yesterday.


In total, this iron condor on InMode stock generated around $1.30 per contract or $130 of premium for a 100-share block. When implied volatility is high, you usually want to be on the side of selling premium.


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction.


Managing The Trade
------------------


The profit zone ranges between 53.70 and 91.30 for INMD stock. Calculate this by taking the short strikes at 55 and 90, then add or subtract the premium received.


As for the risk, since both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 — 1.30 x 100 = $370.


Therefore, if we take the premium ($130) divided by the maximum risk ($370), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 35%.


If price action stabilizes, this iron condor will work well. However, if INMD stock continues to bounce around, the trade will suffer losses. That is a risk, especially since InMode stock went through [climactic action](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/why-the-climax-run-is-top-gun-of-a-sell-signal-taser-made-one-in-2004/) recently. That's why [Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) removed it from its Leaders List.


So far, the price action shows resilience but the aftermath of a climax top can be brutal.


One way to set a stop loss for an iron condor is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $130, so we could set a stop loss at 1.5 times the premium or a loss of around $195.


Another way to manage the trade is to set a point on the InMode stock chart where the trade will be adjusted or closed. That could be around 60 on the downside and 82.50 on the upside.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

With just under two hours left in Wednesday's session, a broad-based turnaround by the S&P 500 into the plus column has helped lift **Green Mountain Coffee Roasters** ([GMCR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GMCR)) to apparently some not-too-hot-to-handle all-time highs. Last night we discussed the technically extended situation and what appeared to be rather unimpressed option activity in the name. 

  

We went on to illustrate an at-the-money August 110 / 115 bear call spread as a way to play GMCR for a profit under declining, flat and even modestly higher prices. The one type technical situation to stymie the position unfortunately turned up in Wednesday's session with the stock tacking on a scintillating 4.3% to 111.30 intraday. 

  

The price action finds GMCR smack dab at our spread's expiration breakeven but showing paper losses of -$1.20 as the vertical trades for $2.30. The reason for the unwanted expansion prior to expiration has to do with the position's short delta and building short gamma with not much time left on the clock (relatively speaking). 

  

With shares where they are, the 110s are now in the money and hold both intrinsic and even larger levels of extrinsic value being so close to at-the-money. At the same time, our protective 115s are still out-of-the-money by 3% thereabouts and maintain lesser time premium relative to the 110.

  

Today's unwanted spread action is the downside of verticals that are close to expiring. Losses, while limited risk, will rack up quicker in the interim relative to a vertical on the same strikes that's placed further out in time. The simple reason is probability analysis essentially dictates that given more time, there's an increased chance for shares to move in the other direction—and in the case of our vertical, for it to go out worthless. 

  

In the end, where there's risk there's reward and our illustrated position assumed a bit of extra risk; albeit what we thought was strategic in its application. However, being out -$1.20 compared to maybe breaking even at current levels some sixteen calendar days out or possibly even losing up to -$3.90 in a stock that's quickly made our analysis taste like day old coffee —seems sufficient reason to exit with a tighter loss.

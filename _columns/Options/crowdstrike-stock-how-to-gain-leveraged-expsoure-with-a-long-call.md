CrowdStrike stock rallied 10% last week and cleared a downward- sloping trend line. **CrowdStrike** ([CRWD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRWD)) gets pretty good ratings from IBD, including a [Composite Rating](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nasdaq-crowdstrike-holdings-a-crwd.aspx) of 90, a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 96 and an [Earnings Per Share Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 76.




Investors wanting leveraged exposure to CrowdStrike stock can do so via an option strategy called a long call.


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (strike price), up until a certain date (expiration date).


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage. But this can be both a good and a bad thing.


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of CRWD stock, they would have to invest around $14,500 at the current price.


Instead, the investor could gain the same exposure using a fraction of the capital by purchasing a call option.



One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.


CrowdStrike Stock: Call Option
------------------------------


If an investor were to buy one CrowdStrike call option with a 110 strike price (March 2021 expiration), they would only need to invest around $4,050 rather than $14,500.


So what happens in the unlikely event that CrowdStrike stock goes to $0? The investor loses only $4,050 while still maintaining a similar exposure to the gains.


The CRWD 110 call option gives the investor the right to buy 100 shares of CrowdStrike stock up until the expiration date.


The call option costs around $40.50 so the investor would need CRWD stock to rise above 150.50 (strike price plus premium paid) in order to be profitable on the investment.

There is always a risk with trading on leverage like this. If CRWD stock drops below $110 at expiry, the investor would lose 100% of the investment, which is the $4,050. An investor holding 100 shares on the other hand would lose around $3,570.


Watch For Break Of Support
--------------------------


Buying a call option is just one of numerous possible option strategies, but it is a very easy one for investors to start with.


If CRWD stock dropped below the 50-day moving average, currently around 137, I would rethink the trade or close it early to avoid further losses.


CrowdStrike earnings are scheduled for December 2, so this trade will have earnings risk. The options market is currently pricing in a 14.5% move in either direction.

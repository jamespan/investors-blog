**Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) broke out to a new high this week and continues to show impressive strength. A cheap way to gain upside exposure on Microsoft stock is via a bullish calendar spread.




A calendar spread is a trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price.


Calendar Spread Setup For Microsoft Stock
-----------------------------------------


Here's a setup for Microsoft stock using Wednesday's closing prices.


With Microsoft stock trading around 221, you could set up a bullish calendar spread at a 230 strike price.


Selling the 230 call option expiring Sept. 18 would generate around $385 in premium. Buying the same strike, the 230 call, but a month later, with the Oct. 16 expiration, would cost around $775.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $390 per spread, the most the trade can lose.

The estimated maximum profit is around $500, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


If Microsoft stock trades up to around 230, the calendar spread increases and results in a net profit.


The break-even prices for the trade are around 217 and 244.


I would close this bullish calendar spread if Microsoft stock rallied to 230 or if it dropped back below 210.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

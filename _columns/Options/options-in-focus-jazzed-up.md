By some measures **Jazz Pharmaceuticals** ([JAZZ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JAZZ)) is a name worth watching for growth bulls. Shares are staging a cup-shaped breakout Monday and up about 7% with less than ninety minutes on the clock. The outfit also happens to be a member of the IBD 50, so rest assured the company has leading fundamentals.

  

Not so good, according to intraday commentary at Investors.com, today's breakout is signaling from a third-stage base, which due to its high count, is less revered than a company with equal fundamentals but just clearing a first or second stage price pattern.

  

A bit more menacing from an option trading perspective is the ability to hedge shares comes with the immediate disadvantage of less-than-spectacular liquidity. Our eye-balled assessment is front month and February options suggest a standalone purchase or sale of a contract is possible, but maybe only in low doses.

  

Mostly puny open interest, very light activity and loosely quoted markets, are serious drawbacks which will impact both profitability and the ability to protect as efficiently.

  

A rather low float of just 26.3 million shares and 5.1% short interest according to Yahoo Finance appear to have worked their influence into put premiums which trade with a stiffer implied skew than the calls. This results in an outright call purchase being theoretically cheaper than buying the synthetic long call via a married put strategy.

  

But if you're a bull and before you rush out to buy the cheaper-looking call, do realize there is a potential stiff cost in not being able to short stock freely as an eventual hedge.

  

If shares of JAZZ have moved up sufficiently, a bull that's long a deep call can simply exercise the contract and proceed to sell shares to lock in a profit. But, if the contract still maintains time value or extrinsic premium relative to the current shares price, that money would be forfeited in the event the trader goes through with the exercise.

  

In saying that, given the fairly awful looking put markets, it's also not as though the married put is going to be all that blissful either for bulls looking for ways to manage risk more effectively than those often enough, slippery stops.

As an options trader, we're used to hearing colorful names associated with many of our thoughtful spreads; designed in anticipation of profits if we're correct on any number of Greek factors embedded in the position. One spread though that seems to have negative connotations attached to it is what's referred to as a "Stupid Spread." 

  

One such Stupid Spread went up in the **20-Year Treasury ETF**  ([TLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLT)) today. The label is due to the fact the trader bought February 118 puts and February 115 puts simultaneously. On the trading floor we'd refer to that type of position as a "Texas Hedge" as the person is increasing their delta exposure with both purchases. That said, today's Stupid Spread is less silly or aggressive in that the trader also ratio'ed long stock against the position.

  

  

Above, we're looking at a scaled down 10 lot of the position coupled with 790 shares of TLT. Our view is, it may look slightly skewed but instead of being stupid, what the trader has mostly constructed is a long strangle. The benefit of using this three way instead of a regular strangle might have to do with the ease of hedging or maybe even a requirement to own shares rather than long calls combined with long puts. 

  

Margin is certainly much greater on this type position than a regular strangle, so that's a negative consideration. And if left unadjusted and come expiration shares of TLT remain in the general vicinity, it will look silly if not unprofitable. However, put up 10,000 times as it was today, I don't think I can call this a stupid spread altogether.

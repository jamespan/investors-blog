Options trading for beginners can be a daunting task. Words like delta, volatility and premium scare many investors. For those looking to dip their toes into the options trading market, following a few easy steps will make the task a bit more manageable.




Options trading for beginners is most risky when someone enters the field without a plan. Many investors are wooed by the hope of high returns due to leverage — only to quickly realize that leverage works both ways. When someone buys an option for $2.00 per share, a 50-cent gain feels great, especially considering that it is a 25% return. It is important, however, to realize that leverage is a sword that's sharp on both sides. A 50-cent loss will also represent a 25% loss in the investment. What separates options trading professionals from novices is their ability to plan for and weather losses.


Make Decisions Based On Strike Price
------------------------------------


One of the biggest mistakes made in 0ptions trading is to make decisions on entries, stops and targets based on the options premium. A more effective way of making those decisions is to use contingent orders. These contingent orders are more like "if-then" statements. Take a look at the chart below as an example of what this type of order would be:


Entry: "If TLYS > $16.10 then buy Nov 15 Call option" — Breakout Entry


Stop: "If TLYS < $14.81 then sell Nov 15 Call option" — 8% stop loss


Target: "If TLYS > $19.32 then sell Nov 15 Call option" — 20% profit target



By using contingent orders, investors can capitalize on good stock trades without having to understand every part of the options-pricing model.


Keep It Simple
--------------


Options trading for beginners can quickly get overwhelming. Horizontal spreads, vertical spreads, multidirectional trades, and many other permutations of options can get very complicated. By simply buying calls and buying puts, options trading can be less daunting and make it a seamless transition.


If an investor believes a stock will rise, it might make sense just to buy a call. If an investor thinks that a stock will fall, it might make sense just to buy the put as a replacement to shorting the stock. Stock replacement is the easiest and most effective way for new investors looking to get into options trading to have the quickest effect. Simply buying the call or put that's closest to current price about 90 days away from the time of the trade is a quick rule of thumb for beginners.


Stay Out Of The News
--------------------


While news will often drive stock movement, 0ptions trading will be especially volatile around news events.


As a novice options trader, it is not imperative to know everything about the entire pricing model, but knowing the effect of volatility is helpful. The best way to describe volatility is like a balloon that can be inflated or deflated at will. The more news that is released, the more inflated the balloon typically will be. As an options trader it is important to not buy options that are overinflated, because selling after the news means that you may sell them once the air has come out of the balloon.

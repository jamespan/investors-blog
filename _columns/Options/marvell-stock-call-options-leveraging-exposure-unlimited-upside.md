**Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) stock recently pulled back to successfully test the all-important [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-why-the-10-week-moving-average-offers-new-entry-points/). 




Marvell stock is showing a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 92, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 77, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 90. 


Earnings are set for Thursday after the close, with the options market pricing in the potential for a 6.3% move. 


Investors who think MRVL stock is due to rally and don't want to risk significant capital can use long call options rather than buying the stock outright. 


A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (the strike price) up until a certain date (the expiration date). 


One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage. (This can be both a good and a bad thing.) 


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of Marvell stock, he or she would have to invest around $6,000 at the current price. 


Exposure With Fraction Of Capital On Marvell Stock
--------------------------------------------------


Instead, the investor could gain a similar exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option. 


One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares. 



If an investor were to buy one Marvell 62-strike call option expiring on Sept. 3, they would only need to invest around $125 (based on Friday quotes) rather than $6,000.


The break-even price for this call option is equal to the strike price plus the premium paid, which would make the break-even price 63.25. 


If Marvell stock stays below 62, the option trader loses the full $125. However, if MRVL stock shoots higher after earnings, the upside is unlimited. 


Using options in this way can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock without risking as much capital as would be required to buy the stock outright. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

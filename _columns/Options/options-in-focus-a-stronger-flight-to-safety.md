With just under an hour left in Thursday's session, the S&P 500 is taking a technical hammering deep below the prior session's hopeful hammer reversal candlestick. In sympathy, the CBOE Volatility Index or "VIX" is soaring to a near repeat and fearful test of its March highs. 

  

Risk aversion is also showing its popularity in products like the **iShares 20-Year**  ([TLT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TLT)) bond proxy, which is jumping by more than 3% to fresh year-to-date highs. A drilling of nearly 6% in the **US Oil Fund** ([USO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=USO)) to year-to-date lows and an intraday unraveling of what had been some precious metals ([SLV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SLV)), ([GLD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GLD)) of late adds a bit more color to a Street seeing red. 

  

Another confirmation of market conditions more than a bit out of control and likely overdone is the volume explosion in the **S&P500's ETF** ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)) options. More than 6.5 million contracts have traded thus far. That's only second to March's highs of just more than 7 million. That's well above its daily average of about 1.8 million and with time still on the clock, that ultra heavy volume driven by traders seeking net protection could be eclipsed. 

  

All told, conditions are ripe for a sharp reaction in the other direction. Whether or not this happens and how that might occur given Friday's premarket nonfarm payrolls data, is of course, part of today's investor folly. To that end, if you're going to participate in such a volatile gamble, make your odds of staying in the game approachable with options and strategies such as verticals, which reduce risk and increase one's chances for success. 

  

Of course there's no guarantee of profits. But in an environment which vastly increases one's risk beyond a traditional stop loss tied to a predetermined stock level; using options smartly boils down to real safety in the market which has nothing to do with fleeting investor flight and fancy.

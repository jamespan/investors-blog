**Draft Kings** ([DKNG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DKNG)) stock had an impressive gain on Tuesday, rising 7.3% and showing bullish option activity.




Option traders who think DKNG stock might retest the June high around 45, could look at an option strategy known as a bull call spread.


A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy. You can create it through buying a [call option](https://www.investors.com/research/options/what-is-a-call-option-options-trading/) and then selling a further out-of-the-money call. Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade. But it also limits the upside.


Going out to September expiration, a 40 strike [call option](https://www.investors.com/research/options/what-is-a-call-option-options-trading/) in Draft Kings stock recently traded around $2.15 per contract and a 45 call was around $1.00.


Buying the 40 call and selling the 45 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $115 and the maximum profit potential would be $385 (difference in strike prices less the premium paid).


Draft Kings Stock: Details On The Bull Call Spread
--------------------------------------------------



A bull call spread is a risk defined strategy, so if Draft Kings stock closes below 40 on Sept. 18, the most the trade could lose is the $115 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 45. So, no matter how high Draft Kings stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $385.


Trading this options spread can offer an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure.


Counting against the stock is its [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of only 68 and an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/eps-rating-is-key-to-picking-great-stocks/) of 52, so traders would need to weigh up the fundamentals as well as the technical.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

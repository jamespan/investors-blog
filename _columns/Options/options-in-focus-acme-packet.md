**Acme Packet** ([APT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=APT)), an IBD 50 constituent and network-to-network telecom gear and software outfit, shook off an intraday technical crack below its 50-day moving average support Monday in rebounding by about 4.5% and keeping losses contained to roughly half that amount.

  

While there appears to be an absence of news behind today's price action, shares had been in need of some technical backing and filling following a jump above its upper channel line. Last week Investors.com noted this type action often finds a stock ripe for profit-taking. As it now stands, shares of APKT have corrected 22% from recent highs.

  

With earnings slated for next Tuesday, the front month February contract saw its share of sympathetic but difficult to interpret trading. Volume jumped to nearly 18,000 contracts late in the session and more than seven times its daily average of about 2,500.

  

Puts have outpaced call activity by a margin of 1.65-to-1 with the February 50 contract receiving the most favor on volume in excess of 4,000. With shares near 52.25, the put is out-the-money by just more than 4%. However, due to ramping implieds now at 75% and their highest levels in more than three months, premium of $3 per contract is somewhat exorbitant for protection when using a straight up put purchase against long stock holdings or for strict naked long bearish speculating.

  

Unfortunately, for bears and those bulls seeking help from the option market, aside from being a bit late to the punch, APKT's markets while active aren't ideal for spreading. Realistically, an at-the-money vertical is about all that's possible without giving away too much theoretical edge and standing an actual chance at getting filled.

  

Given the circumstances of steep premiums, APKT's price run and its upcoming reportâ€”I'd say that's still a better place to start than simply "buy to open."

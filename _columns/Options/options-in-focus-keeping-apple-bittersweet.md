They tell us an apple a day keeps the doctor away. But in a market on the verge of some serious technical sickness, the market's second biggest company by market cap, **Apple**  ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) is quickly becoming a severe health issue for the broader averages. In Thursday's session and despite the likes of the S&P 500 managing to gain ground of nearly 0.90%, shares of AAPL finished lower by -2.5%. 

  

Most certain, there were headline drivers unnerving investors in a name that's never at a loss of media attention. The real panic though may have been technical in nature as three weeks of lateral technical work above the 50-day simple moving average, made a clean and heavier volume break of that key support. 

  

Secondly, as a name that has held up better than most stocks during the past couple months and run further from that memorable low in 2009, there's reason to appreciate that even if the market were to right itself back up technically, leadership from Apple could prove a memory. 

  

In order to maybe make that memory a bit more bittersweet, for bulls still standing by the market's version of Old Faithful, marrying shares to a put might be a smart move. Apple's listed options are routinely the most actively traded equity out there and maintain unrivaled liquidity for a stock having a triple digit price tag and some decent volatility to boot.

  

Bottom line, we'd actually prefer bulls to don a collar for just that sort of long-term commitment. In our mind, financing the put while having the ability to adjust the short call if needed, sound about right to this strategist, who's also an admittedly late adapter that just purchased his own dearly beloved and already behind-the-times iPhone4. As much, in feeling like we've purchased the top in a different sort of way, bulls in the stock may have another reason to contain their enthusiasm for Apple going forward.

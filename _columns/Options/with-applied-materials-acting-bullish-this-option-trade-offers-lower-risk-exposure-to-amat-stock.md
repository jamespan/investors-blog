**Applied Materials** ([AMAT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMAT)) was added to [SwingTrader](https://swingtrader.investors.com/) last week as a full position after the stock bounced from the 50-day moving average. The stock broke out of a base Monday, too. 




The stock topped the 159.10 buy point of a base on base formation. Volume was flat, which works against the breakout. Still, AMAT stock is in a buy range from the 50-day line. The buy zone goes from 155.41 to 159.30, and a profit could be taken around 170.


Let's take a look at how we can use options to find a favorable risk to reward trade on the assumption that Applied Materials will reach the profit zone. 


We will look at a bullish diagonal spread, which allows traders to go long on AMAT stock without risking too much capital. 


Bullish Diagonal Spread For Applied Materials Stock
---------------------------------------------------


A bullish diagonal spread is a trade that involves buying a long-term call option and selling a shorter-term, further out-of-the-money call option. 


Traders with a price target of 170 could place the bullish diagonal spread at that price. AMAT stock traded around 160 Monday morning.


Selling the February-expiration, 170-strike call option will generate around $400 in premium, and buying the March 160-strike call will cost around $930. 


That results in a net cost for the trade of $530 per spread, which is the most the trade can lose. 


The estimated maximum profit is around $750, but that can vary depending on changes in implied volatility. The maximum profit would occur if AMAT stock closes right at 170 on Feb. 18. 


The idea with the trade is that if Applied Materials trades up to around 170, the diagonal spread will increase, resulting in a net profit. 


Exposure To Applied Materials Stock Without Much Risk
-----------------------------------------------------


A bullish diagonal spread is a good way to gain some upside exposure on a stock without risking too much if the move doesn't eventuate. 


The combined position has a net delta of 18, which means the trade is roughly equivalent to owning 18 shares of AMAT stock, although this will change as the trade progresses. 


The suggested stop-loss level is a close below the Dec. 22 low of 148.92. 


Applied Materials is ranked No. 9 in its industry group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 91 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 92.

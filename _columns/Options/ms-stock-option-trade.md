**Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) has been trading within a narrow range for the last month or so. That could mean it's a good time to look at a long strangle trade for a potential breakout from the range.




A long strangle is constructed by buying an out-of-the-money call and an out-of-the-money put.


The trade aims to make a profit from a big move in either direction by the underlying stock.


Buying a long strangle is cheaper than a buying a long straddle, but will still suffer from time decay. That means the options will lose a little bit of value with each day that passes if the stock doesn't make a big move.


Time Factor In MS Stock Trade
-----------------------------


With a long strangle, the further out in time the trade is placed, the slower the time decay. But the options are more expensive and require more capital.



For MS stock, a long strangle could be placed by buying a 90 strike call and an 82.50 strike put for the June 21 expiration. The call was trading around $2.90 late Wednesday and the put around $3.15.


When we add the two together, the total cost of the trade would be around $6.05 per contract, or $605. This is the total amount of risk in the trade, and the maximum that could be lost.


The break-even prices are calculated by taking the strike price plus and minus the cost of the strangle.


That gives us break-even prices of 76.45 and 96.05. But profits can be made with a smaller move if the move comes earlier in the trade.


For example, the estimated break-even prices at the end of March are around 80 and 91.


Implied Volatility Could Affect MS Stock Trade
----------------------------------------------


Changes to implied volatility will have a big impact on this trade and the interim break-even prices. So it's important to have a solid understanding of volatility before placing a trade like this.


The ideal scenario is a large move in either direction within the first week or two of the trade.


The worst-case scenario with this MS stock long strangle would be a stable stock price, which would see both the call and put slowly lose value each day. For a long strangle, I usually set a stop loss at around 20% of capital at risk, which would be around $120. The profit target is around 40%.


I also wouldn't hold the trade any longer than March 31.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-morgan-stanley-ms.aspx), MS stock is ranked No. 13 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 62, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 46 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 48.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

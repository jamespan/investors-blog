IBD 50 constituent and dietary products marketer **Herbalife** ([HLF](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HLF)) put together a sizable serving of food for thought with regards to protecting one's portfolio of stocks with something other than a stop loss order. Shares of HLF plummeted by more than 20% intraday. In our estimation, the action quickly moved the stock off the radars of growth traders in action punctuated by price gaps and a couple trading halts. 

  

Behind Herbalife's bout of technical indigestion, famed short-seller David Einhorn raised some self-promoting questions to management on conference call regarding its distributor disclosure or lack thereof and a point of possible contention due to past problems regarding its network pipeline.

  

The action unsurprisingly didn't go unnoticed by option traders whom sent implieds throttling higher, back towards one-year highs and well above underlying statistical movement. At-the-money IV / SV ratios soared higher and are now fetching 2.5 — 3.5 compared to fair value readings of 1.00. The strong bid is also in stark contrast to typical post earnings action, which had been setting up for a decent volatility crush of already well-bid implieds going into the earnings announcement. 

  

Most active in over-the-top trading unworthy of "print surfing"; when all was said and done, the surrounding money May 50 put and May 60 call put together similar volume of 7,400 and 7,200 with both contracts dwarfing the existing open interest. 

  

By crowd proxy and given the large uptick in implieds, a long strangle constructed of the May 50 / 60 contracts closed for $3.25 per spread mid-market with HLF shares mostly centered at 56.25. With breakevens of 46.75 and 63.25 and expiration just 16 days out on the calendar, there's some fat in those contracts to be sure. However, as with cholesterol, there's good fat and bad fat to consider when taking a bite in this type of highly stressed situation—and one where some type of protective strategy looks wholly in order.

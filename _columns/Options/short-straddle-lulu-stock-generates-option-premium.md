When a stock gives an impressive run, you expect it to take a pause. While you might not make money on the stock trade, a short straddle option trade could benefit from the sideways action. Here's a look at how to set it up for LULU stock.




**Lululemon Athletica** ([LULU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LULU)) experienced an impressive rally from the March low around 130 to a recent high near 325.



That's an impressive rally any way you look at it. Perhaps now, LULU stock is due to consolidate those gains for a few weeks.


When option traders form an opinion that a stock is going to trade sideways, they might look to sell a short straddle.


Short Straddle For LULU Stock
-----------------------------


This option trading strategy involves selling an at-the-money put and an at-the-money call with the same strike price with the same expiration date.


This trade generates a large amount of premium for the option seller, but it does come with risks. A short straddle is an unprotected trade, sometimes referred to as a "naked" trade. Naked options can be risky as they expose the trader to potentially unlimited losses if the stock makes a big move.


However, if the trader is right and the stock trades sideways, large gains are also possible.


Assuming a trader believes that LULU stock will trade sideways over the next few weeks, they could look to sell a 290 put and a 290 call with a July 17 expiration for both.


On Friday, the July 290 put could be sold for around 11.55 and the 290 call could be sold for around 10.85.

Short Straddle Risks And Rewards
--------------------------------


Selling those two options brings in a total of $2,240 in premium. That is the maximum possible gain on the trade. A close right at 290 for LULU stock on the day of expiration achieves it.


Where does the trade break even? Take the strike price of 290 plus and minus the total premium received of 22.40.Â If the stock price is below 267.60 or above 312.40 at expiration, the trade suffers losses. The payoff graph shows you where your window of profit is and how the losses get larger the more the stock moves in either direction.

This option trade on LULU stock is a short vega trade. That means if implied volatility increases early in the trade, losses could also occur. At the moment, implied volatility on LULU stock is around 43%. That's slightly above average for the last 12 months.


Short straddles are an advanced option strategy. If all that sounds confusing, it's best not to trade them. Maybe watch a couple from the sidelines. Seeing it play out in real time helps you understand how the option trade moves with the stock price.


With a trade like this the potential losses are unlimited and a lot higher than the potential gains. Traders need a high confidence level that the stock is going to remain flat over the course of the trade.

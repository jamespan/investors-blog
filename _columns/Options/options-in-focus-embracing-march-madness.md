As investors steer positions into the final couple days of what's been a very strong quarter and an optimistically expressive game of March Madness for bulls, it seems a great time to protect ones portfolio beyond the simple stop loss and look to the option market for help. 

  

With the CBOE Volatility Index or the less-euphemistically called Fear Index in a less-than-mad and quite confident position near 15% these past two weeks, premiums in the market are by and large quite affordable. Furthermore, aside from calls and puts testing multi-year lows in many products, the percentage run in many of those same underlying instruments has allowed for possibly outsized gains in a short period of time for many bulls riding long stock positions. Net, net protection for portfolios is on sale these days. 

  

Of course, not every winner during this winning streak is going to match up to a performance like IBD 50 constituent and market heavyweight **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)). Many names are also very unlikely to afford the same liquidity measures provided by Apple's very heavily-traded call and put markets. Nonetheless, using various strategies such as the simple married put or a stock substitute long call position; looking certainly can't hurt and more likely than not, it's the type of defensive play that keeps a bull looking smart long after the game has turned.

  

  

Shown above and to illustrate a bit of this defensive style positioning before its maybe deemed wholly necessary and possibly out of reach is a one lot collar in Apple. Assuming a purchase of 100 shares at $515 during February and a return of about 19.5% or about $1,000 with AAPL near 614.5 intraday, this long shareholder could establish a risk reversal by selling the April 625 call and purchasing the 605 protective put for a small debit of $1.20. 

  

The net effect as many traders familiar with options might guess, is a very nice-looking collar. This particular collar maintains a guaranteed stop at 605 plus the small debit to yield a guaranteed near $8,900 profit on the downside, however unlikely folks might see that as being a reality. On the upside, another $900 is not only possible, but the profit cap in place might be lifted under the right set of circumstances to allow for even larger gains. Net, net our hope is this type of play should have traders saying "iWant1-2!" instead of "iPad3!" as the latest and greatest thing.

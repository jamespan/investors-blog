Following last week's late two day fight in the SP-500 to reclaim the 50-day simple moving average with a bullish hammer confirmation; bulls opted for a flight to safety with inflation and fear of weakening global growth the new hand being played.

  

As Monday's action might be a brand new start to a more bearish game for the broader market, option traders may want to look at **F5 Networks** ([FFIV](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FFIV)) for positioning within an existing downtrend.

  

The erstwhile growth stock has been consolidating laterally for the last month below prior bullish gap support dating back to late October of last year. Further, the persistent price weakness of shares since scoring all-time-highs three months ago has just produced a bearish "Death Cross" of the 50 and 200 day simple moving averages.

  

One point strikes aren't available and FFIV doesn't trade in penny increments but the name does maintain Weekly options and also enjoys fairly strong liquidity characteristics for a volatile stock. With bid / ask spreads of $0.10 to $0.20 in most of its calls and puts through June expiration; there's plenty of option combinations which also have a reasonable chance of getting executed at or close to fair value.

  

Checking the option board for ideas given what's been described, I like the look of the May 90 / 80 bear put spread. The spread is fully out-of-the-money but priced for $3.10, a break of a couple percent below its current lateral support could yield an attractive opportunity to adjust or simply take profits.

  

In conjunction with an exit strategy to reduce the debit to a hopefully, smaller managed loss of $1.50 in the event shares rally above recent highs of $97.73; I like the idea "Buy, Sell and Hold" all the more in a sometimes very mad money market.

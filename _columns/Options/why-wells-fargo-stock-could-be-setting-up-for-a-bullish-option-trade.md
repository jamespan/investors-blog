Wells Fargo stock had an impressive bounce Tuesday and could be setting up well for a bullish option trade.




**Wells Fargo** ([WFC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=WFC)) jumped  6.6% Tuesday in higher volume. The 50-day moving average has flattened out and could turn higher if the stock can back up Tuesday's rally.


Counting against Wells Fargo stock is a very low [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 3, of a best-possible 99. A [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 6 is also low, so this would definitely be a contrarian play.


The great thing about options is that you can take directional exposure without risking too much capital.


One way to do that is with a bullish option trade known as a bull call spread.


Wells Fargo Stock: Bull Call Spread
-----------------------------------


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy created through buying a call and then selling a further out-of-the-money call.


Selling the further out-of-the-money call reduces the cost of the trade but also limits the upside.



Going out to October expiration, a 30 strike call option was trading Tuesday around $0.95 and a 35 call was around $0.31.


Buying the 30 call and selling the 35 call would create a bull call spread. The cost of the trade would be $64 and the maximum profit potential would be $436 (difference in strike prices less the premium paid).


Defined Risk Strategy
---------------------


A bull call spread is a risk-defined strategy. That means if Wells Fargo closes below 30 on October 16, the most the trade could lose is the roughly $64 premium paid.


Potential gains are also capped above 35, so no matter how high Wells Fargo stock might go, the most the trade could profit is $436.


Trading a bull call spread can be an easier way for smaller traders to gain a bullish exposure to Wells Fargo stock using options.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.


However, a well executed bull call spread can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock or ETF.

**The Trade Desk**  ([TTD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TTD)) is showing elevated implied volatility with an IV Percentile of 54%. That said, options traders may want to look at an iron condor play in Trade Desk stock.




The IV figure in TTD means that the current level of implied volatility is higher than 54% of all other readings in the past 12 months.


Why is that? In part, the company is due to report earnings after the closing bell Wednesday. Naturally, we tend to see elevated implied volatility around that event.


Trade Desk stock has stayed within the expected range following three of the last six earnings announcements. 


In fact, for this upcoming earnings report, TTD stock is anticipated to stay in a 13.3% range up or down.


Trade Desk Stock Today
----------------------



Therefore, traders who think Trade Desk stock will not move too much following this Q1 report could look at an iron condor trade. As a reminder, this complex trade combines a bull put spread and a bear call spread. The idea with the trade? Profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction.


First, we take the bull put spread. Using the May 12 expiry, we could sell the 55 put and buy the 50 put. That spread recently sold for around $0.70. Then design the bear call spread. Place it by selling the 75 call and buying the 80 call. This spread could have generated around $0.55 in premium received.


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1.25 per contract or $125 of premium that goes into the trader's pocket for a block of 100 shares.

The Profit Zone
---------------


For this trade in Trade Desk stock, the profit zone ranges between 53.75 and 76.25. This can be calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received.


As both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 — 1.25 x 100 = $375.


Therefore, if we take the premium ($125) divided by the maximum risk ($375), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 33%.


If price action stabilizes, then iron condors work well. However, if TTD makes a bigger than expected move, the trade will suffer a loss. Trades held over earnings allow little room for adjusting, so they can be a bit hit-or-miss.

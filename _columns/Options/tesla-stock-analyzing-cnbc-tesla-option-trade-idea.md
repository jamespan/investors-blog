Last week on CNBC's "Options Action," Carter Worth shared his opinion that Tesla stock may trade sideways or lower over the coming weeks.




Mike Khouw then suggested a trade called a bear call spread.


A bear call spread involves selling an out-of-the-money call and buying a further out-of-the-money call.


The strategy can be profitable if the stock trades lower, sideways and even if it trades slightly higher, as long as it stays below the short call at expiration.


Khouw's idea involved selling a September-expiring 2,250 call and buying the 2,300 call for around $13.50.


The maximum profit on the trade would be $1,350 per contract with a maximum risk of $3,650.

CLOSE




The spread would achieve the maximum profit if Tesla stock closes below 2,250 on Sept. 18, in which case the entire spread would expire worthless, allowing the premium seller to keep the $1,350 option premium.


The maximum loss would occur if Tesla stock closes above 2,300 on Sept. 18, which would see the premium seller lose $3,650 on the trade.



It's a brave trade betting against a stock like **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)), so it will be interesting to see how this one performs. Previously we've looked at doing the opposite and selling bull put spreads.


Tesla Stock Split
-----------------


Another thing to keep in mind is the Tesla stock split scheduled for Aug. 31. This will result in option strike prices being adjusted in line with the stock split.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

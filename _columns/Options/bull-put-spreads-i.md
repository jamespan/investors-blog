This is the first of three articles focused on bull put spreads, a type of vertical options spreads. Vertical spreads are an intermediate-level options strategy with a wide variety of uses. Traders who use vertical spreads must first understand the strategy mechanics, i.e., what happens at expiration. Second, it is necessary to understand the nuances of the price behavior of vertical spreads prior to expiration, and, third, a two-step plan for trading a vertical spread is an important part of using vertical spreads successfully.

  

**Introduction**

  

A "Bull Put Spread" is perfectly suited for investors who seek to buy stock below the current market price and limit risk at the same time. It is also a popular option strategy used to generate consistent monthly income. This article will explain what bull put spreads are and what might happen at option expiration.  A traditional profit and loss diagram will be used to analyze the potential profit and potential risk. Next week, an example that shows how a conservative investor might use a bull put spread will be presented. Subsequently, in two weeks, a trading-oriented use of bull put spreads that targets monthly income will be discussed.

  

The discussions in this article do not include commissions, other transaction costs or margin requirements. Since vertical spreads in general, and bull put spreads in particular, involve two option positions, transaction costs can be higher than for single option trades. These factors can significantly impact the desirability of bull put spreads, and they must be included in the analysis of any real strategy involving real options.

  

**Bull Put Spread Defined**

  

The sale of one put and simultaneous purchase of a second put with the same underlying and same expiration but with a *lower strike price* is known as a bull put spread. Graph 1 illustrates a Bull Put Spread in which one XYZ 90 Put is sold for 8.00, and one XYZ 80 Put is purchased for 3.50.

  

The name *Bull Put Spread* describes three aspects of the position. First, this is a *bull* put spread, because the position has a tendency to profit as the underlying stock price rises. Second, this is a bull *put* spread, because only put options are involved. Third, this is a bull put *spread*, because two different options are involved. The term spread is used loosely to describe a wide range of multiple-option positions, but, in this example, it refers to the 10-point difference, or spread, between the strike prices of the 80 and 90 Puts. 

  

Outcome 1: Stock price below the lower strike price. In this outcome, the short put is assigned (stock is purchased at the upper strike) and the long put is exercised (stock is sold at the lower strike). Result: no stock position and the maximum loss is incurred.

  

Outcome 2: Stock price between the strikes: In this outcome, the short put is assigned (stock is purchased at the upper strike price) and the long put expires worthless. Result: a long stock position is established.

  

Outcome 3: The stock price is above the upper strike. In this outcome both puts expire worthless. Result: no stock position and the net premium is kept as income, which is the maximum possible profit.

  

**Common Terminology**

  

It is common practice to describe a vertical spread using the lower strike first, regardless of whether calls or puts are involved, and regardless of which option is sold. Hence the name for the position in Graph 1 is an 80-90 Bull Put Spread.

  

Bull put spreads are sometimes referred to as "short put spreads" or "credit put spreads," because they are established for a net receipt, or net credit. The spread in Graph 1, for example, is established by selling the 90 Put for 8, or $800, and simultaneously purchasing the 80 Put at 3.50, or $350. The result is a net receipt, or net credit, of 4.50, or $450, not including commissions.

  

**Profit/Loss at Expiration**

  

At expiration, there are three possible outcomes. The underlying stock can be at or above the higher strike, below the higher strike but not below the lower strike, and below the lower strike. The straight line in Graph 1 illustrates these possibilities. If the stock price is at or above the upper strike at expiration (Outcome 3), then both puts expire worthless, and the full amount received, $450 less transaction costs in this example, is kept as income. This is the maximum possible profit.

  

If the stock price is below the higher strike but not below the lower strike (Outcome 2), then the short put (higher strike) is assigned, and the long put (lower strike) expires worthless. Assignment of a short put means that the underlying stock is purchased. Consequently, this outcome results in a long stock position at an effective price of 85.50. This price is calculated by subtracting the net premium received (4.50) from the strike price of the assigned put (90).

  

If the stock price is below the lower strike at expiration (Outcome 1), then the short put is assigned (stock is purchased at $90 in this example), and the long put is exercised (stock is sold at $80). The result is the maximum possible loss. Specifically, a net cash payment is made that equals the difference between the strikes, which is 10 per share, or $1,000, in this example. The credit received, $450 in this example, is subtracted from the $1,000 paid, and the result is the net loss of 5.50, or $550 not including commissions. 5.50, which is the difference between the strikes less the net credit originally received, is the maximum loss that can be incurred with a bull put spread.

  

**Risk of Early Assignment**

  

Positions involving short stock options in the U.S. involve the risk of early assignment. This means that the writer of a put option might be required to purchase the underlying stock at any time that a short put position is open.  Since one component of a bull put spread is a short put, investors and traders who use this strategy must have a contingency plan for an early assignment. If sufficient excess cash (or excess marginable securities) is available, then the stock can be purchased without fear of a margin call. However, if a bull put spread is established without the ability to purchase the underlying stock, then early assignment of the short put might result in a margin call. This could trigger the sale of the stock by the broker if the required additional capital is not deposited by the deadline.

  

**Summary**

  

A bull put spread is a strategy that brings in option premium and limits risk at the same time. A margin deposit and prior approval from a brokerage firm are required.  If the stock price at expiration is above the higher strike price, then the net premium is kept as income. This is the maximum potential profit of the strategy.  If the stock price is between the strikes at expiration, then a long stock position is established. Finally, if the stock price is below the lower strike price at expiration, then the maximum loss potential is realized. Next week:  "Bull Put Spreads 2:  Uses for Conservative Investors."

The S&P 500 failed right at the [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/50-day-moving-average-identifies-buy-sell-signals/) Tuesday and that could mean it's a good time to add some bearish option trades.




**Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) was down nearly 2% Tuesday and closed near the low of the day. So it could provide a bearish trade.


Apple stock is down 11% year to date and could undercut the 52-week low of 164.07.


If the stock continues to move lower, a bear put spread would be the best way to trade it. A bear put spread is a debit spread. That means we need to pay the premium to open the trade.


On Apple stock, a bear put spread could be set up using the 160 strike as the long put and the 155 strike as the short put for the July 19 expiration.


Potential Gain Of $365 On Apple Stock
-------------------------------------


This trade would cost around $135 per contract with a maximum potential gain of $365.



To achieve the maximum profit, this trade would need Apple stock to drop a further 9% between now and expiration on July 19.


The break-even point for the bear put spread is 158.65. That's calculated as 160 less the $1.35 option premium per contract.


If Apple stock drops early in the trade it may be possible to make a profit at slightly higher prices.


At expiration, if Apple stock is trading above 160, the entire spread would expire worthless. The trade would lose 100%, or $135.


Exit Strategy For Apple Stock Trade
-----------------------------------


For a trade like this, I wouldn't bother with a stop loss. Either the trade works or it doesn't, so I would trade an appropriate position size in case I suffered the full 100% loss. Alternatively, you could set a stop loss at 50% of the premium paid.


Because this is a bearish position, traders that think Apple stock could move higher from here should not enter this trade.


According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Apple stock is ranked No. 3 in its industry group. It has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 61, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 94 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 26.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

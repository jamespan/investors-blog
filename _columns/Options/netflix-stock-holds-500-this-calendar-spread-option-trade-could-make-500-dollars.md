A calendar spread is an income trade that involves selling a short-term option and buying a longer-term option with the same strike price. You can even perform this trade in a megacap growth stock such as **Netflix** ([NFLX](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NFLX)).




Usually, this is done with monthly options. But options traders can also make this trade with weekly options. Traders typically use call options unless the trade has a bearish bias, in which case they would use puts.


Netflix Stock: Setting Up The Calendar Spread
---------------------------------------------


With Netflix stock trading around 510, setting up a calendar spread at 510 gives the trade a neutral outlook.


Selling a single Aug. 20-expiration call option with a strike price of 510 will generate around $1,045 in premium, and buying one Aug. 27-expiring 510 call will cost roughly $1,230. That results in a net cost for the trade of $185 per spread, and that is the most the trade can lose.



The estimated maximum profit is $500, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if Netflix remains around 510 for the next few weeks, the sold option will decay faster than the bought option, allowing the trade to be closed for a profit.


When To Exit
------------


The break-even prices for the trade are estimated at around 495 and 525, but these can also change slightly depending on changes in implied volatility.


For this reason, calendar spreads are considered a more advanced strategy and not recommended for beginners.



For a trade like this, I would set a profit target of 30%, and I would set a stop loss if Netflix stock breaks through either 490 or 530.


Calendar spreads are a neutral options trading strategy. Bullish traders in this stock might consider something simpler like a bull put spread, similar to [this trade](https://www.investors.com/research/options/sq-stock-option-trade-offers-a-108-return-in-just-a-few-weeks/) in **Square** ([SQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SQ)) or this [cash secured put](https://www.investors.com/research/options/foot-locker-stock-how-to-use-cash-secured-put-option/) on **Cloudflare** ([NET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NET)).


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

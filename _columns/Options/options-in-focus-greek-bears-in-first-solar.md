One-time growth star **First Solar** ([FSLR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=FSLR)) sizzled higher on Friday by 8.5%. The bid follows a report of House Republicans passing a bill to phase out federal loan guarantees. If the bill passes, it could assist the solar leader's position within the beleaguered solar energy space as competition from would-be startups, would likely ease. 

  

The stock action didn't go unnoticed by option traders as heavy volume of nearly 57,000 changed hands Friday. At the same time though, call and put activity was very evenly matched. Simplistically, this might suggest an equal amount of bulls and bears involved. However, it's important to remember other key variables if we're going to see the whole picture. 

  

For starters and worth considering, much like with stock, there are two sides to every trade. Also but unlike stock there are buyers and sellers of two types of contracts. That means at the most basic level there are four types of bets to position with, namely long calls and long puts, as well as short calls and short puts.

  

  

Taking this train of thought a step further and packaging those individual bets into spreads against one another and appreciating all the calls and puts with which to tailor a position; it should be quickly realized that we're looking at potential positions which can go well beyond the classic bull / bear definition of investing. 

  

And if you don't yet understand theta, gamma, vega or rho like you do delta (directional risk); it's going to be very Greek and a bit confusing at first. The unlabeled risk graph shown above might confirm that, but in our estimation it's certainly a language worth learning.

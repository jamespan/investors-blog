**Zim Integrated Shipping Services** ([ZIM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ZIM)) is sitting at No. 11 in [the IBD 50](https://leaderboard.investors.com//#/ibd50/full) and is showing impressive relative strength in a tough market.




According to the [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/), Zim stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 97, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 80 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 98. It is forming a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/).


Investors who think Zim stock will stay above 65 for the next few months, could look at an August bull put spread. 


To execute a bull put spread, an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Selling the Aug. 19 put with a strike price of 65 and buying the 60 put would create a bull put spread.


This spread was trading on Friday for around $2. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $200 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $300.


Return Potential Of 67%
-----------------------


That represents a 67% return on risk between now and Aug. 19 if Zim stock remains above 65.


If Zim stock closes below 60 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $300.



The break-even point for the bull put spread is 63, which is calculated as 65 less the $2 option premium per contract.


This bull put spread trade has a delta of 10. That means it is a similar exposure to owning 10 shares of Zim stock, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.


In terms of a stop loss, if the stock dropped below 62, I would consider closing early for a loss.


With earnings due in mid-August, this trade could have earnings risk if held to expiry.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

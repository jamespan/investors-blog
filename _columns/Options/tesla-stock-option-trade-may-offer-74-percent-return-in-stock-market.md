Tesla stock is all the rage right now with governments around the world hastening the move to electric vehicles. **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) once again smashed through the 1,000 level yesterday with a 7% gain.




The pioneer in stylish, high-performance electric vehicles is ranked number one in its group, the automakers, with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 98 and a Relative Strength Rating of 99. The [RS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) shows how a stock is faring against all other companies in the IBD database on a 12-month price-performance basis.


Investors simply love the stock and anyone wanting to use options to take a bullish exposure on Tesla stock could do so via a bull put spread.


We've looked at this strategy a few times in recent weeks with this [GOOGL trade](https://www.investors.com/research/options/google-stock-and-bull-put-spread-bullish-options-trade/), [this trade on TWLO stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/twilio-stock-consider-bullish-option-trade-in-twilio-stock/) and [this trade on Microsoft stock](https://www.investors.com/research/options/microsoft-stock-offers-huge-return-for-high-risk-option-traders/).


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


Tesla Stock: Details On This Bullish Option Trade
-------------------------------------------------


Traders who think Tesla stock will remain above 1,000 could look to sell an Aug. 21-expiring 1,000 monthly put and buy a 990 put.


As of yesterday, this spread was trading for around $4.25 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $425 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $575.

That represents a 73.91% return on risk between now and Aug. 21 as long as Tesla stock remains above 1,000.


If Tesla stock closes below 990 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $575.


Tesla News
----------



Tesla is due to release Q2 earnings numbers on July 29 and the stock does have a history of making huge moves soon after. Keep an eye on IBD's [Earnings Calendar](https://www.investors.com/research/earnings-calendar-analyst-estimates-stocks-to-watch/), as well as the call options-focused [Earnings Preview column](https://www.investors.com/category/research/earnings-preview/).


This is where an options spread has an advantage over uncovered strategies. With a bull put spread, you always know the worst-case scenario — even if Tesla stock tanks.


It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

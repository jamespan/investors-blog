Are you waiting for a pullback to the initial breakout buy point, or are you buying now out of fear of missing a continuing rally? Would you like to get the best of both worlds? An options strategy known as the bullish collar creates an obligation to buy if prices dip and also lets you participate if prices rally. This article will first explain the bullish collar and then review an example using a recently featured stock in IBD.

  

**Bullish Collar Defined**

  

A bullish collar is created by simultaneously buying an out-of-the-money call and selling an out-of-the-money put. The short put represents an obligation to buy stock, and the long call contains the right to buy stock. The short put portion of the strategy requires a margin deposit.

  

**Example**

  

Consider a conservative investor who is debating what to do about XYZ stock which is currently trading at $50. The investor missed a buying opportunity when XYZ broke out above $40 a few months ago and has watched XYZ trade between $45 and $55 since then. The investor's target purchase price is now $45. He is worried, however, that XYZ might rally instead of dip, and he does not want to miss out if the price rises unexpectedly. The bullish collar might be just what this investor wants.

  

If the six-month August XYZ 45 Puts and 55 Calls are trading for $2.25 and $3.50, respectively, then the investor can sell 1 put and buy 1 call for each 100 shares that he desires to buy. The short 45-strike put is an obligation to buy 100 shares of XYZ at $45 per share, and the long 55-strike call is the right to buy 100 shares at $55. The net cost of the strategy is $125 in this example, not including commissions {(3.50 — 2.25) x $100 = $125)}.

  

**Possible Scenarios**

  

If the price of XYZ is below $45 at August expiration, then the short puts will be assigned and 100 shares of XYZ stock will be purchased for each put sold. The total cost of the stock in this case is $46.25 per share. This price is calculated by adding the strike price of the puts ($45.00) and the per-share cost of the option strategy ($1.25 per share).

  

If the price of XYZ is at or between $45 and $55, the strike prices, then both options expire worthless, and the $125 cost of the strategy plus commissions is lost.

  

If the price of XYZ is above $55 at expiration, then the 55 Calls can be exercised and shares of XYZ stock can be purchased. In this case, the approximate total cost of the stock is $56.25 per share. This is calculated by adding the strike price of the calls ($55.00) and the per-share cost of the option strategy ($1.25 per share). If the price of XYZ stock is above $55 at expiration, then the investor's forecast of price decline was not realized. The purchase of XYZ at $56.25 can be viewed as a consolation prize — at least the stock was purchased during the rally.

  

**Current Example — CTSH**

  

**Cognizant Technology** ([CTSH](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CTSH)) was listed as a leader in up volume in the Market Pulse in [The Big Picture column from Friday, February 8](http://news.investors.com/investing-the-big-picture/020713-643667-stocks-counterpunch-trimming-days-losses.htm), after having rallied over $3.00 from the previous day. CTSH at 78.73 is slightly above its high of 78.00 last March and could be poised for a continued upward surge. On the other hand, it could also experience a normal pull back of 10-15%. The chart of CTSH appears to have strong support near 70.00.

  

If you are willing to buy CSTH at 70.00 but still want participation if the rally continues, then the options market gives you an opportunity to commit to buying the stock near $70.00 and, at the same time, be able to participate if the stock's strong rally continues.

  

With CTSH trading at 78.73 at the close on Friday, February 8, the CTSH July 70 Put had a bid price of 2.05 per share, and the July 85 Call was offered at 2.55. Simultaneously buying the call and selling this put at these prices has a net cost of 50 cents per share, not including commissions.

  

The maxim possible risk is the same as buying CTSH at $70.50, the strike price of the put plus the net cost of the strategy. If, however, the stock rallies, then the 85-strike call participates dollar for dollar above $85 at option expiration in July. If the stock fluctuates in a range and closes between $70 and $85 at July expiration, then both options expire worthless; and the 50 cents per share for the strategy is lost.

  

**Summary**

  

A bullish collar is created by simultaneously buying out-of-the-money calls and selling out-of-the-money puts. Short puts require a margin deposit. If the stock price at expiration is below the lower strike price, then the puts are assigned, and stock is purchased. If the stock price is at or between the strikes at expiration, then the options expire and the net cost of the strategy is lost. If the stock price is above the higher strike price, then the calls participate in the rally.

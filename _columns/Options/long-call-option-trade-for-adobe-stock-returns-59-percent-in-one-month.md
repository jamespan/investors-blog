Back in early May, **Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) stock was in buy range from a [cup-with-handle breakout](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). At the time, this column looked at buying a call option rather than buying Adobe stock. Here's how it played out.




Long Call Option Trades
-----------------------


As a reminder, a call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (called the strike price), up until a certain date (expiration date).


A call option provides leverage. It allows a trader to profit in the upside move of a stock for a fraction of the cost.


Of course, leverage can be a double-edged sword. It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment. In this case, the Adobe stock example is working beautifully.


Option On Adobe Stock Revisited
-------------------------------



On May 5, Adobe stock was trading at around 350 after breaking out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). It was one of the [5 Best Stocks To Buy And Watch Now](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now/) as well as one of the "Leaders Near A Buy Point" on [IBD's Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard) product.


Rather than purchase Adobe stock, we looked at buying a January 2021 call option with a strike price of 300. At the time, that call was trading for around $7,610 per contract.


The stock market had a strong May, but even so, Adobe stock outperformed. Its recent earnings report pushed it to new high territory above 400. That call option idea exploded in value rising to $12,130. The gain of around $4,520 is a 59.4% return on the capital invested in just over a month's time.


Plus, there is still roughly six months until expiration, so there's potential for an even greater gain.


Adobe Stock Versus The Option Trade
-----------------------------------


Compare that to a stock investor owning 100 shares of Adobe stock bought at the same time around 350. Their investment value increased from $35,000 to $40,654.


The dollar gain is slightly higher at $5,654, but the percentage return is much lower at just 16.2%. That's not bad for a stock in just a month, but it pales in comparison to the option. The option gave you most of the upside participation for a fraction of the cost.

It's not hard to see why options have become more popular. The higher returns over stocks can be very enticing.


Of course, not all trades work like Adobe stock did. But remember to check this column each day for new ideas and analysis.

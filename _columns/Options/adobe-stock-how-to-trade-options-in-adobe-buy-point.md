**Adobe** ([ADBE](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ADBE)) is currently one of the strongest stocks in the S&P 500 and sits on [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint) among "Leaders Near A Buy Point."


With a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) and EPS Rating both 99, on a 1-99 scale with 99 tops, and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 91, ADBE stock is poised to benefit should the market continue to stabilize and even push higher.




ADBE recently reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of $2.33 per share on revenue of $3.1 billion. The consensus earnings estimate was $2.21 per share on revenue of $3 billion. The company said it expects fiscal second-quarter earnings (for the May-ending quarter) of approximately $2.35 per share on revenue of about $3.175 billion.


Adobe stock appears as one of the [5 Best Stocks To Buy And Watch Now](https://www.investors.com/research/best-stocks-to-buy-now/). It also holds a position in [IBD Leaderboard](https://www.investors.com/product/leaderboard/?artProdLink=Leaderboard).


One strategy to take advantage of rising stocks is a long call option. A call option is a contract between a buyer and seller. The contract gives the buyer the right to purchase a certain stock at a certain price (called the strike price), up until a certain date (expiration date). One of the benefits of call options is that they provide leverage; this can be both a good and a bad thing.


Adobe Stock: Going Long With Less Money
---------------------------------------


Assuming an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of ADBE at 350, they would have to invest around $35,000 at the current price. Instead, the investor could gain the same exposure using a fraction of the capital by buying a call option.


One call option gives the investor exposure to 100 shares.

If the investor were to buy one ADBE $300 call option expiring in January 2021, they would only need to invest $7,610 rather than $35,000. If ADBE goes to $0, the investor loses only $7,610 while still maintaining a similar exposure to the gains.


The ADBE $300 call option gives the investor the right to buy 100 ADBE common shares at $300 up until the expiration date.


The call option costs around $76.10 so the investor would need Adobe stock to rise above 376.10 (strike price plus premium paid) in order to be profitable on the investment.


More On How To Trade Calls
--------------------------


There is always a risk with trading on leverage like this; if Adobe stock drops below 300 at expiry, the investor would lose 100% of the investment, which is the $7,610. If an investor is holding 100 shares on the other hand, and it drops 50 points from its 350 price, they would lose around $5,000, and possibly more if shares keep falling below 300.


Buying a call option is just one of numerous possible option strategies, but it is a very easy one for investors to get started with. It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment. However, a long call option when done correctly can be a great way to gain exposure to a stock or ETF with the same upside potential and less downside risk.


Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

Is a near 4% correction in the S&P 500 enough for bulls to hang their hats on? Seasonal weakness states otherwise historically. A period known as the "Worst Six Months" is just underway and follows a very strong near 30% run during the "Best Six Months. That's not to mention a double from those devilish lows of 666 in the S&P500 from the March 2009 bottom and also the market's current corrective status. 

  

Nonetheless, with the broader market finishing virtually unchanged after managing a hammer reversal pattern back through an intraday break of 50-day simple moving average support, the 4% correction may look a bit more attractive than otherwise to some bulls looking to make a faster money play off potential support. 

  

One crafty way option traders may look to feed both a shorter-term bullish bias and longer-term bearish view is by legging into a synthetic long put in an instrument such as the **S&P 500 ETF**  ([SPY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SPY)). This strategy which would have the trader purchasing a call to start then proceed to short shares on a one-for-one basis after a rally in the market. 

  

There are no guarantees of course of market prices obliging our view. In fact, the possibility of buying a call and watching it decline in value if the market opts to go lower has to be accepted as a very real risk. Nonetheless, for those that like their position risk well defined and with premiums for calls (and puts) still relatively cheap, the trade makes a bit more "cents" and sense than otherwise.

Bitcoin continued its ascent on Wednesday a day after derivatives marketplace giant **CME Group** ([CME](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CME)) said it would launch bitcoin futures by year-end.









 
 
 The cryptocurrency was up 1.5% at to $6543.06 on Wednesday evening after spiking 5.5% on Tuesday. While [bitcoin has surged](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/before-buy-bitcoin-know-cryptocurrency-investment-risks/) in value this year, its rise has frequently been tripped up by remarks from skeptics — among them **JPMorgan Chase** ([JPM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=JPM)) CEO Jamie Dimon, who has called it a "fraud" — who believe bitcoin's failure is inevitable.
The bitcoin futures contract will be cash-settled, CME said in a Tuesday release. CME CEO Terry Duffy said the decision to launch a bitcoin futures contract, similar to those of commodities like silver or gold, followed "increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets."


CME's move also comes as the global financial system weighs the degree to which bitcoin should be treated as a currency or a commodity. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the biggest such U.S. exchange, hopes to offer bitcoin futures late this year or early 2018.

**IBD'S TAKE:** JPMorgan's *Jamie Dimon has made clear his doubts about bitcoin. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said the digital currency was "Enron in the making." The man known as "[Bitcoin Jesus](https://www.investors.com/news/jpmorgan-ceo-called-bitcoin-fraud-bitcoin-jesus-begs-to-differ/)" has fewer doubts.*

Other big financial institutions have also been trying to respond to the growing interest of their clients.  The ETF provider ProShares filed for a bitcoin ETF, following applications from others that fell through earlier this year. **Goldman Sachs** ([GS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GS)), meanwhile, has also reportedly considered whether to develop a bitcoin trading platform.


Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's CEO, and **Morgan Stanley** ([MS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MS)) CEO James Gorman have signaled more openness to the bitcoin. Blankfein on Twitter said he wasn't endorsing or rejecting the currency; Gorman, at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal in September, said bitcoin was "more than just a fad."

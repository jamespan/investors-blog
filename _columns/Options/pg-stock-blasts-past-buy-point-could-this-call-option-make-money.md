Investors who are bullish on Proctor & Gamble can consider a long call option to express this view in PG stock.




At one point Wednesday, shares of **Proctor & Gamble** ([PG](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PG)) rallied as much as 3%. The stock also jumped past a 161.31 [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/) after breaking out of a [cup with handle](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/the-basics-how-to-analyze-a-stocks-cup-with-handle/). The move comes after the company posted strong fiscal third-quarter earnings in the premarket session. Net sales of $19.4 billion rose 7% from a year prior, while EPS of $1.33 beat analyst estimates of $1.29. 


PG stock also shows the [relative strength line](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-breakout-specialty-tool-relative-strength-line/) approaching its highest level since the cup pattern began forming.


**PG Stock: Using A Long Call To Take A Bullish View**
------------------------------------------------------


An investor may consider buying the 165 call option in PG stock for the June 17 expiry. This call option has a delta of 43, which is equivalent to being long 43 shares of Proctor and Gamble on inception of this trade. 



The 165 June call costs $3.20. So, this equates to a maximum loss of $320 on the trade. While the maximum loss is the debit paid, potential gains are uncapped. 


This is appealing, as Proctor & Gamble is moving past its buy point now and has a lot of room to move before becoming overextended.


The 5% buy zone in PG stock runs from 161.31 to 169.38.


**Implied Volatility Appears Cheap On Proctor & Gamble**
--------------------------------------------------------


A long call is sensitive to volatility. 



The June 165 call option currently has an implied volatility of 16.5%. This appears to be cheap, considering that Proctor & Gamble has had a realized volatility of 22% over the last 30 trading days. While PG stock will likely realize slightly less volatility until the June expiry — as the company has just reported its earnings on Wednesday — volatility at its current levels is low simply given high market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty.


Investors buying long calls in Proctor & Gamble can consider taking profits if shares become overextended, in the same manner as they would a long stock position. If not, they can hold until expiration. At that point, they will experience a profit if PG shares trade above $168.20 (which equates to the call price plus the premium paid).


Proctor & Gamble shows weaker top- and bottom-line growth in recent quarters vs. names in the IBD 50.


PG stock also sports a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 79, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-procter-and-gamble-pg.aspx). Yet PG ranks second in IBD's cosmetics and personal care group.


The stock may also have room for further appreciation in the event of a continued shift to defensive stocks from high-growth names.

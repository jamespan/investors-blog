Monday's [IBD 50 Stock To Watch](https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-watch-marvell-mrvl-eyes-breakout-new-high-near-buy-point/) pick, **Marvell Technology** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) broke out above a 41.44 buy point. MRVL stock is highly rated with a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 99 and an RS Rating of 91.




For a strong stock such as this, option traders could look at an option strategy known as a bull put spread.


A bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.


To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.


With the buy point at 41.44, traders could look to place the bull put spread just below, at 40.


Bullish MRVL Stock Option Trade
-------------------------------


Traders who think MRVL stock will continue to hold above the buy point could look to sell a November 40 put and buy a 35 put.


As of yesterday, this spread was trading for around $1.30 which means a trader selling this spread would receive $130 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $370.


That represents a 35.14% return on risk between now and November 20 as long as Marvell stock remains above 41.


If Marvell stock closes below 35 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $370.



This is where an options spread has an advantage over uncovered strategies. With a bull put spread, you always know the worst-case scenario even if Marvell stock tanks.


The break-even point for the bull put spread is 38.70, which is calculated as 40 less the $1.30 option premium per contract.


However, for this trade if Marvell stock price dropped below 40, I would close the trade early for a loss.


MRVL stock currently shows implied volatility of 45% which is an IV rank of 51. IV rank measures where the current level of implied volatility sits in relation to the last 12 months.


Marvell's next earnings report isn't due until early December, so there is no earnings risk with this trade.

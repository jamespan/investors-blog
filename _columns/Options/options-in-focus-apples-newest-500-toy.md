If you follow the market closely, there's always some key level of contention amongst investors. Right now, I'd gander **Apple's** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) move towards $500 is one of those price benchmarks that has both bulls and bears thinking about positioning around the latest and greatest number to shake things up. 

  

Personally, I'd think $500 is all but a foregone conclusion. From there, I'd anticipate the powers that be will proceed to jam shares down the throats of bulls biting too hard. Sorry, for the "non-PC" nature of our verbiage. 

  

The extremely good news for traders willing to use options is the variety of positions which go beyond the hard delta, die-by-the-sword directional wager around such a hyped and closely-watched, as well as an already closely played price level. 

  

The even better news is with option volume that typically averages 300,000 a day and surges to more than 1 million contracts on occasion, traders can go from dreaming about the "what if's" and designing positions to tailor fit one's own expectations around a host of variables ranging from direction, time and volatility. 

  

Checking the board and despite all the range of possibilities given Apple's five-point or 1% strike distances; "iThink" it looks like most traders still went for the quick buck or maybe slightly less fast two, three or even five bucks or more in today's session. 

  

Most active, the Weeklys February contract which expire tomorrow saw about 150,000 rather evenly-traded 480s, 485s, 490s, 495s and 500 strike calls trade or basically 50% of an average day's volume all wrapped up in just those four contracts. Not only are those calls expiring tomorrow, but today's volume exploded past the existing open interest in each. 

  

While surely a few are hanging on and waiting for the nectar of $500 before giving any thought to hedging, given the size of AAPL's move of about 3.5% or nearly 17 points and shares zipping through four of those strikes intraday; we'd estimate there was a good deal more "to open" followed by "to close" or "to open" as part of an adjustment, than traders simply hanging onto long and unhedged deltas. On that note and while not agreeing with the initial long call play; the ultra-fast money with little time on their hands look a good deal savvier, even if $500 comes tomorrow and not a moment too soon.

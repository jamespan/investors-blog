Have you ever seen heavy in-the-money call action that's failed to move the stock and wondered what on earth might be behind all those traded contracts? In most instances when you're seeing strong, out of this world and concentrated volume in deep calls with large existing open interest, the activity is likely tied to professional traders attempting to capture a stock's dividend before the ex-date. 

  

How does that work? Most often, traders responsible for the volume are swapping deep vertical spreads in front of the ex-date for the same price with other like-minded traders in negotiated prints. Both sets of traders then exercise the long call contracts from the bull and bear spreads bought and sold over the course of the session. This little feat is allowed even if the spreads net out to zero at the end of the session due to a loop hole compliments of the Options Clearing Corp. 

  

From this point forward, if Lady Luck makes an appearance, the trader can be left with a bunch of buy-writes if the other, other guy i.e. the existing large open interest, is asleep at the wheel and fails to remember to exercise their own long call position in order to collect the dividend. If and that's a big "if", if Lady Luck is kind and the trader winds up not getting assigned on some of his or her calls, they stand to make a quick windfall that's equal to the price of the dividend payout minus the put value (if any) on the strike in which the trader failed to receive a call assignment on. 

  

The reason the put value is important is any buy-writes that are now on the trader's sheets are the synthetic equivalent of a short put. As much, until that risk is tidied up or expires out of the money, there is risk beyond the dividend captured through this play.

  

Before one gets any smart ideas about playing the next ex-dividend that comes around, realize commissions play a large factor in making dividend plays viable or not. Traders also need the help of Lady Luck, as the assignment process on the existing open interest is lottery style according to the O.C.C. 

  

All told, the dividend play is still mostly a prohibitive game when nickels and dimes are generally the prize that a trader is trying to profit from. And for the heftier dividend plays that might amount to fifty-cent pieces or maybe more? The payout would certainly be greater, but the potential of walking away with any short contracts is, in our estimation, even less likely.

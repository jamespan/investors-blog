The most terrifying slide in the investor presentation for **Microsoft**'s ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) $26.2 billion acquisition of **LinkedIn** ([LNKD](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=LNKD)) features this bubble:


The archetypal joke about the deal is an image of the old Microsoft Clippy saying "I'd Like to Add you to My Professional Network on LinkedIn," but Microsoft and LinkedIn, two companies that are impervious to humor, have embraced the same idea. That bubble is Cortana -- Microsoft's digital assistant, sort of a natural-language mobile Clippy -- tapping into poor Jen's LinkedIn network to advise her on her real-life work interactions. "I see you plan to interact with a human," bleats Cortana. "Have you considered talking about your shared interest in sports?" It combines Microsoft's legacy chirpy intrusiveness with LinkedIn's grim determination to pester you with boring information about your acquaintances.


It's such a good idea! Microsoft and LinkedIn are the great software companies of work, of boredom, of getting on the calendar to schedule a meeting. Work is an essentially social activity; it is among our most important social activities. But most work software -- even collaborative interactive whatever software -- does not fully honor that social component; it helps you share the slide presentation but not your love for the Huskies. Meanwhile, a lot of social networking software seems to be designed by, and intended for, people who have never had real jobs. "Make your selfie look like a cartoon dog" is a functionality that I suppose appeals to the tweens craved by advertisers. But, to a certain demographic, "chat up this stranger about Pac-12 football so that he signs a lucrative consulting contract with your company" is far more exciting.


Of course you should read Paul Ford on Microsoft/LinkedIn:


LinkedIn knows a lot about what people do, and Microsoft builds tools for doing lots of specific, difficult things (i.e. programming, project management, making diagrams, managing databases). If there was a single LinkedIn API that let you do things like: Look up people in your company; find relevant consultants; identify the skills needed to solve problems, etc.; that’s a kind of raw power that we don’t really see inside of most software.


But no one has ever bought a social media company to capture its next 12 months of earnings. You buy a social media company to take over the world.


And **Twitter** ([TWTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TWTR)) was up because maybe there's hope for it after all.


The Second Law Of Insider Trading
---------------------------------


The Second Law of Insider Trading is, of course: "If you have inside information about an upcoming merger, don't buy short-dated out-of-the-money call options on the target." If you bought LinkedIn stock on Friday -- it closed at 131.08 -- you made a lot of money over the weekend; Microsoft will pay 196 per share in cash. But if you bought short-dated out-of-the-money call options on LinkedIn on Friday, you made even more money. LinkedIn call options expiring this Friday, with a strike price of 150, traded for 2 cents a share last Friday. They're now worth more than 42 per share. If you're the lucky person who bought, say, the 77 contracts -- 7,700 shares' worth -- that traded at 3:30:13 p.m. on Friday, you paid $154 for options that are now worth more than $325,000, for better than a 200,000% return in about 72 hours.


But there is no particular reason to think that those options violated the Second Law. Those options trade fairly frequently; a total of 237 contracts traded last Friday, compared with 307 the day before that and 562 the previous Friday. Those options were just normal, regularly traded options; most of the people buying and selling them presumably didn't have inside information. Sure, last Friday, with the stock at 131.08 and just a week left to get to 150, those options were a wild gamble, but that's why they only cost 2 cents. The fact that the gamble paid off doesn't mean that anyone knew the outcome in advance.


More suspicious, according to Fortune's Dan Primack and Stephen Gandel, is this trade: One of the LinkedIn options is a call with a strike price of 160 per share, which is the price at which an option starts to make money, that matures on Aug. 19. They first began trading on Feb. 5, which also represented the day with the most contracts sold, at 121 (the only day of triple-digit action). Well, until last Friday, when a whopping 621 contracts were traded.


That makes that option look much more suspicious than the more run-of-the-mill short-dated out-of-the-money call option. And it worked out pretty well too.


It is, of course, possible that last Friday’s buyer (or buyers?) simply had remarkably fortunate timing. Just how lucky? According to data from Bloomberg, 600 options to buy LinkedIn shares at 160 were bought in two trades on Friday afternoon for a total of $135,100. Those same options are now worth just over $2 million, for a less-than-one-trading-day profit of nearly $1.9 million.


Nah. If you look at all of the August 2016 LinkedIn options that traded on Friday, a sadder story emerges. Of the 621 160-strike call options that traded on Friday, 500 traded at exactly 1:40:39 p.m., along with 500 more call options (with a 185 strike price) and 1,200 put options, with 115 and 125 strike prices. Listed equity options are traded through market makers, principal traders who stand ready to buy or sell options from anyone who shows up. They make money on the spread: They'll bid to buy options at one price, offer to sell the same options at a higher price, and keep enough room between the bid and the offer to make some money. Judging by where the LinkedIn options traded, versus the bids and offers at the time, it seems like our mystery trader sold the 160 call options and the 125 puts, and bought the 185 calls and 115 puts. (This is called, embarrassingly, a "broken wing iron condor.") He got paid about $274,500 for doing that, and his payoff profile looked something like this:


That looked like a perfectly fine trade on Friday, with LinkedIn trading at about 132. If it stayed around there -- above 125, below 160 -- through August, nothing would happen, none of the options would pay off, and our trader would keep his $274,500 of premium. If it went down below 125, or above 160, the trader would make less money; below about 120, or above about 166, he would start losing money. But above 185, his losses would be capped, at just under a million dollars.


At the deal price of 196, our trader is just a little bit off the right side of that chart. Oops!


Of course the market-making firm who was on the other side of these trades -- and who, in particular, bought those 160 calls -- made a (quick, lucky) profit on the trade, though it probably hedged, so its profit was probably nowhere near a million dollars. But the market maker, who just passively buys and sells options based on customer demand, is unlikely to have had any inside information. The market maker really did just get lucky.


Some of the other LinkedIn options that traded on Friday probably weren't paired with other trades, and were just bets that LinkedIn would go up. Some of them paid off. Maybe some of them were made with inside information! Who knows. But this trade seems to have been a bet that LinkedIn's stock wouldn't go anywhere, and it's hard to believe that the mystery trader who put it on -- and lost almost a million dollars over the weekend -- had any inside information.

With the market up 20% to more than 30% in 2013, depending on which index you follow, some analysts expect a quiet December and only modest gains before the new year, the new Fed Chair and new budget battles grab the market's attention. What can an options trader to do?

  

Bull call spreads can offer an excellent risk/reward ratio for a modestly rising market.

  

A *bull call* spread involves buying one call and simultaneously selling another call on the same underlying stock, with the same expiration date, but with a higher strike price.

  

As a hypothetical example, consider the January options on Leaderboard member Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) which, at 124.00, is approximately 4% past a 118.39 buy point from a double-bottom base and slightly back in the buy zone. After dipping below its double-bottom entry earlier this month, the stock got back on track, finding support at its 50-day moving average. Also, its Relative Price Strength Rating has improved.

  

With ALXN trading at 124.00 on Monday, the January 125 Call was trading near 5.20, and the January 130 Call was near 3.20. Using these prices, a "125-130 bull call spread" on ALXN could be created as follows:

  

Buy one Jan 125 Call @ 5.20 or $520 debit  
Sell one Jan 130 Call @ 3.20 or $320 credit  
Net (2.00) or $200 debit

  

Commissions are not included in this example and bull call spreads must be established in a margin account.

  

In the bull call spread described above, the risk is limited to $2.00 per share or $200, not including commissions, and the profit potential is limited to $3.00 per share, or $300. The per-share profit is calculated by subtracting the net cost of the spread, 2.00, from the difference of 5 between the strike prices, (130 â€” 125 = 5.00). In general, the maximum risk of a bull call spread is the net cost paid including commissions.

  

In this example, maximum profit is achieved if the stock price is above the higher strike price at expiration, which is 130 in this example, and the maximum loss is realized if the stock is below the lower strike price, or 125, at expiration, and both options expire. The break-even point at expiration is equal to the lower strike price plus the net cost, or 125.00 + 2.00 = 127.00. 

  

The potential profit of 3.00 in this example is 150% of the risk, and the stock only has to rise 4.80% from 124 to 130 for this profit to be realized. On the flip side, 100% of the cost of the bull call spread is lost if the stock price does not change, in which case a long stock position would break even.

  

Since a bull call spread consists of one long call and one short call, the combined position is less susceptible to the effects of time decay and fluctuations in implied volatility than an outright long call position. Another benefit is the reduced cost and risk relative to only the purchased call. The tradeoffs are that potential profits are limited and commissions may be higher.

  

If you believe that December will be a bullish month, but less so than the last few months, then a bull call spread might be the right options strategy for you.

With market volatility near the lowest levels we've seen this year, it might be an excellent time to think about portfolio protection. After all, the next stock market correction could be just around the corner.




Traders with a large bullish exposure may want to consider adding some protection.


Some traders will buy VIX call options as a method of protecting against rising volatility. Let's look at an example.


The trade is a butterfly spread on the VIX, or [CBOE Market Volatility Index](https://research.investors.com/psychological-market-indicators/chart?type=volatility), that will profit if VIX rises to between 20.50 and 29.50 on June 21.


A typical butterfly would be constructed as follows:


* Buy 1 in-the-money call
* Sell 2 at-the-money calls
* Buy 1 out-of-the-money call


Today, we will center the butterfly at 25. That will give us some protection if the VIX rises to that level in the next month.


* Buy 1 June 21, 20 call at 1.95
* Sell 2 June 21 25 calls at 1.05 each
* Buy 1 June 21 30 call at 0.65


The total cost of this trade is $50, and that is the maximum loss potential on the trade.


Maximum Gain $450, Cost Is $50
------------------------------


The maximum gain is $450, which is calculated by taking the difference in strike prices less the premium paid ($500 less $50).


The break-even prices are 20.50 and 29.50 (lower strike plus the premium and upper strike minus the premium).


A butterfly options trade has a tentlike shape, with the potential for very large profits around the short strike. It's important to keep in mind that it's unlikely you would ever achieve the maximum profit.


Trade Protects Against Volatility Spike
---------------------------------------


This trade will give some protection in the event of a large spike in volatility in the coming weeks.


I would typically hold this hedge trade through to expiration and would be willing to accept a full loss.


Keep in mind, this trade does not give any protection if VIX spikes above 29.50.


VIX options behave slightly differently from stock options, so make sure you understand how they work before risking any real capital.

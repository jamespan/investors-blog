Entering the final stretch of Thursday's session, it was largely unsurprising that the S&P 500 was up on the day despite **Cisco**'s ([CSCO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CSCO)) below views outlook due to macro-economic conditions. Our basis for expecting investors would put on their bargain-hunting caps is based on the market pricing in a whole lot of fearful negativity in a short period of time, entering the session. And that's largely due to excessive behavior manifesting itself in the VIX. 

  

"The VIX, you say?" The market's most notorious measure of market sentiment finally pushed above April's high mark near 21% on Wednesday and one set during the last and very brief market correction off intermediate and multi-year highs. Coupled with a fearful, 10-day simple moving average versus cash differential in excess of 20% and action prone to mean reversion when greater than 15%, value or bargain-hunting bulls had some honest-to- goodness, relative fear to consider and in need of correcting in a more pleasant market moving sort of way. 

  

Looking ahead and with the VIX down about 6% near 19%, some of our anticipated backing and filling into a more neutralized state of behavior has been secured. Relative to the 10-day simple moving average though, the VIX remains about 6% above the important short-term line. As much, we don't think it's time yet to "Sell in May." 

  

At the moment, bearishly aligned "sell in May" action would be required if the sentiment gauge fell below its one month low of 15.8% and proceeded to complacently stretch itself 15% or more below the 10-day simple moving average. That said, barring a follow-through day from today's rally attempt confirmation or simply a break of Wednesday's lows; investors doing some nibbling are warned not to "go away" either. In the end, a neutralized bear after a couple days of rest, may be about as good as it gets for bargain-hunters.

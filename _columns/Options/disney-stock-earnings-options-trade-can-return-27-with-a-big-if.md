**Walt Disney** ([DIS](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DIS)) stock is showing elevated implied volatility, with an I.V. Percentile reading of 96%.




That means that the current level of implied volatility is higher than 96% of all other stocks' readings in the past 12 months. 


In part, that is because the company is due to report earnings after the close Wednesday, and we typically see elevated implied volatility around that event. 


Traders who think Disney stock will not move too much following the earnings report could look at an iron condor trade. 


Disney Stock Iron Condor Trade
------------------------------


Let's look at an example using [Disney stock](https://www.investors.com/research/disney-stock-buy-now/). 


As a reminder, an iron condor is a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread. 


The idea with the trade is to profit from time decay while expecting that the stock will not move too much in either direction. 



First, we take the bull put spread. Using the Feb. 11 expiry, we could sell the 133-strike put and buy the 128 put. That spread could be sold on Friday for around $0.38. 


Then the bear call spread is made, which could be placed by selling the 155 call and buying the 160 call. This spread could be sold on Friday for around $0.69. 


In total, the iron condor will generate around $1.07 per contract or $107 of premium. 


The profit zone ranges between 131.93 and 156.07. This can be calculated by taking the short strikes and adding or subtracting the premium received. 


Maximum Trade Risk
------------------


Because both spreads are $5 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 5 - 1.07 x 100 = $393. 


Therefore, if we take the premium ($107) divided by the maximum risk ($393), this iron condor trade has the potential to return 27.23%. 


If price action stabilizes, then iron condors will work well. However, if Disney stock makes a bigger than expected move, the trade will suffer losses. 


Trades held over earnings allow little room for adjusting, so they can be a bit hit-or-miss. Disney has stayed within the expected range following four out of the last five earnings releases. But, as we know, past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. 


Disney stock is ranked No. 16 in its group and has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 39, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 66 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 25. 


After the Q3 earnings release, Disney stock dropped 7.1%, so that is also something to consider. 


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

In this column, we've mainly looked at some of the standard option trades like [bull put spreads](https://www.investors.com/research/options/nvidia-stock-and-options-trading-can-this-bull-put-spread-deliver/) and [cash-secured puts](https://www.investors.com/research/options/ford-stock-after-bullish-breakout-option-traders-eye-cash-secured-put/).Â Today, we are going to look at one of the less common option strategies, called a put ratio backspread.




A put backspread involves selling a put and then buying two further out-of-the-money puts. This strategy is used when a trader is expecting a large drop in a particular stock.  

The advantage of using a backspread is a much lower cost than simply buying a put option. The positive vega also helps generate profits in the event of a sell-off.


Let's look at an example.


Assume a trader wants to protect against a big drop in **Bank of America** ([BAC](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BAC)).


A put ratio backspread will do well if BAC stock suffers a significant drop and will not lose any money if Bank of America stock stays flat or rallies. The risk on the trade is a small, slow decline in the stock price. If a decline is to happen, a hard and fast drop is best.


Let's break down this trade:


* Sell one Aug. 20 expiration 42-strike put at $1.80.  

Buy two Aug. 20 39-strike puts at 80 cents each.


The trade can be placed for a net credit of $20, calculated by taking the credit received for selling the 42 put ($180) less the premium paid for the two 39 puts ($160).  

If BAC stock stays above 42 at expiration, the trader keeps the small amount of premium.


Trade On BAC Stock Could Lose $280
----------------------------------


The maximum loss occurs if Bank of America finishes at 39 on the expiration day, in which case the trader would lose $280 on the trade. This is calculated by taking the difference between the short and long strikes x 100 ($300) and subtracting the premium received ($20).



The maximum gain is unlimited up to the point the stock reaches $0. The break-even prices are 36.20 and 41.80.


This is an advanced trading strategy and not recommended for beginners.


The ideal scenario for the trade is a large drop (and associated rise in implied volatility) within the first two weeks. Otherwise, flat or higher prices are fine, too.


Earnings for Bank of America are expected in mid-July, so there is earnings risk with this trade.


BAC stock has a [Composite Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/) of 90, an [EPS Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/growth-stocks-and-how-to-analyze-earnings-growth-using-ibd-eps-rating/) of 79 and a [Relative Strength Rating](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/relative-strength-rating-stock-chart-analysis-helps-pick-outstanding-growth-stocks/) of 81.

How should a bullish trader go about handling a breakout, which has both a market deemed "under pressure" and lower volume backing up the move, to deal with? Well, if the name in question happens to be shares of **Baidu** ([BIDU](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BIDU)), traders do have the provision of considering its options and any one of a number of strategies and myriad of configurations using various listed strikes and months available. 

  

Shares of BIDU bucked the broader market's own continued weakness by closing higher by 0.82% and triggering a below average volume handle breakout within a corrective cup-shaped base. With a less-than-ideal mix of technical signs, one idea for bulls still optimistic on the name might be the use of a vertical spread. 

  

BIDU options are currently bid well above statistical and recent trading range values as earnings are set to be released after the close Wednesday night. Once the results are out and regardless of the reaction in shares, those elevated implieds should find themselves prone to a volatility crush as the uncertainty surrounding the event is removed. 

  

A vertical spread which sells and buys an equal amount of same month call or put contracts and hedges / dampens volatility risk, makes all the more sense. Volatility risk is minimized, as are those sometimes hard-to-handle deltas, particularly when it comes to earnings and the reaction to the report. 

  

If traders wish to play the event as a bull and keep the position tied as much to the earnings event as possible, one could establish a vertical in the July Weeklys which will expire this coming Friday. 

  

The advantage of a short holding period with a vertical is the opportunity to see the spread expand to it's a maximum profit potential very quickly. The downside of course, is well the downside. With very little time on the calendar, a bearish reaction is going to likely expose the trader to seeing his or her risk exposure realized just as quickly.

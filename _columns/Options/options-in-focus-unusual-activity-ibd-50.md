In the top spot Tuesday for unusual options volume within the IBD 50, **Questor Pharmaceuticals**  ([QCOR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QCOR)) is flashing about three times its daily average on about 2,000 options with shares off about 4%. Imbuing bulls and bears into action, the headlines don't yield much of a clue with "Risk Creates Opportunity" from MarketWatch and "4 Stocks with Potential for the New Year" courtesy of Forbes trying to tease and cajole bulls into a more offensive frame of mind.

  

With today's pressure in shares, QCOR is breaking key 50-day simple moving average support. The action has also damaged a prior breakout attempt from a four-week flat base which triggered back in early December as the stock is now more than 8% below its proper buy point of 44.61. 

  

Most active on the option side and for all intents and purposes, the only decisive action on the day, nearly 1,200 slightly out-of-the money January 37 puts on multiple and varied prints have traded compared to almost non-existent open interest of 33 contracts. 

  

Priced at $1.27 mid-market, a long put purchase would require a maximum move of 14% by expiration in order to double in value to about $2.50. Our guesstimate, based on the fast deteriorating technical picture, sees the put purchase as the most likely beneficiary of today's opening activity from traders. 

  

Knowing there's two sides to every trade though, Tuesday's initiating traders, which we'd also gather is the result of a newsletter recommendation, could be using a "targeted purchase" strategy, which more commonly is known as a put sale and less acknowledged, as the risk equivalent of the buy-write.

  

And as we stated just last week, when it comes to options and the fact stock can always complicate just which side of the trade our two parties are in fact on, we'd be remiss not to mention the possibility of a married put or the less likely synthetic short call as positions. For its part, with shares at 39.90, the married put or long synthetic call affords bulls protection at the strike price minus the premium paid. This adds up to, without really knowing if it adds up at expiration, to risk of about $4.15 per contract below 35.75 using $1.25 as the put price.

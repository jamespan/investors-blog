Knowing the reasons why option prices behave the way they do may help you become a better trader.

  

Let's begin with a two-question test. Carefully read the beginning assumptions before choosing your answers.

  

**Three assumptions:**

  

1. The price of XYZ stock is $50.   
2. It is 90 days to option expiration.  
3. The price of the XYZ 90-day, 50-strike call is 3.25.

  

**Question 1:** If the stock price rises from $50 to $51 today (assume no change in time to expiration), what do you expect the price of the 50-strike call will be?

  

Choose one:

  

a. The call price will remain unchanged at 3.25.  
b. The call price will rise by 0.25 to 3.50.  
c. The call price will rise by 0.50 to 3.75.  
d. The call price will rise by 1.00 to 4.25.

  

**Question 2:** With the beginning assumptions the same, if the stock price remains unchanged (at $50) for 45 days and other factors such as interest rates, dividends and volatility remain the same, what do you expect the price of the 50-strike call will be?

  

Choose one:

  

a. The call price will decrease by 0.50 to 2.75.  
b. The call price will decrease by 1.00 to 2.25.  
c. The call price will decrease by 1.50 to 1.75.  
d. The call price will decrease by 1.675 to 1.675.

  

**The Answers**

  

To find the answers, look at Table 1. The cell in the middle row of the 90-day column is the starting point for both questions. The stock price is $50, there are 90 days to expiration, and the indicated price of the 50-strike call is "3.25."

  

To find the answer to Question 1, look up one row in the same column where the stock price is $51 with 90 days to expiration. The indicated price of the 50-strike call is now "3.75," so the answer to Question 1 is "c. The call price will rise by 0.50 to 3.75."

  

For the answer to Question 2, look at the cell in the middle row of the 45-day column where the Stock Price is $50 and there are 45 days to expiration. The indicated price of the 50-strike call is "2.25," so the answer to Question 2 is "b. The call price will decrease by 1.00 to 2.25."

  

**Question 1: The Concept of Delta**

  

The important concept from Question 1 is that option prices almost always change less than stock prices. In this example, the stock rose by $1.00 from $50 to $51, but the 50-strike call rose by 50 cents from 3.25 to 3.75. In options, the term "delta" is used to describe the expected change in an option's price for a $1 change in the underlying stock's price. In this case, the stock price rose by $1 (from $50 to $51) and the 50-strike call rose by 50 cents (from 3.25 to 3.75), so this call would be described as having a delta of "0.50."

  

**Question 2: The Concept of Non-linear Time decay**

  

From Question 2 we see that, assuming factors other than time to expiration remain constant, prices of at-the-money options do not decrease evenly over time. In this case, the time to expiration decreased by 50% from 90 days to 45 days. The price of the 50-strike call, however, decreased by approximately 31% from 3.25 to 2.25.

  

**Developing Realistic Expectations**

  

Mastering the concepts in Table 1 — delta and time decay — is an important step toward the goal of developing realistic expectations about how option prices might and might not change.  Tables similar to Table 1 can be created using any standard option pricing software. Table 1 was created using the Options Calculator, a free program available on the web site of The Chicago Board Options Exchange (<http://www.cboe.com/>) under the TOOLS tab.

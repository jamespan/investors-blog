Invesco QQQ Trust ([QQQ](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QQQ)) represents the Nasdaq 100, and it closed near the low of the day yesterday. Meanwhile, the broader Nasdaq composite sliced through its [50-day moving average](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-stocks-big-break-below-50-day-line-can-mark-end-of-a-huge-run/) for the first time since the Nov. 1 follow-through day. With the [market uptrend under pressure](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/the-big-picture/stock-market-nasdaq-sp500-dow-jones-treasury-yields/), today we'll look at a trade that will do well if QQQ drops to around 410.




Taking A Bearish Position On Nasdaq 100
---------------------------------------


This is a bearish calendar trade, where we sell a short-term put and buy a longer-term put. Placing the calendar below the current price of QQQ gives the trade it's bearish outlook.


Here's the trade:


* Sell the April 26, 410 strike put for around 97 cents.
* Buy the May 10, 410 strike put for around $2.60.


That results in a net cost for the trade of $1.63 per spread. That is also the most the trade can lose.


It's a big benefit that many of the spread trades can get set up where you know your worst-case scenario from the start.


Winning On The Trade
--------------------


The estimated maximum profit is around $570, but that could vary depending on changes in implied volatility.


The idea with the trade is that if the Nasdaq 100 drops, this trade gets more profitable. To a point.


As QQQ approaches 410 by April 26, the calendar spread will increase in value. At 410 the short put expires worthless and the long put still has a couple weeks of time value. That allows the trade to be closed for a profit.


But if the Nasdaq 100 keeps going lower, the profit will wane and eventually turn to a loss again.


The profit window for QQQ is roughly between 395 and 428 at the April 26 expiration.


The position starts with a delta of -7, meaning the exposure is roughly equivalent to being short 7 shares of QQQ stock, although this will change as the trade progresses.


Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

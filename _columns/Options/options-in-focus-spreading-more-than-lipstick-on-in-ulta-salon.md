  Options In Focus: Spreading More Than Lipstick On In Ulta Salon

Amidst Thursday's early hem and haw around the unchanged mark, one or perhaps two customers decided to establish an intermediate-term ratio spread in cosmetics retailer **Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance** ([ULTA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ULTA)) in front of tonight's earnings release. 

  

Wearing my other writing cap at Optionetics, I uncovered a 2 x 3 December 50 / 45 put spread which went up 2,000 x 3,000 with a small debit of $0.36 being paid out by the trader buying two of the 50 puts while selling three of the 45s. 

  

One item we didn't note was the action of selling more of the further out-of-the money contracts is referred to as "selling the frontspread" as a small credit is often generated. With the debit paid in this instance, some clarification seems in order for readers just learning about ratio spreads. 

  

We went on to say we liked the prospect of the last two months of corrective action as putting together a potential first stage base after re-setting ULTA's long-standing base count and prior uptrend. However, with shares squarely at the 50% retracement level from its July all-time-highs to August lows and near the closely watched 50-day simple moving average, the question of "Is she ugly or pretty" may have begged some debate from bears. 

  

  

Back to this rather massive spread in a product not known to attract option traders collective attention, I'm personally candid about not having a strong grasp on which side the customer(s) were on. If I were to dare call one side more attractive than the other, I think I'd have to go with "buying" this particular frontspread. 

  

Shown above, we've illustrated a scaled down 2 x (3) front-spread position. The trader with this position doesn't stand to lose or gain much until and if shares of ULTA trade down below the 50 strike, though we might expect some benefit from the position's short vega structure in the near-term. 

  

Moving into expiration is where this position sees its largest profit. On our two 2 x (3) spread profits approach $1000 at the 45 strike as the 50 puts gain intrinsic value of $5 apiece and the 45s used to finance the operation, go out worthless. Breaking even is well-removed at $35.36 and should he or she so chose, the option to go long stock on assignment below 45 with profits in hand could exist. 

  

Of course or as the trader needs to accept, the really risqué business is if that rouge colored line shown in our risk graph is applied to an overly-bearish move. In that case, this bear who might also be a bull in costume at certain price levels, will face a slightly more difficult-to-handle decision regarding the position and his or her longer-term desires in ULTA.

If one word could describe the 2024 presidential campaign, it is “improbable.” Whether the incumbent nominee’s unexpected withdrawal, the assassination attempts, or the remarkable comeback of a previously defeated president to win a second term, this election was a stark reminder of just how uncertain the future can be, and a testament to the value of reliable forecasts and information about the future.

As in previous elections, the forecasts we rely on let us down. The polls were wrong. The pundits were wrong. The regulators were wrong, too, in claiming that legalized election betting would threaten election integrity.

In fact, the election betting markets were a rare bright spot in this political cycle. These markets, offered on platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi, provided the most timely and insightful forecasts of the electoral outcome.

The prediction markets forecast Trump’s win accurately and early. The final market odds as of election morning gave Donald Trump roughly a 20% greater chance of winning over Kamala Harris. Prediction markets also correctly picked Trump to win the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Nevada.

In contrast, the polls caused confusion, the forecasters hedged, and the pundits misfired throughout the election cycle. Nate Silver, revered by many as the dean of poll-based forecasts, declared the election 50-50. (His

gave Harris a small lead).

Other polling forecasts fared no better. FiveThirtyEight also said it was dead even, and the Economist

To be sure, many pollsters hedged. “A close race in the polls…does not necessarily mean the outcome will be close,” the Economist wrote. Others made similar points. But the bottom line is that Americans were better off following the election markets than trying to mentally correct for potential polling errors.

This was hardly the first election when betting markets were a reliable guide to the voting. U.S. political betting has served as an informal but influential metric of electoral sentiment for

. The

—decades before algorithms, data modeling, social media, and the 24-hour news cycle—followed an almost identical script. Betting markets were held on the curbs outside Wall Street. The market pulse helped inform the public of the election outcome at a time when scientific polling didn’t even exist. The adage at the time was that “Wall Street betting odds are never wrong.” Just like today, bettors took cues from campaigns, regional whispers, and on-the-ground reporting to put their money where their mouth was.

In contrast, consider polls. They suffer from sample biases, respondent reluctance, and interpretation challenges. All of those limitations can undermine their accuracy.

Betting markets, by contrast, thrive on a simple premise: Real money follows conviction. Participants in these markets are trading based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative information, including information that is hard to capture in polls.

Critics often dismiss political betting as vulnerable to manipulation, a playground for the wealthy, and even a threat to democracy. This skepticism has some precedent. Accusations of insider manipulation circulated in the 20th century, too, but they had little lasting effect on market forecasts.

In 2024, accusations arose that deep-pocketed traders were shifting odds to favor Donald Trump. But this turned out to be incorrect. The source of concern was later


[revealed to beExternal link](https://www.wsj.com/finance/trump-odds-polymarket-election-betting-whale-3d94bed3?mod=article_inline)


a trader merely betting on his opinion that Trump was going to win. Betting flows revealed that large, sudden wagers did little to change the long-term outlook and were often corrected by a swarm of smaller bets balancing the odds. This self-correcting mechanism of the market is both its strength and a testament to its democratic nature.

Government regulators have also chimed in with concerns. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has historically balked at legalizing election markets in the U.S., citing fears of market manipulation and potential efforts to influence the election outcome itself. Its chair has


[spoken againstExternal link](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/cftc-wants-to-ban-trades-tied-to-elections-sports-and-awards-contests-3d6fb3c6?mod=article_inline)


the idea of the CFTC acting as an “election cop.” Yet, in 2024, hundreds of millions of regulated dollars and billions more in offshore bets failed to spark such issues. The doomsday predictions didn’t materialize.

The 2024 election poses a challenge to the CFTC’s position. Over a century of history shows no evidence that such manipulation has ever substantially undermined electoral processes. The absence of significant manipulation or impact on election outcomes throughout their history undercuts the central argument against legalization. These markets serve the public interest in informing citizens.

Political betting markets are more than just novelties. Legalizing and regulating these markets would harness their potential for the benefit of the national interest. The stakes are high, but if 2024 has proved anything, it’s that these betting markets will probably be more prominent in future elections. Rather than fight it, the general public, politicians, and the regulators would be well served to embrace it.

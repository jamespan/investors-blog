President Richard Nixon ended the U.S.’s promise to exchange dollars for gold at a fixed price in 1971.











Could an escalation of tariffs wind up hurting one of America’s most successful exports, the U.S. dollar?


That could be an unintended consequence of President-elect Donald Trump’s key economic proposal. By restricting the flow of goods, the corresponding flows of capital could also be crimped, reducing the global use of the greenback. 


 For TS Lombard’s chief U.S. economist, Steven Blitz, the promised imposition of tariffs conjures images of President Richard Nixon closing the so-called gold window. The U.S. in 1971 ended its promise to exchange dollars for gold at a fixed price of \$35 an ounce for official foreign holders, such as governments. That, in turn, ultimately led to the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of fixed currency exchange rates. 


The effective devaluation of the dollar was followed by a sharp escalation of oil prices by OPEC and “quickly turned ’60s inflation into ’70s inflation,” when prices soared at double-digit rates even with a steep recession in 1973-74, he wrote in a client note. 





Now, he continues, the aggressive use of tariffs threatens to upset the global system that has lasted over half a century. The U.S. maintains a relatively stable dollar, even with widening trade and budget deficits, so the rest of the world buys U.S. assets while they sell their products into the American market. 


The rest of the world also uses dollars as the primary means of exchange for their goods and financial transactions as well as a store of value. No other currency can match it for the strength and size of the dollar-based bank and financial system, which in turn results in a virtuous circle. 


The dollar is widely used because everybody uses it. In a New York Times column
[this past week](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/opinion/columnists/elon-musk-twitter-bluesky.html)
, economist Paul Krugman likened the dollar to

Excel spreadsheet, which is similarly widely used—not because people love it, but because others use it as well.


Except that Google Sheets is a widely used alternative, including at
*Barron’s*
, where we can edit spreadsheets online. Among currencies, however, no similar substitute for the dollar has come forward.


A so-called Brics currency touted by Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone nowhere,

in Foreign Policy this past week. The scheme to displace the greenback with a common currency from countries of that acronym—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—is mainly backed by Russia, largely because of sanctions imposed on it after its invasion of Ukraine that have blocked it from the dollar network. China has been less enthusiastic owing to the development of its own digital currency and its extensive capital controls, she noted.


Tariffs, however, have the potential of breaking the “contract” on which the world has grown accustomed to since the mid-80s, according to Blitz. The rest of the world ships their excess output to the U.S., which holds down goods inflation in exchange for dollar assets. Most of that foreign capital has gone to support U.S. debt, he adds. At the same time, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (aka quantitative easing) allowed the U.S. to be less dependent on foreign capital.


This balancing act is sustainable as long as inflation and the budget deficit relative to U.S. gross domestic product don’t get too high, Blitz continues. But tariffs may upset this balance and could lead to negative consequences for inflation and unemployment.


If Trump succeeds in eliminating the U.S. trade deficit, the ultimate ironic result could be

. In the 1960s, economist Robert Triffin concluded that a nation that issued a global reserve currency would have to run a persistent current-account deficit. This came to be known as the “Triffin Dilemma,” requiring the U.S. both to juggle deficits to supply dollar liquidity for global growth while maintaining confidence in the dollar.


This is a longer-term concern, however. The
[U.S. Dollar Index](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/indexes/dxy?mod=md_home_overview_quote&mod=article_inline)
is up 6.7% since late September and 3.5% since just before the U.S. elections, as markets priced in the Republican wins of the White House and both chambers of Congress. The greenback’s gains have come as 10-year Treasury yields rose sharply, by 0.8 percentage point since mid-September to 4.42% late Thursday. U.S. stocks have risen in tandem, undeterred by either higher yields or a pricier dollar, factors that typically are negative for earnings and equity valuations. Bitcoin also has soared to near a record of \$100,000, which hardly is a vote of confidence in the U.S. dollar.


It will be interesting to see the new administration’s response to a strong dollar, given Trump’s oft-stated preference for a weak currency to deter imports and boost exports. Deliberate dollar debasement could further turn off the rest of the world to the U.S. currency. 


To believe that the U.S. can erect barriers to trade with the rest of the world without unintended consequences is a fairy tale, Blitz concludes. To paraphrase John Connally, Nixon’s Treasury secretary, the dollar may then be both our currency and our problem.

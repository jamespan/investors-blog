Weaker growth caused concerns that Pinterest’s profit margins would increase less than anticipated.











Investors looking for stock ideas could do worse than [Pinterest](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/PINS) , a website devoted to surfacing ideas for recipes, clothes, and pretty much anything else.


Pinterest stock has had a tough time recently. Shares have fallen 15% to \$29 from an early October multimonth peak, with most of the decline coming after the company reported [third-quarter earnings](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pinterest-stock-ai-spending-meta-a7dd3056?mod=article_inline) earlier this month. The problem was Pinterest’s guidance. Management called for fourth-quarter sales to rise 16%, to \$1.14 billion, from the previous year, a touch slower than the third quarter’s better-than-expected 18% growth.


 That wasn’t what investors wanted to hear. Pinterest is operating in a digital advertising market worth dozens of billions of dollars every year, so growth should be stable or accelerating, not slowing. The weaker growth caused concerns that the business wasn’t up to snuff, meaning that profit margins would increase less than previously anticipated. 


They needn’t worry. For starters, management [often underpromises and overdelivers on sales](https://www.wsj.com/tech/pinterest-ceo-leadership-ready-ipay-adp-williams-sonoma-e8741ba4?mod=article_inline) . It reported better third-quarter growth than its earlier 17% midpoint guidance. Analysts cue off the guidance to arrive at their estimates, and the company has surpassed sales estimates in 18 out of the past 20 quarters, according to FactSet. Pinterest could be setting expectations low so it can deliver a pleasant surprise when it reports its fourth-quarter numbers in February.


Slowing growth in [the food and beverage area](https://www.barrons.com/articles/snack-food-slump-inflation-not-obesity-meds-pepsico-general-mills-e2ac5e90?mod=article_inline) explains why guidance was weak—and why growth will eventually reaccelerate. Those brands have had to pull back on ad spending because of their own weak demand, but otherwise revenue growth in the third quarter was above 20%. And when food sellers see improving trends, they should spend more on advertising again.


“In Pinterest’s defense, it is dealing with a soft Food & Beverage advertising vertical,” writes Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney, who maintained his Outperform rating and \$45 price target. “Fundamental trends should be sustainable, given the market & product cycles currently going on at Pinterest.” 


Pinterest’s innovations should allow it to remain competitive—and growing. They include “deep links,” which allow marketers to directly send users to their product pages to make purchases. Pinterest has also invested in artificial intelligence, enabling it to show users personalized content and match them with the right products. These features increase the likelihood that advertisers will convert shoppers into buyers, which supports the ad prices brands will pay and brings more advertisers to the platform. 


They’re a major reason analysts expect most of the revenue growth to come from higher average revenue per user, or ARPU. The consensus estimate calls for 9% annual ARPU growth through 2026, according to FactSet, eventually reaching \$8. It’s got plenty of room for long-term growth. For context, the dominant [Meta Platforms](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/META) ’ ARPU is expected to come in this year at \$51, though Pinterest doesn’t have to reach that level to satisfy investors. Along with a few million more monthly active users each year, that translates into a possibly conservative 15% annual sales growth to an expected \$4.8 billion by 2026.


Pinterest may be able to beat those numbers, but it doesn’t need to for earnings to grow. That’s because the company hasn’t increased its spending as quickly as revenue is rising. Analysts expect profit margins to rise and for earnings before interest, tax depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, to grow 26% annually through 2026, eventually reaching \$1.5 billion. 


“We continue to see a fundamental revenue and margin inflection for PINS,” writes Mahaney. 


The earnings growth could be enough to boost the company’s market value. Its enterprise value is currently about 14 times expected Ebitda for the next 12 months, below the slower-growing 
[S&P 500 index](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) and down from a peak of about 17 times. It’s also cheaper than larger internet peers with similar revenue growth and higher margins, such as [Booking Holdings](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/BKNG) and [Airbnb](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/ABNB) . 


If Pinterest can boost its margins and earn similar multiples, the stock would be an idea worth pinning.

Billionaires are getting richer, and more plentiful. The 18 wealthiest people on Earth, with fortunes of at least \$50 billion apiece, have a collective worth of nearly \$2 trillion. They represent 16% of total billionaire wealth—four times that of a decade earlier, according to a report from research firm Altrata. The global billionaire pool grew 4%, to 3,323 individuals, in 2023 from a year earlier, with total wealth up 9% to a record \$12.1 trillion.


 Altrata’s Wealth-X unit, which collects global wealth data, notes that wealth isn’t evenly distributed, even among the ultrawealthy. Some 84% of billionaires are worth \$1 billion to \$5 billion and hold 42% of total billionaire wealth. Another 41% is held by 6%, or 194 individuals, with net worth of \$10 billion or more.






North American billionaires fared best in 2023, up 9.9%, to 1,111, as rising stocks fueled a 15.7% boost in wealth, the report says. The main driver: megacap tech stocks. India saw the biggest percentage jump in billionaires—16 to 131—fourth behind the U.S., China, and Germany. China’s billionaires fell by nearly 15%, to 304, as its economy sputtered.

Men still dominate, but women are slowly gaining. Last year, there were 431 women billionaires—13% of the total. Nearly 38% inherited their wealth, including [Walmart](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/wmt?mod=article_chiclet)  heir Alice Walton (the richest woman in the world) and Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, the granddaughter of [L’Oréal](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/or?countrycode=fr&mod=article_chiclet) founder Eugène Schueller.

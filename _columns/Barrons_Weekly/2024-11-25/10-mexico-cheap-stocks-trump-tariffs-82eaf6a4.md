  Trade watchers don’t expect President-elect Donald Trump to blow up the U.S.-Mexico-Agreement on free trade. He ushered it in himself in 2018, and junking the pact would probably hurt U.S. auto makers and others Trump aims to protect.

Mexico’s new president promises to cut the deficit to 4% of GDP, which assumes 2025 growth of 2% to 3%.











Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, faces a rough ride from a returning President Donald Trump. She isn’t strengthening her country’s defenses. 


Investors hoped that Sheinbaum, who took office on Oct. 1, might repair some of the havoc that her predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, wreaked on Mexican assets in his final months. The 2024 budget deficit ballooned to nearly 6% of gross domestic product. A new congress with supermajorities for López Obrador’s Morena party rammed through a roundly condemned judicial “reform” that replaces all 7,000 or so Mexican judges with elected successors. 


 The 
[iShares MSCI Mexico](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/funds/eww?mod=article_chiclet) exchange-traded fund (ticker: EWW) has plunged by a quarter since elections in June. The peso has dropped 17% against the dollar.


Sheinbaum’s early moves have proved cautious at best. Her first budget, presented to legislators on Nov. 15, promises to cut the deficit to 4% of GDP. But that assumes 2025 growth of 2% to 3%, while her own central bank projects 1.5% and is fuzzy on where to cut. “I have a fairly robust degree of skepticism,” says Sarah Glendon, senior sovereign analyst for Latin America at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “There is still some underperformance to come in the bonds.”


Sheinbaum’s choice to head Petróleos Mexicanos, the state-owned oil monopoly with sinking production and \$100 billion or so in debt, is an anti-privatization professor who has never managed anything. “He certainly doesn’t have what Pemex needs most, financial acumen to sort out the business,” says Duncan Wood, president of the Pacific Council on International Policy. 


That’s all before Trump comes back with his [tariffs-for-everyone](https://www.barrons.com/articles/us-election-president-trump-harris-trade-wars-662af597?mod=Searchresults&mod=article_inline) campaign pledge and a “review” of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on free trade pending in 2026.


Trade watchers don’t expect Trump to blow up the USMCA. He ushered it in himself in 2018 to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, proclaiming it “the best agreement we’ve ever made.”


Junking the pact would also probably hurt U.S. auto makers and others Trump aims to protect. “The USMCA has been positive for U.S. employment, wages, capital expenditures, production, and profits” in the auto sector, the U.S. Trade Representative reported to Congress this summer.


Talks will probably focus on [Chinese investment](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tariffs-who-gets-hurt-mexico-china-d1da2d50?mod=Searchresults&mod=article_inline) in Mexico, says Kenneth Smith Ramos, Mexico’s chief negotiator on USMCA. That has nearly tripled since 2019 to \$3.8 billion last year as Chinese auto parts and electronics firms seek a “back door” into the U.S., according to Rhodium Group.


“The main task for the Mexican government is to convince the U.S. that Mexico is part of the solution for competing with China,” Ramos observes. 


What’s nearly certain is that Trump will keep [potential investors](https://www.barrons.com/articles/election-mexico-trump-kamala-trade-immigration-china-tariffs-dbbb2c69?mod=Searchresults&mod=article_inline)  in Mexico guessing, and their pens away from their checkbooks, for the next two years. Meanwhile, Sheinbaum seems to feel little urgency about improving the domestic business environment. “Mexico was a dream story for a few years because politics didn’t matter,” says Malcolm Dorson, head of emerging markets strategy at Global X ETFs. “Now, politics is everything.”


That is keeping him neutral on Mexican stocks, despite increasingly attractive valuations. Average price/earnings ratios, at 10.5, are on a par with China’s, while return on equity is 16% to 17% compared with China’s 11%, he says. 


Sergey Goncharov, head of Americas fixed income at Vontobel Asset Management, is similarly restrained, despite real interest rates above 5% and the central bank signaling more cuts to come. “Current bond prices reflect a fair assessment of risk,” he says. “Mexico needs a volatility premium.”

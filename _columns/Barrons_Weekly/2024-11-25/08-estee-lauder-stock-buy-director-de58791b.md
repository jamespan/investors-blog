Estée Lauder director Paul J. Fribourg just bought 157,000 shares of the beauty company on the open market.






After an earnings disappointment drove
[Estée Lauder](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/EL)
stock to an 11-year low, one director bought a large block of shares of the beauty company.


Estée Lauder shares have been sliding nearly all of 2024 on continued worries of
[soft sales in Asia](https://www.barrons.com/articles/estee-lauder-earnings-stock-price-57ee2758?mod=article_inline)
, and
[China in particular](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/estee-lauders-slow-progress-on-china-turnaround-a-key-concern-for-analysts-6b277a93)
. As the stock continued dropping, both the

and CEO
[were replaced](https://www.wsj.com/business/estee-lauder-picks-insider-as-new-ceo-7b29768f)
. A
[family drama](https://www.wsj.com/business/estee-lauder-heiress-jane-25aab0ae)
also came into play, as the granddaughter of the founder urged some Estée Lauder board members in early September to oust her cousin, the company’s executive chairman.


 The bottom fell out on Halloween, when Estée Lauder reported
[disappointing earnings](https://www.barrons.com/articles/estee-lauder-earnings-stock-price-6f741873?mod=article_inline)
for the September-ended quarter, removed guidance, and slashed its quarterly dividend. Estée Lauder stock dove 21% that day, and continued to fall, setting a low of \$62.29 on Nov. 12; shares hadn’t traded at that level since April 2013.


From Nov. 13 through Nov. 19, director Paul J. Fribourg
[bought 387,800 Estée Lauder shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000235/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1731706017.xml)
for a total of
[\$24.9 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000239/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1732136641.xml)
, an average of \$64.27 each.


The transactions represent an initial purchase of Estée Lauder shares by Continental Grain, according to a form Fribourg filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Fribourg serves as chairman and CEO of Continental Grain, a privately owned investor in food and agribusiness. He is also a co-trustee and a beneficiary of family trusts that collectively control a majority interest in Continental Grain.


Fribourg owns another 4,000 Estée Lauder shares in a personal account.


Continental Grain didn’t respond to a request to make Fribourg available for comment on the Estée Lauder stock purchase.


This is Fribourg’s first open-market purchase of Estée Lauder stock since he
[joined the board in 2006](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000110465924101259/tm2421000-2_def14a.htm)

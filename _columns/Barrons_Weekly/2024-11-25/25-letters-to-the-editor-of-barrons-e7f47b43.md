**To the Editor:**   
 Tae Kim’s excellent excerpt from his book may turn out to be a  *Barron’s* “cover curse” for Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang, but I long ago embraced the company’s stomach-churning, high-beta valuation, and I can’t wait for  *The Nvidia Way* (“ [How Jensen Huang Built Nvidia Into the \$3 Trillion King of AI](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-nvidia-jensen-huang-98f40bd3?mod=article_inline) ,” Cover Story, Nov. 14).  **Alan Guggenheim

**To the Editor:**   
 Perhaps Nvidia should invent a whiteboard containing a chip that replicates Huang’s thought process. Based on the conversation in the meeting, it could automatically start writing ideas.  **Arthur Shatz

The Bigger Picture for AI
-------------------------

 **To the Editor:**   
 Thanks for going one layer below the most visible companies (“ [The Age of AI Is Still in the Early Innings. These 3 Stocks Will Keep Winning](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-technology-stocks-d289e665?mod=article_inline) ,” Nov. 15). Data centers as a sector will grow and become more like utilities. That will come with changes in power distribution, cooling, supply chains, and other infrastructure needs. Servers, applications, and GPU/CPU technology are just one aspect of the overall enterprise.  **An Jay

No Exit
-------

 **To the Editor:**   
 It’s time to concede that we’re in a classic debt trap (“ [What Killed the Trump Rally? Inflation and Political Uncertainties](https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-killed-the-trump-rally-old-inflation-and-new-political-uncertainties-d1702126?mod=article_inline) ,” Up & Down Wall Street, Nov. 15). Issuing new debt is only compounding the debt that has to be serviced. Since much of government spending is considered untouchable, the only options are default and inflation. The U.S. isn’t going to default, so we’re looking at inflation. Paul Volcker’s solution of raising interest rates to the sky isn’t feasible with our current debt levels. As Jean-Paul Sartre might have said, there’s no exit. As Michael Phelps might say, go for the gold.

Big Business Bias
-----------------

 **To the Editor:**   
 Jay Ezrielev’s essay “ [Trump’s Election Flips the Script on Antitrust](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-antitrust-lina-khan-ftc-90a9d1f9?refsec=other-voices&mod=topics_other-voices&mod=article_inline) ” (Other Voices, Nov. 15) betrays his big-business bias. He claims that antitrust enforcement shouldn’t pursue broad policy goals such as “protecting democratic institutions, preserving liberty, and combating social and economic ills.” Our record income inequality, worst in the developed world, was caused by the rise of dominant corporations and the politicization of economics into supply-side theories that deregulated whole markets and created cartels to facilitate the massive transfer of wealth from wage earners to owners, concentrating wealth in fewer hands, which has caused much less competition, lessened social mobility, and the horrendous health outcomes that Americans experience today.

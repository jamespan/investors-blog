Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at an event in Taipei, Taiwan, in June.











 [Nvidia](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/nvda?mod=article_chiclet) ’s earnings were supposed to be the stock market’s big catalyst this past week— [and they were](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-stock-price-after-earnings-7266d3a7?mod=article_inline) , just not the way anybody thought they would be.


Investors expected big things from Nvidia, or at least big swings. The options market had priced an 8.6% move, up or down, into the stock ahead of its Wednesday earnings release, relatively in line with the reaction following the past four releases. Instead, the stock barely budged, gaining 0.5% on Thursday and finishing the week up less than 1%. The muted trading carried over to the rest of Big Tech, with the 
[Roundhill Magnificent Seven](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/funds/mags?mod=article_chiclet) exchange-traded fund gaining just 0.9%.


 The stock market, however, didn’t need Nvidia to provide the pop. The 
[S&P 500 index](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet), the 
[Nasdaq Composite](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/indexes/comp?mod=article_chiclet), and the 
[Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/indexes/djia?mod=article_chiclet) each rose 1.5%, but even those gains obscure just how strong the stock market was. The 
[Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/funds/rsp?mod=article_chiclet) ETF gained 2.3% as 425 of the index’s stocks finished higher on the week, while the small-cap 
[Russell 2000 index](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/indexes/rut?mod=article_chiclet) gained 3.3%.


The lack of follow-through from Nvidia should be worrisome. Chip makers have been vital for the S&P 500’s performance, so if the still-rapid growth of artificial intelligence isn’t pushing the market higher right now, something else will have to do it. Some investors see Nvidia’s double-digit gain this year, and balk at its current valuation: It trades at 32.2 times 12-month forward earnings, up from 24 at the start of the year. As profitable as the company has been, the stock’s gain this year has been driven by multiple expansion, not earnings. “We are 100% not a buyer of this stock,” says Great Hill Capital’s Tom Hayes.


Thankfully, there were plenty of other stocks to buy. [Gap](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gap) [surged 9.8%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gap-earnings-stock-price-829d933b?mod=article_inline) after reporting better than expected earnings, while [Deere](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/de?mod=article_chiclet) jumped 11% on hopes that it has reached a trough in margins. [IBM](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/ibm?mod=article_chiclet) , [CVS Health](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/cvs?mod=article_chiclet) , and [Walmart](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/wmt?mod=article_chiclet) were among the S&P 500 companies that gained 7% or more. “The ‘beat and hold’ we expected mostly played out,” writes Citigroup strategist Scott Chronert. “Earnings broadening continues to unfold, albeit with some push-out in cyclical sector expectations.”


Still, the broadening market can’t hide just how expensive stocks have become. The S&P 500 trades at 22.1 times 12-month forward earnings for the coming 12 months, the highest since 2020, when it hit 22.9 times. To see multiples meaningfully higher than that, one has to go back to the dot-com era, when the index traded at more than 25 times earnings. “It’s very hard for us to justify a higher near-term multiple,” says Wells Fargo’s head of equity strategy, Chris Harvey. 


Which may be one reason the market has started to [look beyond the Magnificent Seven](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-112024/card/the-mag-7-will-outperform-in-2025-but-not-by-much-goldman-says-rwTJkfArpGJYza1Yku4Z?mod=article_inline) . The Equal Weight ETF trades at just 17.6 times earnings after peaking at nearly 22 times in 2020, while the S&P Small Cap 600, which excludes unprofitable companies, trades at 16.7 times. Earlier this month, Leuthold Group Chief Investment Officer Doug Ramsey noted that the small-cap index could return 10% to 11% annually over the next five years based on current valuations. “For those who believe long-term valuation relationships are still relevant, we recommend moving down the capitalization spectrum,” he writes.


At least until Nvidia’s stock can get going again.

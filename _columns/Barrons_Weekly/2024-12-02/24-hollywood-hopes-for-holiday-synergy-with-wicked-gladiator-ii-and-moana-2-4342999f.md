Two heavily marketed movies,
*Wicked*
and
*Gladiator II*
, went head-to-head on the preholiday opening weekend, taking in nearly \$170 million in domestic box office, according to
[Comscore](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/scor?mod=article_chiclet)
estimates, and \$270 million globally.


*Wicked*
is part one of the Broadway musical (and 1995 novel) of the same name, derived from the 1939 movie
*The Wizard of Oz,*
starring Judy Garland and based on L. Frank Baum’s 1900 novel
*The Wonderful Wizard of Oz*
.
*Gladiator II*
is a sequel to
*Gladiator*
, the 2000 slugfest-in-the-Colosseum.

Universal, led with domestic sales of \$114 million, while
[Paramount](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/para?mod=article_chiclet)
’s
*Gladiator II* 
sold \$55.5 million;
*Wicked* 
won global weekend sales with \$164 million. For its part,
*Gladiator II*
set a record for the biggest domestic November opening of an R-rated film, notes Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian.

Hollywood has struggled to recover from last year’s actors’ and writers’ strikes, and studios were hoping for a repeat of 2023’s “Barbenheimer,” when moviegoers flocked to both
*Barbie* 
and
*Oppenheimer*
. So far this year, Comscore says, domestic releases have racked up \$7.3 billion through this past Sunday, down 10.7% from the same time in 2023.


Not to be outdone,
[Walt Disney](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/dis?mod=article_chiclet) 
jumped into the mix on Wednesday with the animated
*Moana 2*
, a sequel to the 2016 hit. Industry estimates suggest the Polynesian princess could give
*Wicked*
and
*Gladiator II*
a run for their money.

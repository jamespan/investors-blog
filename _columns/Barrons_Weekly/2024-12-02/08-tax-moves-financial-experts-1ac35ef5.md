With the imminent return to the White House of Donald Trump, the tax outlook is coming into focus. And the nation’s wealthiest taxpayers, who were facing a halving of the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption (currently \$13.6 million) at the end of 2025, may have dodged a bullet. 


Long-term tax-planning strategies will emerge as Republican proposals wend their way through Congress. But there are still plenty of end-of-year tax steps you should take to benefit from the current tax code. From tax-loss harvesting to Roth IRA conversions to using a side hustle for write-offs, wealth management professionals say there are plenty of ways taxpayers can keep more of what they earn.

### Consider a health savings account. Plan for required minimum distributions.

 I’m telling all my clients to please meet with their tax preparer sooner rather than later. The tax preparation industry has been through the gauntlet with technology and other changes, and tax seasons are exhausting.


Maxing out your 401(k) or 403(b), if you have surplus cash available, is going to help your current tax situation. And I think one of the unsung heroes of tax-advantaged accounts is the health savings account. Whether with high-net-worth clients or those who are just starting out, I spend quite a bit of time on health savings accounts, because I find that the general public still doesn’t understand just how many advantages there are. You get the tax break when you fund it, and if you delay spending it, it grows and is distributed tax-free.





Another area I spend quite a bit of time on is required minimum distributions. If someone is in the RMD age range and they’re doing charitable giving, I explain to them the benefit of directly gifting from their IRA. I start putting pressure on clients about mid-November to get that done so their distributions don’t get stuck in the custodian’s backlog.


I like to talk to my clients and their CPAs about their asset allocations. Tax preparers can be hesitant to mention an allocation that’s producing ordinary income. I welcome the conversation. I may be able to move an investment to an exchange-traded fund in order to change the taxable nature of the investment.

### Moving assets out of your taxable estate may still make sense.

 The prevailing sentiment after the election is that a substantial amount of the current tax rules under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will probably be extended or made permanent. There is no guarantee that anything will ever happen in politics, but that seems to be the way the wind is blowing. That has reduced the urgency for folks in the ultrahigh-net-worth space to get estate planning or wealth transfer done, but there’s often still a need to do it. Moving things out of your taxable estate before they increase in value is still good planning. 





Yes, you may have this \$13.6-million-dollar coupon for longer, but all of the things we were talking about before the election, we’re still talking about with clients the week after the election: forming an irrevocable dynasty trust, doing transfers of assets, and so on. Just because you may have more time to take advantage of some of these rules being extended or made permanent doesn’t mean you should wait to think about it.


It’s also important to stay on top of tax law changes. We got some information on election Tuesday, but there’s going to be a lot more coming in the weeks and months ahead as cabinet appointments are made, tax plans come out, and legislative plans come out, so keep abreast. Talk to your advisors regularly.

### Tax-loss harvest, catch up on estimated payments, and make charitable gifts.

 One piece of advice has to do with harvesting capital losses before the end of the year. You want to use your losses to offset your gains in an efficient manner. For example, you can’t use a long-term capital loss to offset a short-term capital gain.


For people with self-employment income, there’s a provision in the code that is helpful if you are short on your estimated tax payments. Assuming you have the income, you can do all of your withholding in the fourth quarter. So, for example, a person might not have made estimated tax payments for the first, second, and third quarters. For the fourth installment, he can withhold enough to cover all four installments, and avoid penalties. A lot of people don’t know that rule exists.


From a planned giving point of view, we tell people who are thinking about making charitable gifts over a number of years to make them all in one year. That way you can get your total deductions over the \$29,000 threshold for itemized deductions. You can even make a big charitable deduction into a donor-advised fund. That way you get your charitable deduction in the year you make that big charitable contribution, but the amount that is distributed to the charities from the donor-advised fund can occur over future years.

### Add excess income to a Roth, not a taxable 401(k) or IRA.

 I’ve read a couple of articles recently about year-end tax planning, and they tell you to contribute to your 401(k) or your IRA to get a tax deduction. But that’s one thing I would not do. Who knows what future tax rates will be, but I believe in math, and with the U.S.’s debt levels, people with large retirement accounts should probably stop adding to their taxable 401(k)s and IRAs. Instead, if they have disposable income, they should have it go to a Roth 401(k) or a Roth IRA.


They tell you you’ll get a tax break [by maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions]. But it isn’t a tax deduction [unless you’re a business owner]; it’s a tax deferral. You’ll cut some taxes when you file this year’s returns—big deal. All you’re doing is adding to the problem later on. 


If family members inherit that account, all of the money in IRAs and 401(k)s has to come out by the end of the tenth year after death. With the stretch IRA, you used to be able to go out 30, 40, or 50 years. That period has been cut down, and all of the growth and accumulation in 401(k)s and IRAs has to come out in a much shorter window. It’s a ticking tax time bomb. To avoid it, you’re better off going into Roth vehicles.

### Develop a side hustle, save Roth conversions for down years in markets.

 I think most people should have some sort of business on the side if they can, because the tax code is made for self-employed people. Having a side hustle, whether it’s officiating sports, or running an eBay business, whatever it is—making money that way allows you to take tax write-offs for things you’d otherwise not be able to, such as your car, computer, payments to children, things along those lines.


I love Roth conversions, but I tend to like doing them when the stock market is down 15% to 20%. Those times are ideal opportunities to give a tax gift to the older version of yourself by selling stocks at depressed prices and then never having to pay taxes on that money again.


Since the Republicans now control the government, it is likely that the estate tax thresholds will remain high at approximately \$14 million per person or \$28 million per couple. People with estates at the \$5 million level would have had to do some serious planning had the Democrats taken control. We have to see what the final plans are, but people with estates around that level can breathe easier for now.


I believe that the state and local tax deduction is going to be back in play next year. So, people could delay making state tax estimates until January of 2026 for their 2025 tax liability. The impact of the tax deduction could offset the interest costs on underpaying an estimated payment.

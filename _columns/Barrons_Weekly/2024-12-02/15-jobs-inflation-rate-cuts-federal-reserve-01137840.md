  Unemployment is ticking up, but slowly, without widespread layoffs. And inflation is proving stubborn on the way to 2%. The wild card: Trump tariffs.

A job and resource fair in Hendersonville, N.C., on Nov. 19.






The data-dependent Federal Reserve finally will get some labor-market data on which it can depend, at least to the extent anyone can depend on government numbers.


New data should shed light on a jobs market that’s been marked by slower hiring but few firings. Confirmation of that cooling trend should provide the Fed with justification for another one-quarter-percentage-point reduction in its federal-funds target rate in December. But the number of additional cuts next year will depend on the evolution of that data.


 This coming Friday will see an employment report for November, which should reverse the distortions in October’s numbers stemming from that month’s hurricanes and strikes. While not as market-moving, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or Jolts, release this coming Tuesday could also provide insight into the labor market. Those reports will be major inputs for decisions at the Dec. 17-18 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.


The tiny 12,000 rise in nonfarm payrolls in October, reflecting a 28,000 outright decline in private-sector payrolls, was clearly due to Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the strike against

.
Overall payrolls are estimated to have rebounded to 190,000 in November, according to Bloomberg’s survey of economists, which would be slightly above the 12-month trend. The previous months’ tallies may also be subject to bigger-than-usual revisions owing to a response rate of only 47.4%, a 33-year low, notes Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan.


The headline unemployment rate could tick up to 4.2% in November’s report, from 4.1%, although that may depend on rounding to just that single decimal place as well as the labor-force participation rate. While still historically low, the jobless rate has crept up by a half-percentage point from its cyclical trough. 


But the uptick in the unemployment rate hasn’t come from any widespread layoffs. That’s evident from the continuing low levels of new claims for unemployment insurance, charted below. The four-week average of 217,000, which smooths out weekly swings, reverses a minor uptick over the summer. “The overall level of claims is still extremely low by historical standards,” note Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics. “You have to go back to the 1960s to find a sustained period of similarly low claims. The labor force was a lot smaller then, too.”






While layoffs are low, the Jolts data show hiring has fallen to levels last seen in 2014 (not counting the Covid contraction), according to J.P. Morgan economists. The most recent data for September showed a 500,000 drop in job openings, to 7.5 million. That meant there were still 1.1 job openings per unemployed person, down from the extraordinary peak of 2-to-1 in 2022. “The result has been that effectively the entire increase in the unemployment rate to date can be attributed to a reduction in job-finding probabilities, with effectively no contribution from increased job losing,” they write in their 2025 outlook report.


Minutes from the Nov. 6-7 FOMC meeting released this past week showed the panel deemed the risks were roughly balanced between the economy cooling too quickly and inflation failing to decline further toward its 2% target. The most recent readings on the Fed’s preferred inflation, or PCE, measure showed less progress on that goal.


On the surface, the PCE index was up 0.2% in October while the core index, which excludes food and energy costs, was 0.3%, both as expected. On a year-over-year basis, the core PCE was up 2.8% in October, up from 2.7% in September. The core PCE also was up at a 2.8% annual rate in the latest three months, from 2.4% in the three months to September, which indicates no slowing in the short-term pace, according to John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economic advisors at Brean Capital.


They further note that the “supercore” services PCE, which also strips out housing, was up 0.4% in October. Fed Chair Jerome Powell had called this
[perhaps the most important guide to future core inflation](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm)
, but it is moving in the wrong direction. Its latest year-over-year increase was 3.5%, versus 3.2% in September.


At the same time, goods prices, which have been cooling, could be boosted by higher tariffs. This past week, President-elect Donald Trump said
[he would hike tariffs](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-pledges-tariffs-on-mexico-canada-and-china-3c62b1f7)
on goods from Canada and Mexico by 25% on his first day in office and those from China by an additional 10%.


The labor market data due this coming week should allow the FOMC to trim its federal-funds target range, currently 4.50% to 4.75%, in mid-December. The fed-funds futures market
[placed a 66.3% probability of this](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)
as of Friday morning, according to the CME FedWatch tool.


But the market is pricing in only two more quarter-point trims for 2025, given the healthy jobs market implied by low unemployment claims, still-sticky inflation, and uncertainty over the new administration’s policies. That compares to four cuts by the end of 2025 envisioned by FOMC’s most recent
[Summary of Economic Projections from its September meeting](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20240918.htm)
.


The economic data will likely dictate fewer Fed rate reductions ahead for an economy with a still-healthy labor market and inflation remaining above target.

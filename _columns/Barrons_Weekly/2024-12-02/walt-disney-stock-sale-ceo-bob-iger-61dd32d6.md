 stock has been having a strong year, and CEO Bob Iger just followed through on a plan to sell a large block of stock.


Disney stock has gained more than 25% this year. [Earnings have been strong](https://www.barrons.com/articles/walt-disney-earnings-stock-price-a50f6295?mod=article_inline), and a second consecutive quarter of [profitable streaming](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/disney-dis-q4-earnings-report-2024-b50220c3) has bolstered shares.


Disney [disclosed in mid-November](https://www.barrons.com/articles/walt-disney-stock-sale-ceo-bob-iger-ea21a9ed?mod=article_inline) that Iger had adopted a so-called Rule 10b5-1 plan to sell as many as 372,412 shares after using vested stock options to acquire the stock. 


 Company insiders adopt such plans to remove the appearance of bias from the knowledge of nonpublic information. The plans execute transactions automatically when preset conditions such as price, volume, and timing are met. Iger’s plan had been set to expire on Dec. 17.


Iger’s plan acquired 372,412 Walt Disney shares from options for $34.3 million, an exercise price of $92.24 each, according to [a form that he filed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1207394/000174448924000284/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1732323239.xml) with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His plan then sold the shares the same day for $42.7 million, an average price of $114.57 each.

Iger now owns 226,770 Disney shares in a personal account, plus 20,724 shares through a 401(k) plan. The options his plan used to acquire stock were set to expire on Dec. 18.


Disney declined to comment, and also declined to comment on Iger’s behalf, regarding his plan’s options exercise and stock sale.


This is Iger’s first Disney stock sale as an insider since he returned to head the company in [November 2022](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/leaders/robert-a-iger/).

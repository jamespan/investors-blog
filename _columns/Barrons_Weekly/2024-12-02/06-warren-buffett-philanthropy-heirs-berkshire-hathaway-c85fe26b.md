The most difficult job in the history of philanthropy will land in the lap of Warren Buffett’s three children after his death—and

won’t be untouched.


Buffett, 94, has accumulated a fortune of nearly \$150 billion, almost entirely in
[Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/BRK.A)
stock, and he has charged his three children with donating that money through a finite charitable trust upon his death.


 When the clock starts is an open question. The longtime Berkshire CEO could live another five years or more, and he is giving away about 5% of his Berkshire holdings annually through a giving plan adopted in 2006 that has resulted in the donation of \$55 billion in Berkshire stock.


But his philanthropic goal faces numerous challenges. No foundation has given away \$150 billion—let alone in a period of what could be as short as 10 to 20 years. At that amount, the Buffett Foundation would be the second-largest in the world, behind only the Danish Novo Nordisk Foundation, financed with stock in the Ozempic maker. It would be double the size of the \$75 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.


It’s unclear how much the Buffett children plan to give away each year, but it could approach \$10 billion—more than the \$7.7 billion the Gates Foundation disbursed in 2023. Buffett supplies about half of the funds for the Gates Foundation’s yearly donations, but his gifts, which have totaled more than \$40 billion since 2006, will end upon his death. 






A year ago, Buffett wrote that he anticipated the charitable trust would liquidate in “a decade or so.” But in a new letter to Berkshire shareholders earlier this week, Buffett wrote that the money would be given away “gradually” without specifying a time frame. 


He seemed to imply that his original goal could be unfeasible, and acknowledged that his three children—Howard, Peter, and Susan Buffett, who are now 66 to 71—might not live long enough to finish the job. Successors to each of them, whom he didn’t name, may have to complete the task.


The charitable trust could get less than \$150 billion in Berkshire stock upon Buffett’s death because he’s giving away about 5% of his holdings each year. But Berkshire stock has been appreciating at a faster clip than 5% a year and may continue to do so after Buffett’s death. That could prolong the job that his children will face. Berkshire is now valued at over \$1 trillion, with its stock hitting a new high earlier this past week.


“Giving away money at that pace will not be easy,” says Amir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University. 


Pasic expects the three children to take risks—as their father wants—and not follow what he calls the “professionally managed, expert-driven” approach taken by the many big philanthropies, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has a staff of 2,000.





Buffett likes things lean—he hates bureaucracy and runs Berkshire with a headquarters staff of under 30—and it’s a trait that runs in the family. All three Buffett children operate their own thinly staffed philanthropies, funded by annual donations from their father, each with just 20 to 30 people. They may follow the approach of Mackenzie Scott, who has given away billions of dollars without much of a staff since her divorce from

 founder Jeff Bezos in 2019.
But giving away \$150 billion is a huge task—especially for three siblings who could be in their early to mid-70s when they start the job. None of them has given away anything close to the amount of money they will be charged with after their father’s death, though, to be fair, no one has. The donations from their three philanthropies last year totaled less than \$1 billion, perhaps 10% of what they may try to give away each year after their father’s death. 


They’ve each pursued different paths. Howard Buffett, 69, an Illinois corn and soybean farmer, has become one of the largest private donors to Ukraine, which he has called “the greatest humanitarian crisis” in his lifetime. He donated over \$350 million to Ukraine last year and was personally recognized by Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, as one of the country’s great international benefactors and champions.


Peter Buffett, 66, is a composer who has been influenced by Native American culture and lives near Kingston, N.Y. His

 Foundation has focused in recent years on that area, where he purchased a 1,600-acre farm that he uses as a sustainable agriculture model. Kingston is about 100 miles north of New York City on the Hudson River. 
Susan Buffett, 71, lives in Omaha like her father and runs the Sherwood Foundation. Her giving has been concentrated in Nebraska, with a focus on childhood development and young women.


Susan Buffett is also chairman of the Susan T. Buffett Foundation, named after Warren’s first wife, who died in 2004. That organization, run by Susan’s ex-husband, Allen Greenberg, is one of the largest funders of reproductive rights and pro-choice organizations, including Planned Parenthood.  


The three kids’ foundations each are funded by annual contributions of Berkshire stock from their father that are worth about \$400 million. Buffett wants his annual contributions to be donated and not banked. At about \$1 billion annually, the Susan T. Buffett Foundation gets more, though it’s unclear what its role will be after Buffett’s death. 






Buffett’s charitable trust—and, therefore, his children—could be an influential force at Berkshire for years after his death. He now holds a 14% stake in Berkshire, but his voting interest is about double that amount because his holding consists almost entirely of supervoting Class A shares. That interest will probably decline gradually over the coming years and ultimately will be too small to matter. 


Two of Buffett’s children, Howard and Susan, are already on Berkshire’s board, and Buffett has written that Howard will probably become nonexecutive chairman after his death. The trust will amplify their power.


After Buffett’s death, Berkshire will face some key decisions. The children may have a say in whether the company pays a dividend—it doesn’t pay one now—and whether businesses should be sold to make the sprawling company more focused.


Some Berkshire investors may welcome the involvement of Buffett’s kids in keeping the company together. They could help fend off activists who would break it up, and maintain the Berkshire culture of decentralization and accountability that Buffett fostered. 


But there is also a risk that their views will come into conflict with Buffett’s management successors, who are expected to be led by Greg Abel, a veteran Berkshire executive who runs the company’s sprawling noninsurance operations, including the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a diversified utility. Abel is likely to become CEO.


One of the challenges faced by the Buffett kids is that their decisions for the Buffett charitable trust will need to be unanimous. Buffett wrote in his letter this past week that some wealthy friends told him that his stipulation for unanimity among the three children wouldn’t be workable. A concern is that such a rule could even paralyze the organization. Buffett, though, said that the rule would give them an easy way to fend off “earnest requests from very sincere friends” and from becoming “targets of opportunity” by allowing an individual child to say that isn’t something my siblings would approve. 


Still, there’s a question of how the money will be donated. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in June, Susan Buffett said she and her siblings hadn’t discussed the topic. “We have not talked about what we will do because it seems a little premature,” she said. “I can imagine it will probably be some continuation of what we’ve been doing.” The three children didn’t respond to interview requests from

Howard Buffett’s passion, Ukraine, could absorb billions in donations, as the country could be in a position to rebuild after a potential end to the war with Russia in several years. But a limited amount of money can flow into Kingston, Peter Buffett’s focus, given a population of less than 25,000. It’s estimated that he already has plowed about \$250 million into the Kingston area.


Both Susan and Peter Buffett lean progressive and are oriented toward what they view as social justice. Peter, for instance, writes in NoVo’s mission statement that the foundation has operated “at the margins….Supporting the spirit and agency of girls and women (specifically Black, Brown and Indigenous) everywhere was a clear way to rebalance an intensely patriarchal global culture.”


Susan Buffett, who has donated to Democratic political candidates, including Hillary Clinton, writes in Sherwood’s mission statement that its goal is “to double down on our values of equity, social justice, and shared humanity by making grants in Nebraska to organizations with missions we love and people we trust.”


Indiana University’s Pasic says donations can provide psychic benefits to givers over several generations and financial benefits to recipients. He cites the Rockefeller Foundation as an example. “Philanthropy of this magnitude is really about families,” he says. “It can create harmonious relationships within families.” 


While Warren Buffett’s giving philosophy involves family, he doesn’t want a multigenerational approach or “dynastic wealth.” He wrote this past week that the unnamed successors for his three children “are somewhat younger than my children,” which suggests that Buffett’s grandchildren aren’t in the mix.


Still, Buffett expressed hope that “Susie, Howie, and Peter themselves will disburse all of my assets.” That may be optimistic, given the huge sum involved. But the Buffett charitable trust promises to be a huge force in philanthropy—barring a collapse in Berkshire stock—for a decade or two after Buffett’s death.


And for Berkshire shareholders.

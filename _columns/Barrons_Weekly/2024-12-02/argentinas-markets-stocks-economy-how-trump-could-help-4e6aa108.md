Javier Milei has done the hard part. 


Now comes the even harder part. Investors are hitting pause on an epic rally in [Argentine bonds](https://www.barrons.com/articles/argentinas-bonds-climb-on-presidents-reforms-3aaeb24f?mod=Searchresults&mod=article_inline) while the fiery libertarian president turns to his next challenges. 


“It looks like the bonds are fairly valued now,” says Mauro Roca, who covers Latin American sovereigns at fixed-income investor TCW. 


 Since taking office last December, Milei has applied his [metaphorical chain saw to Argentina’s bloated budget](https://www.barrons.com/articles/argentina-is-taking-a-chain-saw-to-its-economy-investors-love-it-448487ac?mod=Searchresults&mod=article_inline), shredding pensions, subsidies, and regional transfers enough to shrink inflation from 25% monthly to less than 3%. He has replenished the treasury sufficiently to service $9 billion in loan payments next year, markets are betting. And he has done it all while maintaining broad popular support. 


“No one thought those kind of cuts in public spending were survivable,” says Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America Program at the Wilson Center.

Markets are banking on Milei being further bolstered by warm relations with President-elect Donald Trump. Milei was the first foreign leader welcomed at Mar-a-Lago after the U.S. election, where Trump expressed confidence that his visitor would make Argentina great again. 


All of that has propelled prices of Argentina’s Eurobonds from about 25 cents on the dollar when Milei was elected to 65 cents now. The

Milei’s second year in power will require more finesse and less brute force. His next macroeconomic hurdle is ditching currency controls, which depress Argentina’s mostly agricultural exports with an overvalued peso, and generally create a minefield for commerce and investment. “The overvalued currency is a trap the government has got itself into,” Roca says.

But cutting the currency cord conflicts with the political imperative of winning midterm elections next October, or at least doing well enough that a revived Peronist opposition doesn’t turn Milei into a lame duck. Letting the peso float would mean further devaluation, undermining Milei’s signature achievement of (relatively) taming inflation. 


“The midterms are a pretty binary event,” says Trevor Yates, an analyst covering Argentina at Global X ETFs. “Milei could go the way of Macri if he loses support.” The market-oriented reforms of Mauricio Macri, Milei’s predecessor in 2015-19, failed despite $44 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund. 


Investors are betting Milei will focus on the elections and let currency reform wait.

Expectations of a Trump bump for Argentina are also “extraordinarily exaggerated,” Gedan says. They rest on the tenuous notion that Trump, as leader of the IMF’s largest shareholder, can pressure the multilateral into extending more credit to the country that has already absorbed 30% of its loanable capital. “The IMF will be very hesitant to offer fresh capital,” Gedan predicts.


Argentina is hardly priced for an economic miracle, despite the lucrative run-up in its bonds. Credit at 65% of par reflects expectations that the country will have to restructure its debt in 2026, says Kate Moreton, an analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “The question is how friendly the restructuring will be,” she adds. 


Milei’s chain-saw reform could yet unleash the miracle. Argentina’s farmers could export much more with modernized rail and port infrastructure, Gedan says. The country has 50% more lithium in the ground than its neighbor Chile. The Vaca Muerta petroleum deposit holds the world’s second-biggest reserves of shale gas. 


Exploiting these riches requires a stable environment that the intrepid president is halfway to achieving, at best. Investors should stay tuned, but cautious. B

Over the past 15 years, oil drillers turned a stretch of desert in Texas and New Mexico called the Permian Basin into the most important oil basin in the world by re-engineering pipes and applying pressure and chemistry. Now they’re tapping a new technology to keep the crude flowing for decades more: artificial intelligence.


 AI can feel like an unnecessary gadget in some industries—a chatbot to improve emails or spiff up spreadsheets. Not in energy. One expert thinks it can help companies extract so much more oil that it’s equivalent to adding the output of an entire Middle Eastern nation. “It’s like getting a Kuwait on-line,” said Rakesh Jaggi, who leads the digital business at

,
the world’s largest oil-services company.


Oil companies are on a relentless quest to produce more oil at lower costs, and AI is boosting that effort. Their success has already been remarkable. Over the past decade, the U.S. pumped out 60% more oil a day with 40% fewer workers. The industry’s annual productivity gains in that stretch outpaced even those of online retailers, and are roughly seven times as large as those of the average U.S. business. By extracting more oil while reducing capital expenses and manpower, they’re lowering the costs at which they can drill profitably. In the Permian, the “break-even” price for oil producers has fallen to \$40 a barrel from over \$90 in 2012, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. AI should take that number even lower, boosting oil company margins and cash flow.

—all of the extra cash they’re generating through efficiency gains should keep their dividends secure and growing, even during oil price slumps. Some of those stocks now yield over 4%.


AI and oil might seem like a strange pairing. The sterile data centers that power AI programs have little in common with the grimy pipes and valves that pump crude. But oil drilling is a digital enterprise as much as a mechanical one today. Fields are seeded with sensors gathering reams of information about pressure, heat, radiation, and rock lithology. The action happening at the wells, tanks, and compressors is displayed on a screen hundreds of miles away—and it’s often being controlled from there, too.


At Chevron’s remote operations center in Midland, Texas, a couple dozen workers control thousands of pieces of equipment spread throughout the Permian. They each sit at workstations with 15 or so computer screens covered in blinking lines of data, interspersed with images of the fields captured by drones or still cameras. The technicians can remotely adjust the equipment themselves or direct people in the field to do it. Some equipment is even controlled autonomously by computers, using software that can detect pressure changes and adjust valves in real time. SLB says it has begun to deploy automated drilling operations, as well, making one of the most complex and stress-inducing portions of the process akin to riding in a robo-taxi. “You can sit back—not with a glass of Champagne, but maybe with a glass of juice,” Jaggi said.

As a result, oil country is quieter than it used to be. On a recent tour of Chevron’s wells in a New Mexico section of the Permian, the only sounds were the desert wind and the dishwasher-like whoosh of oil rushing through pipes. In some stretches of this area, you’re as likely to see a rattlesnake or a roadrunner as a human. 


The drilling process is also less explosive. The same companies pumping dirty, combustible fuels would rather operate their machines with clean and predictable electrons. Smoke-belching diesel rigs are being replaced by electric ones, allowing producers to better control the amount of energy they’re using. Chevron operates its own electric substation in New Mexico, which is powered primarily by a solar field.


In the past, workers had to race to the site of problems to turn off equipment. Today, software does some of those jobs. A program designed by Chevron automatically detects methane leaks and shuts them down without human intervention. It has cut methane-flaring, a potent and costly source of greenhouse-gas emissions, by 60%, the company says. 


Tech advances ramped up in the past year or so. Chevron has been experimenting with artificial intelligence for years, but the company sped up its efforts last June as it became clear that the use cases were growing. “We began to see the future is essentially now,” said Steve Bowman, who leads a team of about 20 people focused on employing AI, particularly in the Permian region. Chevron built customized AI software using tools from

,
including its Azure cloud platform.


Exxon has similarly begun to embrace AI after some initial caution. “We don’t like jumping on bandwagons,” said Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods on an earnings call last month. But he’s increasingly convinced that “AI is part of the equation” for Exxon’s future growth.


The Permian, which covers 75,000 square miles and accounts for nearly half of U.S. oil production, offers an excellent testing ground for AI. Drilling there is complicated, and better technology can make a noticeable difference. Unlike conventional wells where the oil is held in vast reservoirs, Permian oil is stuck in shale rock formations and has to be blasted out using water and sand. The hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, process involves drilling more than a mile down and several miles across through a wide range of rock types. Pressure in the wells declines quickly, causing production to fall as much as 70% in the first year.


Knowing where to frack can be an enormous advantage. The AI tools that Chevron has developed can predict which sections of the subsurface will yield the most oil, and which rock types will prove tricky to drill. Historically, oil companies have pulled out only about 10% of the recoverable oil in the sections of the Permian where they drill, a fraction of the recovery rate for conventional wells. Getting above that 10% level is considered the “holy grail” of Permian drilling, says Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer at investment and advisory firm Pickering Energy Partners. Bowman thinks the holy grail is now in sight. “It’s a good opportunity for AI,” he said.










Modern advances in oil production don’t line up with “Drill, baby, drill,” the rallying cry of President-elect Donald Trump. Fifteen years ago, the early Permian shale producers used that kind of brute-force method. They raced to lease and drill land, burning through almost \$400 billion in cash, scaring off investors and sinking the stocks. It’s one reason that oil stocks are still unloved today, making up less than 4% of the total

 market cap. 
Today, growth in the oilfield is happening much differently. It’s more like the semiconductor industry, whose efficiency gains allow chips to process exponentially more information than they did a decade ago. Oil production from the Permian tripled in the past decade to more than six million barrels a day, even as the number of rigs fell by 46%. The key has been smarter drilling, not more of it. Producers are drilling much longer and more sophisticated horizontal wells, finding richer shale-oil deposits at progressively lower costs. Chevron can drill 80% more feet a day than it did just five years ago.


These innovations aren’t merely boosting the bottom lines of producers. They’re the biggest reason that daily U.S. oil production has grown from 5.1 million barrels in 2007 to 13.4 million today.





“It’s frankly changed who we are as a country,” said Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne. “It even changed the value of the dollar.” In 2007, the U.S. imported so much oil that it accounted for a third of the trade deficit, causing dollars to leave the country and depreciate the currency. Oil and oil products are now far and away America’s top exports, and the country no longer has a petroleum trade deficit. The U.S. produces more oil than any other country by far, pumping out nearly 50% more than Saudi Arabia.


The efficiency gains and production growth are set to continue. Permian producer Diamondback Energy said it can maintain or even grow production next year with 18 rigs, down from prior expectations for 22 to 24. 


It isn’t easy to pinpoint how much of the advancements that oil companies have made is from AI. Oil-and-gas companies are on track to spend \$3.1 billion on AI this year—less than 5% of their capital expenditures—but annual AI spending could rise 80% in the next five years, according to market research firm Mordor Intelligence. SLB is seeing a surge in interest in these tech tools, and expects to surpass \$3 billion in revenue from its digital division next year, up from \$1.5 billion in 2021, Jaggi said. Its digital services include helping producers adopt AI.


Some of the most impressive gains are happening in offshore oil drilling. To find oil underwater, producers use seismic imaging, which involves shooting compressed air into the water, and using sensors placed on the sea floor or tugged behind boats to evaluate the acoustic waves that are sent back. Evaluating the images is a time-consuming and inexact science. Jaggi of SLB said that the time lag between doing seismic exploration and determining where to drill used to be about a year and half. AI has changed that dramatically.


“We’ve gone from 18 months to 18 days,” he said. “From the time you shoot a seismic until the time you can plan a well in a place like the Gulf of Mexico is now measured in days.”


Seismic imaging is almost like taking an ultrasound of the rock beneath the waves. Analyzing it is akin to a radiologist seeking clues in an ultrasound or X-ray—a process that is itself being transformed by AI. But exploring underwater is much more laborious than analyzing the human body. Oil companies sometimes take seismic images of hundreds of square miles of rock, accumulating terabytes worth of data to analyze. To harness all of that information, they’re working with some unusual partners. One leader in the field is Houston-based Bluware, whose software uses concepts from the videogame industry, and is backed by the venture capital arm of oil major

.



Bluware says it saved an oil company \$170 million when its software identified a geologic fault at an offshore location where a company had planned to drill a well. AI also recently led to a major deepwater oil discovery, said Judson Jacobs, who leads a group that researches and consults with producers on oil-production technology at S&P Global Commodity Insights. They weren’t willing to identify the oil companies involved, for competitive reasons.


Eventually, that mysterious find in the ocean’s depths could take a place in the history of oil. Rusty horse-drawn tank wagons at the Drake Well Museum in Titusville, Pa., mark the start of the oil age in 1859. The new age might be represented by an object much more mundane, but infinitely more powerful—say, a hard drive or a seismic image. Just don’t expect anyone to talk about it for a while. Even as AI reveals secrets hidden underground, the oil companies using it aren’t quite ready to reveal theirs.

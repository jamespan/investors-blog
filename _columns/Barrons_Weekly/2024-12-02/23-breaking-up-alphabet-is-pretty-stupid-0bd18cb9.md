**To the Editor:**   
 Regarding “ [Google Will Survive AI and Breakup Calls. Why Alphabet Stock Could Gain 50%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-google-alphabet-stock-price-ai-doj-break-up-calls-3ea5d918?mod=article_inline) ” (Cover Story, Nov. 22): If artificial-intelligence development and global leadership are truly a national security focus, breaking up Alphabet, forcing it to share its data publicly, or limiting its ability to further develop AI internally seems pretty stupid. I’d bet that this case gets settled with a big fine and limits on payments for placement under the new administration.

The U.S. Isn’t a Casino
-----------------------

 **To the Editor:**   
 Randall W. Forsyth’s Up & Down Wall Street column (“ [Trump’s Tariffs Could Damage the Dollar. It’s a Steep Price to Pay](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trumps-tariffs-damage-dollar-inflation-23609ee2?mod=article_inline) ,” Nov. 22) and Megan Leonhardt’s interview with New York Fed President John Williams (“ [Fed’s Williams Sees Inflation Cooling and Interest Rates Falling Further](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-williams-inflation-interest-rates-ad56c96d?mod=article_inline) ,” Nov. 21) should be mandatory reading for the 70% of [*Barron’s* Big Money poll](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stocks-market-prediction-big-money-poll-5ffbe89b?mod=article_inline) respondents who declared that Donald Trump’s tariff- and deportation-based economic plan would be better for the economy and the market than that of Vice President Kamala Harris. Both articles eloquently illustrate the likely deleterious effects of Trump’s misguided approach to the economy. The U.S. isn’t a casino whose owner can stiff people to whom it owes money, notably Social Security recipients and bondholders, and then declare bankruptcy and stiff creditors.

‘Hands Off My Medicare’
-----------------------

 **To the Editor:**   
 Elizabeth O’Brien’s article “ [Trump Wants to Shake Up Healthcare. What It Means for Your Insurance](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-healthcare-insurance-medicare-00b41a15?mod=article_inline) ” (Retirement, Nov. 21) notes a likely push by the incoming Trump administration away from Medicare to Medicare Advantage plans. This reminds me of the old mantra “Get your damn government hands off my Medicare” by Republicans when President Barack Obama was lobbying for the Affordable Care Act.


How the tables have turned.

Disinflation Is a Maybe
-----------------------

 **To the Editor:**   
 Jim Paulsen’s suggestion in “ [Disinflation Could Be the Most Important Investment Event of 2025, Says This Strategist](https://www.barrons.com/articles/disinflation-economy-markets-gold-energy-stocks-ddf58018?mod=article_inline) ,” Market View, Nov. 22) is cogent, but he doesn’t mention Trump’s possible disempowerment of the Internal Revenue Service, his tariff plans, or his general unwillingness to approach a balanced budget.


As we embark on some version of the world’s largest experiment in modern monetary theory, it will be interesting to see whether we can remain the best house on a bad block of fiat money printers. 


Disinflation is a maybe.

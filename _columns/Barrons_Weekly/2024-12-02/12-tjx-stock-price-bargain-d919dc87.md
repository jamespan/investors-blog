TJX stock has been a winner—and should stay that way.






[Retail earnings season](https://www.barrons.com/articles/retail-stock-earnings-what-expect-5b52620b?mod=article_inline)
is nearly over—and

Cos. looks like a clear winner.


It didn’t appear that way at first. Shares of TJX, the largest off-price retailer, went nowhere after it
[reported results](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tjx-earnings-stock-price-8b70b8cf?refsec=retail&mod=topics_retail&mod=article_inline)
on Nov. 20: Although its fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of \$1.14 and revenue growth of 6%, to \$14.06 billion beat analysts’ expectations, the company’s conservative guidance for the key holiday quarter garnered more attention. By contrast, peer

’ upbeat fourth-quarter outlook overshadowed a lackluster quarter, helping that stock gain 2.2%.


 Yet the stock, unsurprisingly, soon recovered—it’s up 4.6% since—as TJX is often cautious with its fourth-quarter guidance. There was also plenty of good news to focus on in the quarter: Gross margins expanded, revenue was higher across all its brands, which include T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods, and same-store sales grew by 3%.


In fact, those comps “once again [led] the pack” and were better than every other retailer save

notes Gimme Credit Senior Analyst Carol Levenson on Monday.


Even more impressive to her, however, is how TJX continues to win even when other retailers can’t seem to get the formula right.

shares had their worst day in years after the big box store’s largely discretionary merchandise

. Department stores, too, have had difficulty selling home goods, but TJX shoppers didn’t seem to get the memo. And while bricks-and-mortar retailers have been scrambling to get ahead of e-commerce for years, TJX has virtually no online presence, and still keeps winning.


“Investors have been hearing from retailers for two years that a cautious customer was pulling back on the purchase of discretionary items in favor of essentials,” writes Levenson. “TJX flouts this trend; it sells nothing but discretionary items, primarily apparel and home fashions. Yet aside from the pandemic, when it was forced to close its stores, it has grown sales in all macro environments.”


TJX is also the only off-price retailer to have any meaningful international presence, a profile that will get a boost thanks to its newly announced plans to open stores in Spain under the TK Maxx name, which it uses overseas to avoid

with the British store T.J. Hughes.





Smaller discounter

will report tomorrow, and the current economic climate would seem to benefit it as much as its bigger siblings TJX and Ross. Yet TJX’s history shows that it’s been the most successful of the bunch when it comes to monetizing consumers’ longstanding hunt for value. It has returned 16%, including reinvested dividends, over the past five years, beating Ross’s 6.3%, and Burlington’s 6.8%


TJX shares have climbed some 60% since

 over the same period. But the recent gains come with a price—at more than 25 times forward earnings, shares have gotten much more expensive. “The largest risk for shares is simply valuation, where investors have been hiding out in off-price,” writes William Blair analyst Dylan Carden. That hasn’t stopped him from staying bullish on the stock, given everything else working in its favor.
When it comes to full-year performance, Levenson expects TJX will “rank again among the top sales performers in retail…. It sticks to its knitting and makes few missteps.”


That should keep shares from unraveling, even in a tricky retail environment.

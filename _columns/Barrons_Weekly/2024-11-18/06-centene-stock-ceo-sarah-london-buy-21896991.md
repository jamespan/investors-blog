CEO Sarah London bought \$250,300 of Centene stock






 [Centene](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/CNC) stock recently traded to a multiyear low, and CEO Sarah London moved to buy a large block of the insurer’s shares.


Centene stock has dropped about 20% in 2024, and set a low of \$59.47 in the past week. It hasn’t traded at the level since April 2021, predating London’s tenure as CEO, which [began March 2022](https://www.centene.com/products-and-services/state-and-national-solutions/medicaid.html) . Centene says it is the largest Medicaid managed care organization, and The Wall Street Journal has noted that another Trump administration [could be](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-will-create-new-winners-and-losers-in-healthcare-55de750f) “bad news” for Medicaid.


 London paid \$250,300 on Nov. 8 for 4,117 Centene shares, an average price of \$60.80 each. She now owns 667,229 shares in a personal account, including unvested restricted stock units and performance stock units, according to [a form she filed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1071739/000107173924000203/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1731107745.xml) with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Centene didn’t respond to a request to make London available for comment.


She last bought Centene stock on the open market in March 2023, when she [paid \$1.9 million for 30,000 shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1071739/000107173923000059/xslF345X03/wf-form4_167908292828260.xml) , an average price of \$62.60 each. No other Centene insiders [bought stock](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=0001071739) between London’s two purchases.

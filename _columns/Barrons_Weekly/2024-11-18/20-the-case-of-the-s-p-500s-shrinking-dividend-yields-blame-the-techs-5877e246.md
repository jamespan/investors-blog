At Friday’s close, the dividend yield on the S&P 500 stood at 1.27%, based on payments made over the past 12 months. Early in the week, the index topped 6000 for the first time, a record.

That is the lowest dividend yield since it hit 1.17% on Feb. 12, 2001. Tech stocks then also accounted for a big chunk of the index. The highest yield for the index since 2001 was 4.1% in March 2009, as stocks sank to their low point during the 2008-09 financial crisis.

Tech stocks led by [Nvidia](/market-data/stocks/nvda?mod=article_chiclet) , [Apple](/market-data/stocks/aapl?mod=article_chiclet) , and [Microsoft](/market-data/stocks/msft?mod=article_chiclet) made up 32% of the S&P 500 on Monday, more than twice the share of financials, the second-largest group, at 14%. Three tech stocks that account for 20% of the index pay tiny dividends: Nvidia yields 0.03%; Apple, 0.5%; and Microsoft 0.8%.

Other tech-oriented giants, such as [Amazon.com](/market-data/stocks/amzn?mod=article_chiclet) , [Alphabet](/market-data/stocks/googl?mod=article_chiclet) , and [Meta Platforms](/market-data/stocks/meta?mod=article_chiclet) , also have little to no yields. Amazon has no dividend; nor do two other top 10 S&P 500 stocks, [Tesla](/market-data/stocks/tsla?mod=article_chiclet) and [Berkshire Hathaway](/market-data/stocks/brk.b?mod=article_chiclet) .

The upshot is that in the S&P 500, at least, there is no meaningful yield for investors to reinvest, which would provide so-called dividend support for the index. The situation isn’t any better with mid-cap stocks, with the S&P MidCap 400 yielding only 1.1%.

(Angus Mordant/Bloomberg)Airline investors should pack their bags. The news of the past couple of weeks promises to send them on a long and profitable trip.

One company, though, looks like it will be left on the tarmac. [Spirit Airlines](/market-data/stocks/save?mod=article_chiclet) said this week that it is looking to restructure its debt, which would [wipe out existing shareholders](https://www.barrons.com/articles/spirit-airlines-stock-bankruptcy-frontier-b43748e1?mod=article_inline) , though it says customers won’t be affected. It’s a significant setback for the industry’s biggest disrupter over the past decade.

Other players could head in the opposite direction. Spirit’s woes—and the election of Donald Trump—should give the rest of the stocks in the industry some of their best tailwinds in years.

Airline stocks have already soared on Trump’s victory, in the hopes that consumer spending will respond to pro-growth policies such as lower taxes. They should also benefit from a change in regulation. Trump is less likely to share the Biden administration’s [concerns about monopoly power](https://www.barrons.com/articles/mergers-acquisitions-bank-stocks-b86bf6f4?mod=article_inline) .

The airline industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of consolidation over the past couple of decades. Fewer players in the industry will mean the existing airlines have more power to push prices higher and build market share on lucrative routes. A spate of airline mergers in the early 2010s gave [Delta Air Lines](/market-data/stocks/dal?mod=article_chiclet) , [United Airlines Holdings](/market-data/stocks/ual?mod=article_chiclet) , and [American Airlines Group](/market-data/stocks/aal?mod=article_chiclet) substantial market power. Delta, United, [JetBlue Airways](/market-data/stocks/jblu?mod=article_chiclet) , and [Southwest Airlines](/market-data/stocks/luv?mod=article_chiclet) more than doubled from late 2012 to late 2014, and American Airlines soared after emerging from bankruptcy in 2013.

Some analysts see those kinds of gains returning.

“This is the best industry setup for the U.S. airlines in a decade,” wrote analyst Conor Cunningham of Melius Research, who argues that the stocks may be poised to double again.

The [NYSE Arca Airline Index](/market-data/indexes/xal?countrycode=xx&mod=article_chiclet) has risen 2.8% since the close on Nov. 5, the day of the election. But that performance is dragged down by Spirit. The airline industry’s most important players are up much more than that. Delta has risen 11%, United is up 14%, and American is up 8%.

Spirit, which accounts for about 4% of U.S. capacity, was undone by regulatory setbacks and business problems. A judge blocked its proposed merger with JetBlue earlier this year after the Justice Department challenged it. A potential merger with [Frontier Group Holdings](/market-data/stocks/ulcc?mod=article_chiclet) has also fallen apart, [according to The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/spirit-airlines-moves-toward-bankruptcy-filing-after-frontier-drops-merger-bid-5d492e80?mod=article_inline) . And some of Spirit’s no-frills pricing innovations have been adopted by competitors, making it harder for it to stand out.

If budget airlines can no longer disrupt the industry, that should allow the other players to have more control over the direction of capacity and prices.

Cunningham now expects the number of available seats on airlines to decline, enhancing their pricing power. Capacity could rise by 3% next year, down from his prior expectation of 6.2%.

Another positive for the industry is that oil prices have been trending downward, and most analysts expect them to fall even more next year. Airline margins typically rise when fuel prices drop.

Despite their strong recent performances, airline stocks still trade at reasonable valuations. Delta trades for 8.9 times its expected 2025 earnings; United is at 7.4 times; and American is at 6.9 times.

Spirit stock might be grounded. The rest of the group looks ready to gain altitude.

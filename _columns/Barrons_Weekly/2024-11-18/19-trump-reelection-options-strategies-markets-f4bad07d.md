Thematic trades on artificial intelligence and other innovations, which have long contributed to stellar investment returns, may be usurped by global investment themes. Wagers on countries and international trends are a harder specialty, and require detailed knowledge of the complex engines that power the world.

A long America/short China trade could emerge, for instance, if Trump’s planned tariffs adversely impact China’s economy and monetary policy and reshuffle the world order.

It’s hard to predict which sectors might outperform during Trump’s administration. Trump’s cabinet secretaries and other key appointees are unburdened with loyalty to insular Washington. They may even harbor hostility. Changes to the tax code, currency markets, [and tariffs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tariffs-who-gets-hurt-mexico-china-d1da2d50?mod=article_inline) , as well as the economic impacts of repatriating illegal migrants and shifts in fiscal and foreign policy, are too vast and complicated to authoritatively discuss before they have been enacted.

Any changes Trump make will occur amid much hand waving and palavering. The mandarins of the financial and government establishment, and the velvet-elbowed pundits who often do their bidding, will go into overdrive in their quest to outdo each other’s sound bites. Be skeptical of what they say.

No one knows what happens if policies that favor American goods and companies change the economic confederations that were created after World War II to stabilize a damaged world. [Dean Acheson](https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB125573798856091245?mod=article_inline) , who created many of those policies, understood statecraft’s complications. He liked making furniture in a wood shop behind his home because the results were immediate, unlike diplomatic work, which took decades or longer to bear fruit.

Unless something changes the national sentiment that propelled Trump’s victory, midterm congressional elections will likely have no material impact.

The usual unknowns loom over markets, but U.S. stocks will probably advance for the next two years. The rally should make the [S&P 500 index](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) an even more popular proxy for Trump’s policies, though the index’s revenue is tilted toward international markets, and that demands further study—and probably some new currency-hedged product to offset that risk.

In the options market, investors must consider what happens to implied volatility, which is the essence [of options trading](https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-to-buy-and-sell-options-without-making-a-fool-of-yourself-51600336811?mod=article_inline) . Options-selling strategies might lose their luster if more money is made buying call and put options as inexpensive proxies for stocks rather than selling them. (Calls give the holder the right to buy an asset at a set price and time, while puts give them the right to sell an asset at a set price and time.)

If conviction runs hot for Trump’s policies, index options and exchange-traded funds could become the preferred way stock investors leverage long trades and cost-effectively increase position sizes.

High-conviction investors often talk about owning, say, 117% of whatever it is they like. This means that they could buy \$1 million of the [SPDR S&P 500](/market-data/funds/spy?mod=article_chiclet) exchange-traded fund (ticker: SPY) and use index options to increase their exposure to \$1,170,000.

So far, our Trump trades have worked out well. On Jan. 31, [we predicted Trump’s re-election](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stocks-move-sharply-after-election-boom-bust-c9e56589?mod=article_inline) and suggested buying SPDR S&P 500 December \$530 call options, which are now profitable. We recently recommended [selling put options](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elections-real-winner-stock-market-fc7de222?mod=article_inline) to buy more SPDR S&P 500 shares, as the stock market was a big election winner. The market has since surged, and options volatility has fallen.

The tectonic plates that support the political world are in motion. Be patient. Remember Anselm Rothschild’s advice when his family was Europe’s indispensable financier: Take things as they are and profit off the folly of the world.

**To the Editor:**   
 Regarding “ [An Open Letter to Mr. Trump](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-election-win-stocks-bonds-economy-b7503579?mod=article_inline) ” (Cover Story, Nov. 8) and Matt Peterson’s contention that “cut[ting] \$2 trillion in federal spending isn’t credible”: Nor were electric cars initially credible at scale, nor a reusable rocket, nor a rocket that can land back on the launchpad, nor a chip in the brain that allows a patient with quadriplegia to play chess on a board.

Evolutionary changes to existing processes by incumbents rarely yield revolutionary results, particularly in government. We need revolutionary improvements in our debt. That’s a reason to have Elon Musk and his team work on this.

### Don’t Dread Inflation

**To the Editor:**   
 Regarding “ [Billionaire Investor on How to Understand Risk and a Trump Presidency](https://www.barrons.com/articles/markets-trump-risk-howard-marks-fd779c8a?mod=article_inline) ” (Up & Down Wall Street, Nov. 8): We live with inflation. We will always live with inflation. It’s a part of living. Any inflation consequences as the result of Trump policy will be navigable. Don’t let them keep you from being hopeful for the future. Stay well invested.

### Retirement Insecurity

**To the Editor:**   
 Kudos to Allan Sloan for exposing shameful profiteering in converting federally guaranteed pensions to annuities with lesser state government protection—nearly \$800 million for his former employer alone (“ [My Pension Became an Annuity. Here’s What I Learned](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pension-annuity-risk-retirement-income-c33b704e?mod=article_inline) ,” Sloan’s View, Nov. 8). Breaking a vital promise to employees—who are essential to a company’s success—by betraying their retirement security to enrich corporate coffers is morally and ethically bankrupt and should be illegal.

### Time to Be Fearful?

**To the Editor:**   
 Andrew Bary correctly points out that the current cash position of Berkshire Hathaway is a record \$311 billion, which is about 31.6% of the stock’s market cap, currently at just over \$1 trillion (“ [Warren Buffett Is Raising Cash—and Missing Out on the Booming Market](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-bank-of-america-stock-fd3ad9fe?mod=article_inline) ,” Nov. 8). But I don’t agree that Buffett is missing out. He is famous for “being fearful when others are greedy.” That time seems now, when several long-term valuation models suggest that U.S. stocks are priced to deliver low-single digit returns in the coming five to 10 years.

The presidential election will be consequential for antitrust policy. Beginning with replacing Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, the incoming Trump administration will probably reverse some of the more extreme elements of President Biden’s antitrust policy. The antitrust enforcement agencies under Biden have been hostile to mergers. This is likely to change. We could also see a more fundamental shift in antitrust policy, with a return to established norms that Biden and his appointees have sought to overturn.

The enforcement agencies’ willingness to forgo long-held antitrust norms in pursuit of the administration’s political agenda is the most controversial part of Biden’s antitrust policy. These norms represented a bipartisan consensus formed in the late 1970s through research, legal scholarship, and experience. While there have been disagreements about the specific ways in which agencies enforce antitrust laws, the consensus prevailed for decades with broad agreement between Republicans and Democrats on core principles.

The consensus held that the goal of antitrust is to prevent harm to competition. The upshot was that firms shouldn’t engage in conduct or mergers to enhance market power unless that market power comes from innovation, investment, competence, or efficiency. There was also a consensus that antitrust should protect competition rather than competitors. In addition, there was broad recognition that the consumer welfare standard should be the guiding principle of antitrust. Under this standard, the overarching goal of antitrust is maximizing the wealth of U.S. consumers.

Both the Democratic and Republican administrations before Biden upheld those norms. Then, in the past decade, the antitrust consensus began to unravel. In 2017, Khan, as a law student, published “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” The article gained wide attention, especially in progressive economic circles, and put her on the path to her current position. In it, Khan argued against the consumer welfare standard. Khan and others have instead advocated a new approach for enforcing antitrust laws, often referred to as the “New Brandeis School.” The name refers to Louis Brandeis, a Supreme Court justice nominated by President Woodrow Wilson and an important figure in the early antitrust movement.

Under this approach, antitrust serves a key role in pursuing broad policy goals, including protecting democratic institutions, preserving liberty, and combating social and economic ills such as income inequality, the rise of dominant corporations, imbalances among competitors, unfair treatment of workers, and concentration of economic power. The antitrust enforcement agencies under Biden’s administration have embraced the New Brandeis School. Like Khan, Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice Antitrust Division under Biden, has criticized the consumer welfare standard.

The Biden administration’s antitrust enforcers have extended the frontiers of antitrust to pursue the administration’s political agenda. It’s easy to find examples. In April 2024, the FTC issued a rule banning noncompete clauses. In September 2024, the FTC sued the three largest pharmacy-benefit managers for “unfair rebating practices,” accusing these companies of “artificially inflating insulin drug prices.” In May 2023, the FTC sued to block a merger between drug companies [Amgen](/market-data/stocks/amgn?mod=article_chiclet) and Horizon Therapeutics, alleging that the defendants’ actions “reveal a pattern of anticompetitive and unfair conduct.”

In all three cases, the FTC failed to articulate a credible theory of how the alleged actions weaken rivalry among competitors in a relevant market. This is a critical element of demonstrating harm to competition. Take, for example, the complaint against the pharmacy-benefit managers. The FTC’s theory of the case doesn’t entail any loss of rivalry among pharmacy-benefit managers. The agency simply claims that each pharmacy-benefit manager independently engaged in conduct harmful to consumers but without claiming that the conduct caused the companies to compete less vigorously against each other. These claims fall short of harm to competition.

The Amgen-Horizon merger went ahead after a settlement. A judge blocked the noncompete rule from going into effect; the FTC is appealing. The pharmacy-benefit managers dispute that they inflated insulin prices, and are mounting legal defenses.

In August, the DOJ sued software company RealPage for making private rental price recommendations to landlords (based on landlords’ data and a pricing algorithm). The DOJ accused corporate landlords of using the recommendations to raise rents above competitive levels, despite the lack of evidence of any harm to rental competition or any evidence that the alleged conduct significantly increased rents. Nonetheless, the Biden administration blamed high rents on “abusive corporate landlords.” RealPage is disputing the charges.

Under the New Brandeis School, just about any policy agenda can be deconstructed as an antitrust case. This approach lacks a limiting principle and has allowed the Biden antitrust enforcement agencies to weaponize antitrust to pursue favorite political causes.

Will the Trump administration adopt the same playbook? After all, Vice President-elect JD Vance called Khan “one of the few people in the Biden administration…doing a pretty good job.” The Trump administration could weaponize antitrust to go after companies that outsource jobs overseas, hire undocumented workers, or choose foreign over domestic suppliers.

There is reason to believe the Trump administration won’t do so. It’s unlikely to be an effective strategy, since courts appear unwilling to grant antitrust enforcement agencies broad regulatory authority over major parts of the economy. We’ve already seen this in the initial rejection of the FTC’s noncompete rule.

If each side weaponizes antitrust for political purposes, businesses and consumers lose, and antitrust stops being a tool for protecting competition. There is hope that the Trump administration will see the benefits of returning antitrust to the old bipartisan consensus that held for decades before the Biden administration abandoned it.

(Business Wire)[Interval funds](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bond-investors-are-better-off-in-interval-funds-heres-why-51590152400?mod=article_inline) have become one of the hottest investments in the fund universe, offering hard-to-beat yields, not to mention a dose of exclusivity and glamour. But investors need to be aware of their drawbacks—and hidden risks.

The funds—which make it easier for everyday investors to bet on hard-to-own assets like private equity and private credit—have been around since the early 2000s, but they have recently exploded in popularity. Assets have surged to more than \$80 billion, and big-name investment firms, including Capital Group, plan to roll out more funds, [according to Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/alternative-investments/morningstars-guide-interval-funds) .

Unlike hedge fund and private-equity fund investors, Interval fund investors don’t need to be accredited—that is, meet income or net worth thresholds. Instead, these vehicles are classified as mutual funds, and resemble something between an open- and closed-end fund.

Interval fund investors trade shares directly with a fund company, like an open-end fund, and can purchase shares anytime. But like closed-end funds, interval funds put restrictions on when you can get your money back. Typically, investors are allowed to withdraw money just once a quarter or once a month. And if too many investors ask for money back at the same time, funds reserve the right to limit redemptions.

“We love and we hate interval funds,” says Thomas W. Balcom, a Lighthouse Point, Fla.–based financial advisor. Balcom says he started using the funds as a higher-yielding substitute [for junk bonds](https://www.barrons.com/articles/yield-rates-junk-bonds-treasury-risks-9b708715?mod=article_inline) in the past few years. He puts up to half of investors’ fixed-income allocation into interval funds, but not more because he can’t count on getting the money out immediately. “It’s a complement to current positions, not a replacement,” he adds.

Morningstar tracks roughly 100 interval funds. Most of the largest and oldest ones own loans or real estate. These include the \$23 billion Cliffwater Corporate Lending fund (ticker: CCLFX), by far the largest interval fund on the market, as well as the \$4.6 billion Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate fund (TIPRX) and the \$4.5 billion Apollo Diversified Real Estate fund (GIREX).

More recently, however, ranks of funds targeting private credit—loans issued by nonbank lenders—have swelled, with well-known mutual fund firms like Franklin Templeton, First Trust, and Principal all launching contenders in the past few years.

Perhaps the recent emphasis on exclusive asset classes such as private credit should come as no surprise, given Wall Street’s desire to find lucrative alternatives to low-fee index funds, whose popularity with investors has put pressure on profits. “Of course, interval funds also offer better margins to asset managers than mutual funds, where fee competition continues to grind everything cheaper,” according to Morningstar.

While plenty of financial advisors love interval funds, there are potential drawbacks. While the funds are structured as mutual funds, they take their cues from hedge funds and private-equity funds when it comes to fees. The average interval fund charges an annual expense ratio of 2.5%, compared with 1% for open-end mutual funds, according to Morningstar. Popular index funds often charge less than 0.1%.

It can also be hard for investors to make sure they’re getting their money’s worth. About half the interval funds in Morningstar’s database launched within the past three years. Only about a dozen have 10-year track records—making it difficult to judge performance. The fact that many funds follow widely varying investment strategies is a separate hurdle. “It doesn’t make for robust peer groups,” Morningstar’s Brian Moriarty tells *Barron’s.*

Some advisors worry that interval funds may also be riskier than they appear. While investors can only withdraw from interval funds every few weeks or months, funds calculate their net asset values every day to accommodate incoming money. Still, because interval funds own illiquid assets, those NAVs aren’t necessarily based on up-the-minute, or even up-to-the-day, prices, and don’t necessarily reflect the price the fund managers would realize if they tried to sell their asset at any given moment.

The dynamic, in which funds publish daily NAV quotes that aren’t necessarily based on daily prices, could give investors a false sense of security, according to financial advisor Mark Wilson in Irvine, Calif. “Many of these strategies look quite stable because the underlying securities are not truly valued every day,” he says. “They look less dangerous than they really are.”

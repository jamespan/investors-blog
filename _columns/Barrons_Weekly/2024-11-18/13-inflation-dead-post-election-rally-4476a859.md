(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Let’s hope investors took a selfie of that brief moment when the [S&P 500](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) index [crossed the 6000 milestone](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-111124/card/the-s-p-500-falls-below-6000-again-blame-the-mag-7--qBa5GnH9hyFwkJbyxVxD?mod=article_inline) on Monday. The happy picture was spoiled soon after by the revived specter of inflation—and the possibility of higher rates.

The S&P 500 fell 2.1% to 5871 this past week, its worst week since September, while the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/market-data/indexes/djia?mod=article_chiclet) was down 1.2% and the [Nasdaq Composite](/market-data/indexes/comp?mod=article_chiclet) dropped 3.1%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note finished the week at 4.43%, after starting the week at 4.31%.

Inflation may not be as dead as presumed. The consumer price index released this past week showed inflation growing at a 2.6% annual clip, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking on Thursday after that release, said that the central bank could pause rate cuts [if inflation looks hot](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-powell-interest-rates-watch-speech-today-58708e76?mod=article_inline) . Market expectations for a December cut went from a near certainty to a coin flip.

Markets had also been pricing in all of the positive moves Donald Trump could make for stocks—including [an extension of tax cuts](https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/trump-tax-cuts-house-representatives-fe9dba0c?mod=article_inline) . But they seemed to have forgotten the other side of the ledger, including the possibility that some of the president-elect’s expected policies, such as tariffs, could goose inflation even more.

“This creates little room for incremental negatives from tariffs and/or higher rates tied to deficit concerns, especially against a euphoric sentiment backdrop,” wrote Citigroup strategist Scott Chronert. “Recall, markets traded well in Trump 1.0 until trade war concerns, higher rates, and softer-than-expected macro data dented sentiment.”

And sentiment does look a touch frothy. The S&P 500 trades for 22.2 times analysts’ expectations for earnings over the next 12 months, a level matched only twice before—1999 and 2021. In both cases, returns the following year were negative, notes DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas.

He’s not the only one that has pointed out the problem. “Unusually high U.S. equity valuations not only dampen long-term expected returns but also amplify the potential reaction to any economic weakness,” wrote Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius. Goldman still sees “modest positive returns” for stocks next year, but the latest run-up adds to the risk of pullbacks.

Nor are investors getting paid to wait and see how it all turns out. After averaging a 4% dividend yield from 1970 to 1990, the S&P 500’s yield fell to 1.2% on Monday, its lowest [in more than 20 years](https://www.barrons.com/articles/s-p-500-low-dividend-yield-3879960f?mod=article_inline) . Dividends have faded as tech stocks have accounted for a larger portion of the S&P 500, and even the introduction of payouts from tech behemoths hasn’t helped much— [Apple](/market-data/stocks/aapl?mod=article_chiclet) stock still yields just 0.4%.

That’s a concern even for set-it-and-forget-it investors, who can no longer count on dividends, which have made up a third of returns since 1940, to provide a buffer during tough times.

Come to think of it, investors might want to take a photo of this moment, too. Who knows what will happen next?

(Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)The frustration many investors feel over small-cap stocks is understandable. Small-caps have significantly underperformed their large-cap rivals over the past decade—even though [Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and researcher Kenneth French](https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424053111904742804579284840641750188?mod=article_inline) identified the small-cap factor as one that would lead to outperformance in their famous 1992 three-factor model.

Unlike a controlled scientific experiment where all the conditions are identical and therefore repeatable, though, the stock market is perpetually shifting, and investors may need to adapt their strategies as a result. Still, an intrepid fund manager can win even if small-caps aren’t scientifically proven to outperform.

Two major shifts have occurred since Fama and French did their research. First is the explosion in popularity of exchange-traded funds. A large portion of the assets flowing into ETFs go to those tracking market-cap-weighted benchmarks such as the [S&P 500 index](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) , which favor the largest stocks like [Apple](/market-data/stocks/aapl?mod=article_chiclet) over the smallest ones. Second is the dramatic decline in the number and types of publicly traded small companies.

The misleadingly named [FT Wilshire 5000](/market-data/indexes/w5000?countrycode=xx&mod=article_chiclet) index, which covers the entire U.S. stock market, had its [peak number of stocks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-wilshire-5000-was-the-first-total-market-stock-index-at-50-it-has-gone-global-f298283a?mod=article_inline) in 1998, at 7,378, and about 6,000 stocks in 1992, when the small-cap factor was defined. Now it has 3,370 stocks, primarily due to the loss of small-caps from acquisitions, bankruptcies, and fewer initial public offerings.

The theory behind the small-cap factor is that one should be rewarded with higher returns for the greater risk of investing in smaller businesses. But in the past 10 years, small-caps have lagged behind large-caps by five percentage points annually while being more volatile, Morningstar analyst Zachary Evens recently pointed out in an article provocatively titled [“Why Bother With Small-Cap ETFs?”](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/why-bother-with-small-cap-etfs) One reason is the loss of so-called unicorn tech companies, which are remaining private longer.

The [Morningstar PitchBook US Unicorn index](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-pitchbook-us-unicorn-FS0000HS6B?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview) tracks privately held, late-stage venture-backed U.S. companies with valuations of at least \$1 billion. Evens observes the number of companies in it has grown 1,100% since 2014 as the public small-cap market has shrunk.

“In decades past, a lot of those companies likely would have elected to IPO and be inserted in small-cap indexes, and by having some of those young, exciting, high-growth companies in small-cap index funds, it gives those funds a high potential long-term return,” he tells *Barron’s* . A private unicorn like OpenAI would have [a market cap over \$150 billion](https://www.barrons.com/articles/openai-latest-funding-valuation-157-billion-1b5279db?mod=article_inline) were it to go public now.

All this isn’t proof that the small-cap factor is dead. Indrani De, head of global investment research at FTSE Russell, which compiles the [Russell 2000](/market-data/indexes/rut?mod=article_chiclet) small-cap benchmark, acknowledges the growth of private companies in the tech sector, but argues there are other exciting sectors offering IPOs. “There’s a lot of innovation happening in the healthcare industry right now. And in healthcare, the Russell 2000 has a greater weight” than the large-cap [Russell 1000](/market-data/indexes/rui?mod=article_chiclet) index, she says.

According to FTSE Russell, the tech weighting in the Russell 2000 has hovered around 10% since 1983, while in the large-cap Russell 1000, it has exploded to 34.2% from 4.4% as of Aug. 31. The healthcare weighting in the Russell 2000 has grown from 7.5% in 1983 to 17.5% today versus the Russell 1000’s current 11.6% weighting. That healthcare weighting grew rapidly after the pandemic, when several biotech companies had IPOs in 2021.

Yet many of the 2021 biotech IPOs proved to be profitless investments that plummeted in the 2022 crash. While the Russell 2000 is arguably the purest expression of the small-cap factor because it doesn’t screen out such weak, profitless companies, Evens favors ETFs that track the [S&P SmallCap 600](/market-data/indexes/sp600eq?countrycode=xx&mod=article_chiclet) , as that index includes only profitable companies. One example would be the [SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap](/market-data/funds/spsm?mod=article_chiclet) ETF.

Wes Crill, senior investment director of Dimensional Fund Advisors, still believes in the small-cap factor but argues that active quantitative screens are necessary to eliminate weaker companies, which DFA applies to its popular [Dimensional U.S. Small Cap](/market-data/funds/dfsv?mod=article_chiclet) ETF. “Over time, we’ve found that small, low-profitability companies have much lower returns than the rest of the small-cap space,” he says. “It’s the same thing with small, high-asset-growth companies,” which are often serial acquirers of other companies.

John Barr, manager of the top-performing [Needham Aggressive Growth](/market-data/funds/neagx?mod=article_chiclet) fund, points to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 as the cause of many small companies staying private, as they can’t comply with the increased regulatory hurdles. “While [Sarbanes] had some great regulatory improvements, it added a cost of being public that pushed smaller companies out of the market,” he says. But his fund has only 87 holdings, and Barr says there are still “plenty of opportunities.” Still, he often favors so-called busted growth companies that have suffered hiccups but have hidden potential—not the fastest growers that venture capitalists want.

Small-cap value funds have also lost opportunities to private-equity funds that buy cheap public companies. Scott Barbee, manager of [Aegis Value](/market-data/funds/avalx?mod=article_chiclet) , says private equity hasn’t reduced the number of cheap stocks but the types of cheap stocks available. PE firms generally buy companies by adding large amounts of leverage to an acquisition’s balance sheet, but they often can do that only with stable businesses with consistent cash flows that can cover the debt’s costs. That’s difficult with cyclical businesses that have more volatile cash flows, even if those businesses are exceptionally cheap.

Consequently, Barbee has been buying energy and mining stocks, which are more subject to the whims of the economy. His fund has generated a 1,588% cumulative return versus the S&P 500’s 736% since its 1988 inception, according to Morningstar.

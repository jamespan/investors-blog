### The Fed’s Mr. “No”

 [TS Lombard](http://www.tslombard.com)   
 **Nov. 7:** [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell] isn’t resigning and will go to court, if necessary, to preserve the legal integrity of his position. He also said “no” (in Fedspeak) to the idea of many more cuts, fair enough given the policy uncertainties that lie ahead. The FOMC believes that the labor market has cooled enough for inflation to work its way back to 2% and the labor market is why the Fed cuts again—inflation’s progress will determine the pace. Given this perspective and that the Fed sees the current funds rate as restrictive with neutral still a ways off, they cut in December. The September consumer credit numbers underscore the notion that there is no reason to weaken labor any further. Recession is still not an option.

Next week’s CPI data consequently loom large in figuring the odds of a December cut. After December, it is anyone’s guess....The 25 basis-point cut in December is, in my view, insurance against further cooling in employment. [A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.] Then they watch and wait as 2025 unfolds. They believe that a 4.25% funds rate, given the pace of economic activity, allows them this luxury.

As for whatever policies that Donald Trump brings to the economy (taxes, tariffs, etc.), they would be assessed in the context of the economy’s performance at the time when these polices are put in place, not when they are proposed. As for what policies may be enacted and to what extent, Powell was clear: “We do not speculate, we do not guess, we do not assume.”

### Trump-Trade Sector Bets

UBS House View—Daily US   
 [UBS](http://www.ubs.com)   
 **Nov. 7:** Markets have started to digest Trump’s victory, with the initial response pointing to expectations of stronger growth, higher inflation, a slower pace of interest-rate cuts, and trade tariffs. As more-detailed policy proposals emerge from the Trump transition team, investors should brace for further swings ahead. We advise investors to be ready to use any outsize market reactions to build stronger long-term portfolios.

In equities, we expect the [S&P 500](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) index to reach 6,600 by the end of 2025 from 5,929 at present, driven by solid U.S. growth, lower interest rates, and enthusiasm over AI. Technology, utilities, and financials are among our preferred sectors. The key potential beneficiaries of deregulation—financials and energy—led the S&P 500 to a fresh record high on Wednesday. That was in line with our view that these sectors would likely outperform in the event of a Trump victory. The tech sector also advanced. The industry could face headwinds from trade tensions, but we do not believe that this will outweigh the structural growth story over the medium term, including optimism over the accelerating commercialization of AI.

### Rational Exuberance?

 **Nov. 6:** A decisive and uncontested election outcome electing Trump in a potential Red Sweep was nobody’s base case. In our Election Compendium, we modeled this as creating a “meltup chase” at a seasonally favorable [time of] year and [with] a public re-engaged in speculation. While stocks are expensive, expensive can last for a while. This market will be driven higher by the policy prospect of deregulation in D.C., driving a capital market cycle. Exuberance tends to arrive when capital markets ignite, and exuberance has been the hallmark of every market top. Exuberance lies ahead. We introduce a 6/30/2025 S&P 500 price target of 6,600, 25.7 times our \$257 2025 earnings-per-share estimate, and 27.5 times 2024’s estimated \$240.

In a century of bull markets, the average gain is 152% over 50 months. This bull is young at 25 months and a gain of 65%. The advance/decline line is very healthy, bolstered by strength in small-caps benefiting from a “soft landing.” That, along with the history of post-2020 and -2016 elections, as well as last July’s outperformance burst, bode positively.

### Rolling Back Regulations

Geopolitical Briefing   
 [National Bank of Canada](http://www.nbc.ca)   
 **Nov. 6:** One of Trump’s first actions after being sworn in on Jan. 20, 2025, will be to begin unilaterally rolling back certain environmental policies through executive orders. These include initiating withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, streamlining the permitting process for drilling on federal lands, expediting approval of natural-gas pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas export facilities, and removing emissions and clean energy targets. He will seek also to lighten the regulatory footprint in the financial, IT, energy, and mining sectors.

It is important to note that repealing, implementing, or rescinding new executive orders can be a lengthy process. It often takes months or even years to review and respond to potential legal challenges. Typically, these challenges are first heard in federal district courts. The more these cases are heard by judges appointed by Republicans, the better the chances that these executive orders will not be overturned.

### [Nvidia](/market-data/stocks/nvda?mod=article_chiclet), Welcome to the Dow

Global View   
 [The Lead-Lag Report](http://www.leadlagreport.substack.com)   
 **Nov. 6:** Nvidia is entering the [Dow](/market-data/indexes/djia?mod=article_chiclet) and replacing Intel. Swapping out one chip maker for another makes sense, but the traditionally stodgy index will be getting an accelerated dose of growth and AI exposure with this move. From an investor perspective, it’s worth mentioning that there is far less money indexed to the Dow than there is to the S&P 500, so there is much less potential for a fund-trading-related boost for the stock. The Dow gets a lot less attention today than it used to, but this change certainly brings it much further into the future than it was previously.

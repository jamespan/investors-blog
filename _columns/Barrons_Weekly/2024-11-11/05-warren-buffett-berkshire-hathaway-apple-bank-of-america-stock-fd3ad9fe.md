Warren Buffett is out of step with the booming markets.

As U.S. equity indexes surge for the second straight year, with the [S&P 500 index](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) returning 27% (including dividends) so far in 2024, the [Berkshire Hathaway](/market-data/stocks/brk.b?mod=article_chiclet) CEO has been selling stocks and raising the company’s cash to record levels.

The 94-year-old Buffett, who oversees Berkshire’s biggest stock investments, has [cut the size of the company’s largest equity holding,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-957a00c2?mod=article_inline) [Apple](/market-data/stocks/aapl?mod=article_chiclet) , by two-thirds to 300 million shares since the start of the year. He also trimmed what had been the company’s second-largest holding, [Bank of America](/market-data/stocks/bac?mod=article_chiclet) , by 25% since mid-July.

All told, Berkshire [was a net seller](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-earnings-apple-stock-0f031492?mod=article_inline) of \$127 billion of stocks this year, bringing its equity portfolio down to \$300 billion and nearly doubling its cash position to a record \$311 billion at the end of September. The cash and equivalents, mostly Treasury bills, are by far the most held by any U.S. company. That’s double Apple’s cash and equal to about 30% of Berkshire’s \$1 trillion market value.

Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for four of the past five years, and has largely missed a chance to capitalize on the post-Covid rally in stocks that began in 2020.

The only real winners that Buffett has added to the equity portfolio over the past five years are a [group of five Japanese trading companies](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-raises-its-stakes-in-5-japanese-trading-firms-to-8-5-188e0d15?mod=article_inline) now worth over \$20 billion, double Berkshire’s cost. [A \$13 billion investment](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-occidental-petroleum-losses-c796291a?mod=article_inline) in [Occidental Petroleum](/market-data/stocks/oxy?mod=article_chiclet) has generated attention but has made no money for Berkshire, *Barron’s* estimates.

Buffett could prove prescient in the long run. Even amid the recent bullishness, some market analysts believe stocks are pricey, especially when compared with their longer-term record. And if stocks plunge, Berkshire has plenty of firepower to pounce on bargains. For investors sitting on big gains, taking some profits as the market hits new highs could be a good strategy.

At least for now, Berkshire’s stock sales appear badly timed. *Barron’s* estimates that Buffett has left more than \$20 billion on the table with its sales of Apple this year, given that the stock is now at \$227, above our estimate of Berkshire’s average sales price of \$190.

Berkshire also has sold sizable stakes in banks since 2020—including [Wells Fargo](/market-data/stocks/wfc?mod=article_chiclet) , [Goldman Sachs](/market-data/stocks/gs?mod=article_chiclet) Group, and [JP Morgan Chase](/market-data/stocks/jpm?mod=article_chiclet) —at less than half where they now trade. That has likely cost Berkshire another \$20 billion in potential profits.

Buffett’s caution hasn’t hurt Berkshire’s stock price, which is up 28% this year—slightly ahead of the S&P 500—based on the Class A stock. It trades around \$695,000, while the Class B stock is doing slightly better this year and trades at \$463.

For investors, the key issues are Berkshire’s earnings trajectory, the potential deployment of the cash, the length of Buffett’s remaining tenure as CEO, and the company’s direction under Buffett’s likely successor, Greg Abel, 62, who now heads Berkshire’s sprawling noninsurance businesses, led by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and a large diversified utility, Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

The stock isn’t cheap, trading for around 1.6 times its Sept. 30 book value—above its 10-year range of about 1.45 times—and for 23 times estimated 2024 operating profits, excluding investment gains.

Buffett doesn’t think the stock is a bargain, judging from Berkshire’s share-repurchase program. He controls the pace, and Berkshire bought back no stock in the third quarter, the first such quarter since 2018.

Berkshire could end up repurchasing just \$3 billion of stock this year, which would be the lowest annual total since 2018. That would be down from \$9 billion last year and a peak of \$27 billion in 2021. Buffett will generally buy the stock when it trades below what he views as its intrinsic value.

Berkshire is around its estimated intrinsic value now, according to UBS analyst Brian Meredith, but the stock has traded at an average 15% discount over the past five years.

Berkshire’s outlook looks favorable, as the company’s earnings should be powered by strength in its huge property and casualty insurance business and extremely diversified group of noninsurance companies. The insurance businesses, led by auto specialist Geico, benefit from twin profit sources: underwriting and investments.

There’s also probably room for operational improvement in businesses such as Burlington Northern as Abel takes a more hands-on management approach than Buffett, who has written that he “delegates almost to the point of abdication.” The company’s operating profits after taxes are now running at an annual rate of \$45 billion.

Meyer Shields, a KBW analyst, argues that Berkshire could be a beneficiary of Donald Trump’s win. “Trump’s goal is to spur more economic activity, and this should translate to growth at the noninsurance subsidiaries,” he says. Berkshire’s businesses have a strong U.S. orientation.

Berkshire bulls also point to its so-called look-through earnings, a calculation embraced by Buffett, which give Berkshire credit for its proportional share of the earnings of the companies in its equity portfolio rather than just their dividends, which are what’s captured in reported earnings. Berkshire’s estimated look-through price/earnings ratio is closer to 19, below its GAAP earnings P/E ratio for 2024.

Another plus would be deployment of a chunk of the cash hoard through a big equity purchase or what Buffett calls [an “elephant-size acquisition.”](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-flaws-exposed-by-failed-buyout-for-tech-data-51575305940?mod=article_inline)

The outlook for either doesn’t look good. Prices of most stocks and businesses are at or near record levels, and Buffett has a value bent. He handicaps himself by refusing to participate in bidding wars for companies—something corporate boards often see as essential to maximizing shareholder value.

Berkshire will probably pay a dividend—something it hasn’t done for more than 50 years—but that likely will wait until Buffett is gone from the scene because of his opposition to it. It will be harder for Buffett’s successor to justify not paying one, given all the cash and ample earnings.

Buffett shows no signs of wanting to give up the top job, although some wonder whether the downsizing of the equity portfolio and the cash buildup are an indication that the date of his departure as CEO might be coming.

Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan says the Apple and Bank of America sales, plus Berkshire’s recent purchase of an 8% stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy from the estate of former Berkshire board member Walter Scott, could be signs of a “housecleaning.”

“It makes me believe that Mr. Buffett may be preparing the company for a leadership transition,” Shanahan wrote in an email to *Barron’s* .

“If a transition happened today, Greg Abel would appreciate that the Scott estate issue had been resolved,” he adds. “In addition, he would inherit a more balanced stock portfolio and a mountain of cash to begin the next phase of the company’s history.”

Once Buffett leaves the scene, there could be other management changes, notably the retirement of Berkshire insurance chief Ajit Jain, who is 73. One potential successor is Berkshire insurance executive Joe Brandon, the former CEO of Alleghany, which Berkshire bought in 2022.

“Succession probably means little from an operating perspective but a lot for the investor perception of Berkshire Hathaway,” Shields says. “Buffett has earned a distinctive place in the pantheon of investors and business leaders.” Whether investors are as excited about a Buffett-less Berkshire remains an important question.

Berkshire is about even with the S&P 500 total return over the past five years, but narrowly trails it over the past 10 years. Will it do so after Buffett? It isn’t easy to beat the tech-driven S&P 500.

Several analysts have Hold ratings or the equivalent on Berkshire. That includes Shields, who calls Berkshire the equivalent of an “index fund for the U.S. economy” given the breadth of its businesses. He says the S&P 500 may be preferable at current prices given the succession issue at Berkshire.

The bull case is that Berkshire has sufficiently strong businesses and earnings power to beat the market while offering one of the most defensive big-cap plays in the stock market, given its \$300 billion-plus in cash. If stocks plummet, Berkshire would be ready to capitalize.

With or without Buffett, there is a good case to be made for Berkshire. And the coming years promise to be eventful as the nearly 60-year Buffett era at Berkshire may come to an end.

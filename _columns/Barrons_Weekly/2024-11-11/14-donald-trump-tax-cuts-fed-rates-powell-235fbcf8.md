(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)To make America great, Donald Trump will want an economic boom as his legacy. Extending his 2017 tax cuts, plus adding his campaign promises to exempt tips, overtime pay, Social Security and so forth from taxes, are key parts of his plank. That, however, threatens to swell the already huge budget deficit even further, which has sent Treasury bond yields climbing sharply. This past week, the 30-year hit 4.60%, a four-month high.

But the former real estate developer could be tempted to seek a better deal on the most nettlesome part of the budget, the government’s interest tab, which now exceeds what it pays for defense. That might involve leaning on the Federal Reserve to bring down short-term interest rates, which in turn could help curb the government’s deficit, widely blamed for the inflation seen by voters as the nation’s No. 1 economic woe. It’s not exactly economic orthodoxy, but not much in the Trump agenda is.

All of which is speculative, to be sure. The nation’s central bank is legally an independent agency and its chair, Jerome Powell, has always insisted the Fed stays out of fiscal matters. But many economists suggest increased federal deficits, which would stimulate the economy and could boost inflation, might be [met with tighter monetary policy](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-inflation-federal-reserve-rate-cuts-9b2f2574?mod=article_inline) . So, the two aren’t totally separate.

Trump, meanwhile, has [made no secret of his disdain for Powell](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/election-results-trump-harris-2024/card/what-will-happen-to-fed-chair-powell-under-a-trump-presidency--5ffzyUTR5siatKy3FgSS?mod=article_inline) , whom he appointed in 2018, criticizing him for keeping rates higher than he liked and even floating the idea of firing him. More recently, Trump also said the Fed shouldn’t cut rates so close to the election, as it did in September.

At his press conference Thursday (following the Fed’s as-expected decision to trim its policy rate by another one-quarter percentage point, to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%), Powell was asked if would resign if asked by Trump. His terse response? “No.”

More provocatively, Scott Bessent—a prominent Trump advisor who heads hedge fund Key Square and who has been bruited as a possible Treasury secretary in the next administration—has proposed nominating and confirming a new Fed chair ahead of the end of Powell’s term in May 2026, as my colleague Matt Peterson [first reported last month](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-fed-chair-powell-fire-4b79079f?mod=article_inline) .

“At that point, no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore,” Bessent said. The market would take its cues from the Fed chair in waiting.

The deficit totaled over \$1.8 trillion, over 6% of gross domestic product, in the fiscal year ended September, a shortfall previously only seen during wartime or recessions.

As [graphically portrayed here](https://www.barrons.com/articles/world-debt-imf-100-trillion-taxes-f81644ff?mod=article_inline) , a big contributor has been the government’s interest expense, which is estimated to total \$882 billion this year, topping military spending at \$874 billion, and second only to Social Security at \$1.6 trillion. That’s in part due to the Fed’s sharp rate hikes, which lifted T-bill rates from just above zero in early 2022 to a peak of 5.34% in October 2023.

Unlike during Trump’s first run in 2016, when he said he would eliminate the government’s debt, the once and future president has pitched a litany of tax cuts during the recent campaign. More central will be the extension of the signature measure of his first term, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which expires at the end of 2025.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that all of Trump’s spending plans could add as much as \$15.5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years. A much smaller total seems likely, according to James Lucier of Capital Alpha Partners. Deficit hawks in the House of Representatives, which is now expected to remain under GOP control, could limit the total increase to less than \$7.75 trillion, the midpoint of CRFB’s debt increase estimate, Lucier wrote in a client note.

Tariffs would scarcely make a dent in that. The president-elect has suggested Elon Musk could head a “department of government efficiency,” which the tech mogul asserted could produce at least \$2 trillion in spending cuts, out of federal spending of \$6.75 trillion in fiscal 2024, which seems far-fetched.

Mandatory items, mainly Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, account for nearly two-thirds of federal spending. Interest, at about 14% of the budget, would be a target, which would leave more room for Trump’s tax proposals.

More importantly, the key to limiting, or even reducing, the burden of the government’s debt is to have interest rates lower than the growth of the economy. That is how the U.S. was able to slash its debt of 106% of GDP coming out of World War II all the way to 23% by 1974.

But it was more than the postwar boom that whittled the debt burden. It was financial repression—holding down interest rates—plus the inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s that pared debt relative to the economy.

Suppressed interest rates would be an expedient way to help Trump, the [self-described “king of debt,”](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-king-of-debt-224642) achieve his goals of tax cuts and a booming economy while limiting or reducing the burden of that debt. The only losers would be bond buyers, who would see the value of their investments whittled by inflation. But who cares about them?

**Corrections & Amplifications**

Deficit hawks in the House of Representatives could limit the total increase of Trump’s spending plans to less than \$7.75 trillion, according to James Lucier of Capital Alpha Partners. An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated the amount was \$7.75 billion.

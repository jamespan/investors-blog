Photo: Artem Zakharov/DreamstimeA postelection [sugar rush](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-stock-market-77c1c097?mod=article_inline) has settled into the stock market, but the mood in bond country isn’t so upbeat. While the [S&P 500](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) is notching record highs, the bond market is getting nervous that Donald Trump’s economic policies will fuel higher-than-expected growth, inflation, and deficits.

Bonds have been whipsawed by the election results—yields initially spiked and then fell back on soothing from the Federal Reserve, which [cut its benchmark rate a quarter-point](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/fed-november-meeting-interest-rate-decision-today/card/powell-says-25-basis-point-cut-was-further-recalibration--iHHNrvqKjf1puTlt4QLi?mod=article_inline) on Thursday. The volatility is disconcerting, especially if you’re relying on bonds for income in a retirement portfolio or hold them as a bulwark against declines in stocks. There are ways to cut your risk, though, without giving up much income.

The market is certainly skittish. The [10-year Treasury yield](/market-data/bonds/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx&mod=article_chiclet) was at 3.65% in mid-September. It has since leapt to 4.32%. Other long-term yields have also spiked, causing exchange-traded funds like [iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond](/market-data/funds/tlt?mod=article_chiclet) to lose 7% since Sept. 16, including interest income.

Yields, which move inversely to prices, were inching up before the election on expectations for faster economic growth, raising concerns that inflation won’t be coming down [as quickly as anticipated](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-inflation-policy-growth-economy-prices-stability-55064e15?mod=article_inline) . Trump’s election amplified the concerns.

Yet the U.S. bond market isn’t a monolith. Treasuries are essentially just bets on rates, since they have no credit risk (assuming the U.S. never defaults on its debt). The Fed oversees the short end of the yield curve through its rate policies, whereas the longer end reflects the market’s expectations for growth and inflation further in the future. The trend is now downward for short-term rates, assuming inflationary pressures don’t rear back up.

Some advisors aren’t making any moves for now, waiting to see how the underlying data pans out. “It’s a little too early for retirees to give up on the bond market,” says Steven Conners, president of Conners Wealth Management in Scottsdale, Ariz.

He plans to shift into floating-rate funds if aggressive tariffs fan inflation, but for now he’s largely standing tight with a typical retiree portfolio of one-third bonds in long-dated maturities across a smattering of categories, including closed-end funds. He also has exposure to income-generating pipeline companies, which are less correlated with the bond market. One fund he’s eyeing if inflation ramps up is [BlackRock Floating Rate Income Strategies](/market-data/funds/fra?mod=article_chiclet) .

Other advisors are sticking with shorter maturities. Mark McCarron, chief investment officer at Wescott Financial Advisory Group, is emphasizing bonds with two- to four-year maturities, along with mortgage-backed securities and agency mortgage securities.

Under Trump, he says, laxer regulation and lower corporate tax rates may fuel faster economic growth. “I think that growth translates into inflation down the road, and inflation is a concern for the bond market, particularly at the long end of the curve,” McCarron says.

Investors can tap into those themes through ETFs like [iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond](/market-data/funds/shy?mod=article_chiclet) , which yields around 3.9% and is up 3.6% this year, including interest income. The [Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities](/market-data/funds/vmbs?mod=article_chiclet) ETF is another option. It has a very low 0.04% expense ratio and currently yields 3.9%.

Corporate debt yields more than Treasuries, and default risks are exceptionally low in the investment-grade universe. The [iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond](/market-data/funds/igsb?mod=article_chiclet) ETF, for instance, yields 4.7% and is up 4.5% this year, including interest income.

If you’re looking for more income, albeit with more risk, consider adding a little “junk,” or high-yield bonds. The largest junk-bond ETF, [iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond](/market-data/funds/ushy?mod=article_chiclet) , is up about 8% this year and yields 6.6%. Remember, though, that junk bonds have that name for good reason: If the economy starts losing momentum, they are likely to fall fast.

With memories of 2022 still fresh, some retirees may wonder if they need to bother with bonds at all. That year, of course, bonds plunged nearly as much as stocks. Yet that was due to unusually high inflation, McCarron says, and those conditions are no longer present, while the economy appears to be humming along.

Bonds should resume their role as ballast in portfolios, he says. This, plus after-inflation yields that are more attractive than before the pandemic, mean bonds can remain a solid bet for retirement portfolios. A few tweaks may help, though, especially if the recent turmoil in bonds isn’t over.

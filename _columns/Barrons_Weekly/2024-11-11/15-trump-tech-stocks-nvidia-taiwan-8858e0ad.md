**Red Tsunami** . Donald Trump’s victory will have significant policy and geopolitical implications for every sector of the economy. The tech investing world generally celebrated his win, but it brings a complicated future for much of the sector.

Tech investors should prepare for uncertainty. In his first term, Trump often changed his mind on policies. Recall the back-and-forth on whether to ban TikTok before ultimately taking no action.

Predicting Trump’s moves isn’t easy, but here is my educated take of what his administration will do:

First, for Big Tech, I don’t expect significant changes compared with the status quo. It’s important to note that the government’s antitrust cases against [Alphabet](/market-data/stocks/googl?mod=article_chiclet) and [Meta Platforms](/market-data/stocks/meta?mod=article_chiclet) began under the first Trump administration. Trump’s vice presidential pick, JD Vance, has also complimented Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan’s leadership.

Ultimately, I anticipate that large technology companies may have an easier time completing deals, but the major antitrust battles will likely be mired in appeals and take years to play out.

AI and chip policy are areas where there will be significant differences under Trump, especially in terms of regulation. Trump has vowed to cut burdensome rules and red tape, such as [Biden’s AI executive order](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-regulation-openai-microsoft-cd279eeb?mod=article_inline) that mandated reporting requirements for AI companies. That should be good news for smaller innovative AI start-ups that won’t have to spend resources on compliance.

Another benefit to AI innovation could come in the area of energy deregulation. The U.S. is undergoing a massive build out of AI data centers, where the primary constraints are the supply of [Nvidia](/market-data/stocks/nvda?mod=article_chiclet) chips and access to electricity.

Earlier this week, stocks tied to nuclear energy fell after a federal commission ruled that [Amazon](/market-data/stocks/amzn?mod=article_chiclet) ’s plan to plug a data center directly into a nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania [shouldn’t go forward as proposed](https://www.barrons.com/articles/talen-stock-price-amazon-nuclear-deal-constellation-vistra-ferc-84a3da8d?mod=article_inline) . Other utilities objected to the project, as it wouldn’t go through the traditional grid.

A Trump administration will likely have a different take. To the degree AI becomes a national security issue, the Trump administration may prioritize the importance of nuclear energy and AI infrastructure, making it easier to build reactors and connect to data centers, signaling an “all systems go” approach. That would be good for AI data center stocks like Nvidia and nuclear power companies.

Then there’s the Chips Act and the geopolitics tied to Taiwan. In a recent interview, Trump criticized the Chips Act, saying “that chip deal is so bad,” adding that he could introduce tariffs on chip imports.

Last week Speaker Mike Johnson suggested a Republican Congress would repeal the legislation, though he quickly walked back the remarks after facing criticism from Republican congressmen from districts that benefit from new chip manufacturing plants. The bipartisan appeal will make it difficult to cancel that legislation.

But Trump’s proposal for additional tariffs on foreign-made goods could happen, and it may include chips and electronics, which would be positive for [Intel](/market-data/stocks/intc?mod=article_chiclet) , the largest manufacturer of advanced U.S.-made semiconductors. While Nvidia’s AI chips and hardware systems made in Asia could also face tariffs, the company should be able to pass on higher prices to its customers due to the insatiable demand for its products.

Nvidia may also benefit from chip export policy changes. Currently, Nvidia faces export restrictions for its advanced AI chips to China and certain Middle Eastern countries. While the China restrictions will likely remain in place, Nvidia could have an easier time getting licenses to sell chips to Middle East nations under Trump.

The big caveat here is Taiwan. The biggest risk for tech and the entire economy is Trump’s policy over the island. During the summer, he declined to provide assurances that the U.S. would protect Taiwan against Chinese aggression if he’s elected president.

“Taiwan should pay us for defense,” Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview at the time. “I wouldn’t feel so secure right now if I were them.”

If China interprets Trump’s statements to mean the U.S. wouldn’t defend the island, it could decide to invade or blockade Taiwan. That would send the global economy into chaos as nearly all the world’s advanced chips, which are critical for modern living, are still made in Taiwan.

Tech stocks rallied on Trump’s election. Intel and Nvidia shares jumped 7.4% and 4.1%, respectively, on Wednesday, with the [Nasdaq Composite](/market-data/indexes/comp?mod=article_chiclet) up 3%. Shares of Alphabet, were up 4%.

There were two notable laggards: Meta Platforms was off 0.1%, while [Taiwan Semiconductor](/market-data/stocks/2330?countrycode=tw&mod=article_chiclet) fell 1.3%.

Donald Trump won his rubber match election against the Democrats decisively, a ringing endorsement of his mandate. And the markets roared in approval of this Trumpvember surprise, with the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/market-data/indexes/djia?mod=article_chiclet) logging its biggest gain (1508 points, or 3.57%) in two years on Wednesday.

Layer upon that the fact that having the uncertainty of the election out of the way is seemingly a longstanding plus for the market, as November and December are two of the [S&P 500](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) ’s strongest months over the past six decades (with November being No. 1, up over 1.5% on average), according to Bessemer Trust’s Holly MacDonald and Jeffrey Mills.

A Trump presidency might continue to supercharge the markets—perhaps, as some wags suggest, even more than Blackstone President Jonathan Gray’s much-talked-about [inspirational morning-run videos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-d-gray/recent-activity/all/) on LinkedIn do. The speed, though, to which the rather obvious conclusion that Trump Part Deux is a boon for stocks could quickly be priced in, yet another reminder to always stay invested.

Less obvious is a critical implication of the mostly unfettered capitalism that will accompany the next Trump administration, engendered by GOP control of the Senate and perhaps the House. Yes, expect tax cuts, less regulation, fewer guardrails, and a government no longer picking winners and losers (except for tariffs), all reasons why investors perceive the incipient environment to be advantageous. And yet, with all the dancing, dancing, dancing in the streets, note that this new freedom could be accompanied by greater risk in the capital markets. The Donald may be a once-in-lifetime difference-maker, but even he hasn’t figured out how to obviate this immutable law of economics: With greater returns comes greater risk.

That subject of risk is stimulating grist for market sage Howard Marks, 78, whom I spoke with before the election as part of our [At Barron’s](https://www.barrons.com/video/column/at-barrons) video interview series, and a bit after as well. Marks, co-founder and co-chairman of alternative-asset firm Oaktree Capital Management (\$205 billion in assets under management)—and known for his pointed memos—isn’t unlike Warren Buffett in that his wisdom can sometimes seem simplistic and folksy. Yet, as with Buffett (a fan of Marks’ missives), if you ruminate on his teachings, you usually find something you hadn’t considered.

Example: When I asked Marks about finding a money manager who could produce sustainable above-market returns, he said: “That reminds me of what Don Meredith once said on Monday Night Football, ‘They don’t make them the way they used to. But then again, they never did.’”

“Howard has the ability to think second-order,” says Oaktree co-founder and portfolio co-manager Sheldon Stone, who has worked with Marks for over four decades. “You talk about something and he’ll make you think further.”

What will a Trump presidency be like? I asked Marks on Thursday. After noting that Trump will be pro-business, Marks says, “Many of the things he wants to do or that he talked about doing would be inflationary, like lower interest rates and cutting taxes.” Trump’s tariffs “are an attempt to repeal the laws of economics.”

“Probably 98% of the things Trump will do can’t be predicted, and even the consequences of the things we know he’ll do probably can’t be predicted,” he continues. “Anybody who tells me what they think the world’s going to look like two years from now, I’ll bet all my money that they’re wrong. The future is just too damn indeterminate to hang your hat on. John Kenneth Galbraith said, ‘We have two kinds of forecasters, the ones who don’t know and the ones who don’t know they don’t know.’ ”

Circling back to our previous conversation, I asked him to expound on Marksist theory about risk.

“People want to be able to take the concept of risk and use it in a formula to do computations,” Marks says. “The only number that’s available to use as a proxy for risk is volatility, or the standard deviation of prices or returns. That’s not what risk is. Risk is the probability of losing money, [but] there is no number you can use for that because there’s no place you can look to find out what the probability of a bad outcome is today or what it was six months ago when you made the investment. So, you can be quantitative but not accurate, or accurate but not quantitative. You can’t do both.”

How do investors apply that point? By being wary, Marks says, of those who say they can attach a number to risk. “Precision increases the likelihood that people will attach significance to things they shouldn’t,” he says. “Mark Twain said, ‘It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.’ ”

(Lessons about losing money bear repeating—a thought that struck me as I was listening to Al Pacino narrate the audiobook version of his wonderful autobiography *[Sonny Boy](https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/books/sonny-boy-review-a-star-early-and-late-e0bb3d55?mod=article_inline)* , when he rasped, “I had \$50 million and then I had nothing,” referring to when he was conned by a crooked accountant, who was sentenced in 2011 to more than seven years in prison for running a Ponzi scheme. Not just flaky actors were fleeced. Sophisticated executives and a member of the Mellon family were [also taken by the scheme.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704005404576176960198327934?mod=article_inline) )

I was curious as to where Marks, a fixed-income aficionado, came out on the great rate debate. “Anybody who came into this business after 1980, so almost everybody in the business, has only lived through declining interest rates or ultralow interest rates,” he says. “People tend to say, ‘This is normal. I’m going to extrapolate it to the future.’ No, that was an unusual time. Declining interest rates and ultralow interest rates dominated the history of the last 44 years, but I don’t think they’re going to be the norm going forward.”

That means a higher rate environment, right? “I think we’re going to be in a normal rate environment. The emergency rates of zero are no longer called for. When rates are too low, they subsidize asset owners and borrowers and penalize savers and people living on fixed income and lenders. The Fed and the Treasury should let interest rates occur naturally through negotiation between borrower and lender, and I don’t think when the lender and the borrower sit down to negotiate, they’re going to agree on half a percent or zero.”

Marks urges increased investment in bonds—yes, he oversees what is basically a bond house and thus is talking his book—which runs counter to Paul Tudor Jones and Stan Druckenmiller, who’ve said recently they are avoiding or even shorting bonds.

“​​I’m not a trader,” he says when I mention those names. “My investments are for the long term. I’m not predicting that bonds are going to go up in price. There are lending investments today from which you can get a substantial contractual return. Take high-yield bonds, an asset class that I’ve been in for the last 46 years. Today they offer about 7% interest. That’s a good level. For somebody who says, ‘I think the next move of interest rates is up,’ it may not be attractive. But it may be a good long-term investment. My goal is not to predict the movement of prices; it’s to make loans to companies that will pay me back.”

One of my favorite Marksisms is: “There are no bad assets, only bad prices.” I asked him to expound upon that. “A good asset is not synonymous with a good investment,” he says. “It’s not what you buy, it’s what you pay that determines a good investment. You have to be price-conscious. It’s not a matter of buying good things, but buying things well. You have to understand that difference. It’s more than grammatical.

“I started working in this business 55 years ago, and the banks invested in the [Nifty Fifty](https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB891056669711984500?mod=article_inline) —stocks of the 50 best companies in America—companies so great, there was no price too high,” he says. “If you bought those stocks the day I started work and held them tenaciously for five years, you lost over 90% of your money. Why? Because they were too expensive.”

Does that thinking apply to the [Magnificent Seven](/market-data/funds/mags?mod=article_chiclet) ? “You can’t make meaningful observations about assets unless you know them extremely well, and I don’t,” he says of that group. “They have high price/earnings ratios, but sometimes a high-priced car is worth it and a low-priced car isn’t. Everybody thinks these are great companies. They may be. I don’t think people should have a knee-jerk reaction on that subject. I try not to.”

In a memo Marks wrote in September, “Shall We Repeal the Laws of Economics?”, he extolled the virtues of capitalism: “History is littered with command economies that didn’t succeed.…Eighty years ago, Korea was a single country. Then, following World War II, it was split in two….South Korea has operated as a capitalist democracy and North Korea as a communist dictatorship…[North Korea’s] GDP in purchasing power terms is estimated at \$2,000 per person versus \$50,000 in South Korea. North Korea’s citizens are described as impoverished, but at least it doesn’t have a border problem, since nobody’s trying to sneak in….I think it’s fair to say capitalism has won.”

I laughed out loud at North Korea’s non-border problem and then realized that Russia, Cuba, and Venezuela don’t have border problems either. And of course, we do. And the reason people clamor to come here is because our country is a beacon. Yes, our soon-to-be full-throttle capitalism is part of it, but underpinning it is our gold standard rule of law. If our legal system degrades and, for instance, litigants can habitually influence the legal process, that would be tantamount to removing Lady Justice’s blindfold.

And capitalism without justice…isn’t good for the market.

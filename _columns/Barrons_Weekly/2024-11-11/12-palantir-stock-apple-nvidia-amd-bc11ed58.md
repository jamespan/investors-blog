The New York State Common Retirement Fund, which covers New York State and Local Retirement System members, retirees, and beneficiaries, cut positions in [Palantir Technologies](/market-data/stocks/pltr?mod=article_chiclet) , [Apple](/market-data/stocks/aapl?mod=article_chiclet) , and [Nvidia](/market-data/stocks/nvda?mod=article_chiclet) stock, and bought more [Advanced Micro Devices](/market-data/stocks/amd?mod=article_chiclet) shares in the third quarter. The pension disclosed the stock trades, among others, in [a form it filed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/810265/000081026524000009/xslForm13F_X02/nys092024.xml) with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The office of New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, the sole trustee of the pension, declined to comment on the investment changes. As of June 30, it [managed assets of \$267.7 billion](https://www.osc.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/08/dinapoli-state-pension-fund-valued-267-point-7-billion-end-first-quarter) . [Pensions & Investments](https://www.pionline.com/largest-us-retirement-plans/2023) notes the fund is the third-largest U.S. public pension by assets.

Palantir stock was added to the [S&P 500 index](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) in September, which provided some lift as [funds that track the index bought shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-dell-sp-500-96d22771?mod=article_inline) of the data-analytics firm. Chairman and co-founder Peter Thiel [sold more than \$1 billion of Palantir stock](https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7?mod=article_inline) over September and October through a trading plan.

New York State Common Retirement Fund sold 231,600 Palantir shares to end the third quarter with 1.1 million shares. Palantir stock soared 116% in the first nine months of the year, compared with a 21% rise in the S&P 500. So far in the fourth quarter, shares are up 13% while the index has slipped 0.5%.

The pension sold 1.5 million Apple shares in the third quarter to lower its stake to 19.6 million shares of the iPhone maker. Shares rose 21% in the first nine months of the year, and so far in the fourth quarter, they are down 4.3%.

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently began [selling stock through a trading plan](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-sale-ceo-tim-cook-ec8934e7?mod=article_inline) that will expire in about two years. The rollout of Apple Intelligence, the company’s branded artificial-intelligence technology, [has been slow](https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-iphone-ai-rollout-36a1646a?mod=article_inline) . Not all the features are available yet, which may mean consumers may be slower to buy new iPhonese to take advantage.

Chip maker Nvidia has been the banner stock of AI, and shares have rocketed along with investor enthusiasm. Shares soared 145% in the first nine months of 2024, and so far in the fourth quarter, they are up 11%.

Nvidia reported a [strong second quarter](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/nvidia-earnings-stock-price-today?mod=article_inline) at the end of August. At the end of September, CEO Jensen Huang’s trading program [completed the sale of six million shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-ceo-jensen-huang-5ba38f1c?mod=article_inline) , removing an overhang for Nvidia stock.

The pension sold 3.1 million Nvidia shares to end the third quarter with 30.5 million shares.

New York State Common Retirement Fund bought 102,505 more AMD shares in the third quarter to lift its stake to 2.4 million shares.

AMD stock rose 11% in the first nine months of the year, but so far in the fourth quarter, shares are about 13% lower.

In the past week, AMD provided a [disappointing outlook](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amd-earnings-stock-price-8122d159?mod=article_inline) that overshadowed a third-quarter earnings report that was in line with expectations. The stock tumbled. Some analysts have said that AMD [can’t compete yet](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amd-stock-price-nvidia-ai-chips-7baa9acf?mod=article_inline) with Nvidia on the AI front.

**To the Editor:** Excellent article on Walmart (“ [Walmart Is on a Winning Streak. How the Walton Family Keeps the World’s Biggest Retailer on Track](https://www.barrons.com/articles/walmart-retail-walton-family-8bd89096?mod=article_inline) ,” Cover Story, Nov. 1). Board Chairman Greg Penner’s assertion that “Walmart is a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money so they can live better” is nicely stated and right on.

I should add that Walmart vendors provide great support to the company. At quarter’s end, Walmart reported inventories of about \$56 billion, with vendor accounts payable of about \$57 billion. With vendor funding standing at 102% of inventories, Walmart has less than zero of its own money tied up in inventories. In economic terms, that makes Walmart a de facto consignment operation, and that helps fuel a powerful boost to return on invested capital.

### Don’t Overlook BDCs

**To the Editor:**   
 The feature concerning nonbank lending vehicles barely mentions publicly traded business development companies (“ [Move Over, Banks. Alternative Asset Giants Plunge Into Private Credit](https://www.barrons.com/articles/banks-alternative-assets-private-credit-0f76bdbd?mod=article_inline) ,” Oct. 29).

At their current enhanced market prices, publicly traded BDCs still provide significant yields in addition to their valuation increases. After significant growth in market value, BDC yields are more meaningful than those in most other areas of the market.

The largest of the publicly traded BDCs, Ares Capital, now yields 9.1%. Another major BDC, Blackstone Secured Lending, yields 10% after a share increase. Sixth Street Lending, another substantial entity, yields 10.4%. And Trinity Capital, a smaller company, yields more than 15%.

### Money in the Ground

**To the Editor:**   
 One thing about gold miners is that they don’t have to market their product, and there is zero risk that gold will go out of style or get canceled due to environmental concerns (“ [Gold Mining Stocks Are a Bargain. Here’s How to Buy In](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gold-mining-stocks-bargain-buy-ef186c10?mod=article_inline) ,” Nov. 1). There is no substitute or replacement for gold. A gold mine is basically money in the ground.

### RMDs: No Need to Wait

**To the Editor:**   
 For people who anticipate large required minimum distributions, or RMDs, there is no reason to wait until you must take distributions (“ [Tax Rates Could Go Up. Make This Move Now](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tax-rates-rise-one-retirement-move-38fcbf7f?mod=article_inline) ,” Retirement, Oct. 31). What I do is calculate each year what my RMD will be and what tax bracket that will land me in. Any money I can take out at a lower bracket I convert to a Roth IRA. No sense letting those lower tax brackets go to waste.

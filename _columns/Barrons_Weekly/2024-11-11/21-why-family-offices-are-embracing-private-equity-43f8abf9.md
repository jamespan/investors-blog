Family offices invest in private markets through direct stakes in companies, funds, and co-investments with PE firms. The PE trend aligns with a September survey from Campden Wealth and RBC Wealth Management, in which family offices said PE and venture capital offered the best long-term risk-adjusted returns, followed by stocks. Some 42% expect more private exposure this year, while 19% see adding exposure to stocks.

Developed-market stocks returned 17.8% on average for family offices last year, notes Campden, compared with 11% for direct PE investments and 7% for PE funds. But, says Bastiat Managing Partner Nader Afshar, public-market outperformance “can sometimes be an indicator that private markets, which tend to lag behind by a few months or more—particularly in less efficient asset classes—may soon follow suit.” Long-term strategies, he says, are a “natural fit for patient capital like family offices.”

Bastiat and Kharis also explore more-nuanced trends. Among them: Families thwarted by lack of initial public offerings and M&A have turned to “continuation funds,” which allow PE firms to provide liquidity for exiting investors.

(Samuel Corum/Bloomberg)There are a lot of things that Donald Trump says he’ll change when he takes office. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will be fairly high on the list.

At [a Bitcoin conference in July](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-bitcoin-reserve-and-fire-gensler-3876ad79?mod=article_inline) , Trump vowed to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler “on day one.” Wall Street is one of the industries that Trump promised to free from the Biden administration’s regulations. That liberation may get a boost from the new administration’s [efficiency guru](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-musk-trump-election-rivian-1086ba9f?mod=article_inline) , Elon Musk, who has had [his own beefs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-elon-musk-sec-51645557508?mod=article_inline) with the securities regulator.

“We’re going to see a pretty major pivot here,” says John Gulliver, executive director of The Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, an industry think tank.

Wall Street may be eager to see Gensler exit, but reversing the course that he has set in motion will take longer than a day.

New presidents traditionally appoint new SEC chairs. Asked by *Barron’s* if Gensler would step down, the agency wouldn’t comment. But the chair has said in public that he knows that elections have consequences and he won’t depart from the accustomed practice.

Speculation is rampant about whom Trump might appoint as the next SEC chair. He’s unpredictable. But many mention one of the two current Republican commissioners, [Hester Peirce](https://www.sec.gov/about/sec-commissioners/hester-m-peirce) . Appointed by Trump in his first presidential term, Peirce is an industry favorite. She voted against most of Gensler’s initiatives and tried to keep the agency out of Wall Street’s hair.

In one instance, however, Peirce has clamored for regulation—and that’s for the [cryptocurrency business](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-commissioner-and-crypto-mom-hester-peirce-is-amazed-a-bitcoin-etf-hasnt-been-approved-yet-51645786345?mod=article_inline) . Gensler and his Trump-appointed predecessor, [Jay Clayton, sued](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-says-ripple-improperly-sold-cryptocurrency-51608675654?mod=article_inline) crypto startups that didn’t [register their products](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-crypto-regulation-ripple-coinbase-d8143058?mod=article_inline) as securities. Peirce opposes this enforcement approach, and argues that new regulations should be drawn up for crypto’s technology.

A pro-industry SEC may prove to be a mixed bag for one Wall Street denizen: the activist investor.

When activists mount proxy campaigns against a company’s management, the activists seek the endorsement of proxy advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis. In Trump’s first term, the Clayton SEC sought to regulate the advisory firms, notes Kai Liekefett, a partner at Sidley Austin. Gensler arrived and pulled the plug. Now if Trump’s second SEC succeeds in reining in the advisory firms, it could blunt one of the activist’s sharp implements, Liekefett says.

As chair, Gensler certainly pursued one of [the most ambitious regulatory programs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-sec-gary-gensler-81bee62a?mod=article_inline) of any chief in recent SEC history. In some 40 adopted rules, he succeeded in speeding the settlement of stock trades and improving disclosures by special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs.

But some of Gensler’s most ambitious proposals—such as reforming how Wall Street handles stock trades—met such loud opposition that the commission never adopted final versions of the rules. Those proposals aren’t likely to be taken up by Trump’s SEC.

Other rules were adopted and then challenged in court. Out of nine final rules challenged, courts have vacated three. One of those rules covered the firms that render advice on proxy voting. Another would have set new rules on disclosures around companies’ repurchase of their shares. And the third rule would have expanded disclosures required of firms that manage hedge funds, venture capital, and private equity.

Among the Gensler SEC’s rules now in court, perhaps the most widely debated is enhanced disclosure of [climate-related risks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/climate-disclosure-sec-iosco-714f389b?mod=article_inline) . The SEC voluntarily put the rule on hold while it is litigated.

Litigation continues on rules that require hedge funds and their brokers to report on short positions and stocks lent for short selling. The Managed Funds Association trade group says decisions on those lawsuits may actually come down before Trump takes office. That may also happen in another case, concerning a rule that classifies some investment firms as securities dealers for certain kinds of trades.

Industry insiders say a Trump SEC may choose not to appeal adverse court decisions on rules that the new administration would rather see disappear.

For other Gensler rules that the new administration may dislike, it will take time for revisions to percolate through the administrative process. “A new leadership cannot come in and just flip a switch and reverse what Gensler put forth these past couple of years,” says Jillien Flores, the managed funds group’s government affairs chief. “It won’t work that way.”

As for SEC enforcement cases now pending. It would be more unusual for the agency to abandon them midstream. The current enforcement chiefs may even try to speed some investigations into becoming live cases before the turnover, says Haimavathi Marlier, a partner at Morrison Foerster who was a senior SEC trial counsel under two administrations. That’s what Clayton did, when his [SEC sued the crypto firm](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-says-ripple-improperly-sold-cryptocurrency-51608675654?mod=article_inline) Ripple Labs.

But most pending SEC cases will continue into the next administration, she says, as if there had never been a new election.

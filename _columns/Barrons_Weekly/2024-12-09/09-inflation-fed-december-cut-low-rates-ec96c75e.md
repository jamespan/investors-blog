For Federal Reserve watchers, the question is when, not if, the central bank will lower rates again. Another cut may come in December, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell [has said](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-powell-interest-rates-watch-speech-today-58708e76?mod=article_inline) he’s still thinking it through. “The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,” he said recently.

Powell is certainly right that there’s no hurry. The Fed still faces a protracted battle against higher prices. The voters in both parties effectively cast their ballots for more inflation in November. Rate cuts should be off the table, and not just for the next meeting. A return to the era of ultralow interest rates would put the economy back on a risky course.

Why is inflation, which was supposedly brought under control under President Biden, a continuing threat? Let me count the ways.

First, even if Calvin Coolidge himself, that parsimonious avatar of small government, had won the recent election, there would be no basis for believing that Washington will effectively constrain borrowing and spending during the next four years.

Yes, President-elect Donald Trump promised to cut spending and regulations. But where is the constituency for fiscal restraint? Everyone in Washington wants to cut waste, as long as it’s the other fellow’s. Incumbent industries find that regulation isn’t so bad when it serves to wall out competition.

We can expect pressure for higher defense spending. Meanwhile, federal budgets assume that the vast majority of the nation’s \$1.6 trillion in student loans will be repaid. That of course is a pipe dream. But if large sums are forgiven or go unpaid, that will only boost deficits and inflation.

Other forces will add momentum to the inflationary impetus of federal spending. For one, the boom years in global trade are over. China became the world’s workshop in good part because of government policy but also because its low-cost workforce led to lower prices virtually everywhere. But China is changing. Wages there are no longer so cheap, and the workforce is shrinking as old age takes its toll.

Trump is putting protectionist [tariffs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tariffs-stocks-outlook-7c9b6bc6?mod=article_inline) back on the table, and a surprising variety of people no longer find that beyond the pale. Americans finally are waking up to the realization that without an industrial base, our country will not create enough high-quality jobs, let alone defend itself. So expect higher prices, not just for imports but for their domestic substitutes.

It’s true that in all likelihood we would continue piling up debt under any president, and so the best we can do is vest our hopes in the Fed. Monetary policy can’t do everything, but it can certainly help avoid the kind of mistakes that make matters worse.

That’s why it’s imperative that the Fed abandon its plans for more interest-rate cuts and hold the line where we are. The alternative is not only further inflation, but all the other underappreciated ills that accompany artificially low rates. Not least of these would be the continued transfer of wealth to the top 1% as cheap money inflates the assets of the richest.

If the Fed has the sense to stop its rate-cutting, it could do even more than combat a possible resurgence of inflation. Excessively low interest rates might seem appealing, but the artificially cheap money they create is a harmful and addictive drug that inflates asset bubbles, driving stocks, bonds, and real estate to dizzying heights. Financial instability follows.

Superlow rates function like Robin Hood in reverse. They take from retirees and frugal working people who can’t get a decent, risk-free return on their savings and give to the rich, who own most of the appreciating assets. Would-be home buyers might be clamoring for rate cuts, but low mortgage rates don’t make homes cheaper when we can’t (or won’t) increase supply.

Cheap money promotes unhealthy consolidation in the business world, sustains staid corporate incumbents at the expense of innovative newcomers, and promotes the financialization of the economy.

In short, bankers and private-equity firms love cheap money. The rest of us get very little out of it.

And yet the Fed’s every instinct is to return to low interest rates. Its decadelong adherence to low rates and quantitative easing wasn’t based on empirical evidence. Rather it was based on theoretical models and untested academic dogma. Unfortunately, the Fed is still dismissive of real-world evidence that ultralow real rates are associated with anemic growth.

In 2011, I co-authored the first peer-reviewed empirical study on the impact of ultralow rates on long-term growth. At the time, the prevailing view among economists and the Fed was that a zero or near-zero short-term interest rate stimulated the economy. The lower the rate, the better. Our study showed that, far from stimulating growth, ultralow rates materially retarded expansion. And the lower that interest rates fell below the historic real norm of 3%, the worse the impact.

Already, there are signs that inflation is far from slain. In September the Fed’s favorite inflation measure—the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which sets aside volatile energy and food prices—had its [biggest monthly gain](https://www.barrons.com/articles/september-pce-inflation-report-release-today-b212d65d?mod=article_inline) since April. [October’s reading](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/october-pce-inflation-data-report-release-today?mod=article_inline) was higher still.

If the Fed continues cutting rates, you can expect more of the same.

 [Bitcoin](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/cryptocurrencies/btcusd?iso=kraken&mod=article_chiclet) ’s meteoric rise is raising an uncomfortable question: Is there a place for cryptocurrency in your retirement accounts?


Bitcoin, the biggest crypto by market cap, has surged 142% this year. President-elect Donald Trump positioned himself as a crypto-friendly candidate. Since his win, Bitcoin has jumped 48%, topping \$103,000, partly on hopes that a new Republican-led government will embrace crypto, possibly even buying it for the U.S. Treasury. 


 Many advisors and other experts remain cautious, seeing Bitcoin as a speculative asset, not an investment. That said, owning a little Bitcoin probably wouldn’t hurt; just don’t overdo it, and bear in mind its many risks. 


“I don’t think most retirees need Bitcoin,” says Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar. “To the extent they hold it, put it in the ‘mad money’ portfolio.”


It’s hard not to feel the fear of missing out if you’ve been on the sidelines during the crypto surge. Bitcoin and brethren like 
[Ether](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/cryptocurrencies/ethusd?iso=kraken&mod=article_chiclet) have risen sharply this year, fueling big gains in companies like [MicroStrategy](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/MSTR) and [Coinbase Global](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/COIN) . The global token market value now stands at \$3.7 trillion, and crypto entrepreneurs are flying high—including one who recently paid \$6.2 million for a [piece of banana art](https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/sotheby-s-auction-banana-duct-tape-maurizio-cattelan-justin-sun-art-basel-miami-02231817?mod=article_inline) (which he ate).


For sober-minded retirees, Bitcoin should be no more than a side bet: Don’t count on it to make up for savings shortfalls or reliable returns. 





While Bitcoin has been around for nearly 17 years, there isn’t good modeling on its performance in various market scenarios, says Jamie Hopkins, chief wealth officer at [WSFS Bank](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/WSFS) . Aside from its recent spike on hopes for a friendlier climate in Washington, it’s often fueled by macro conditions; when interest rates surged in late 2021 and 2022, Bitcoin tanked alongside stocks and bonds.


“Most Bitcoin and crypto investments remain in the speculative category until proved different,” says Hopkins, who recommended a tiny allocation for the past decade.


Some advisors argue that Bitcoin has proved itself through years of market cycles and macro climates. “In reality, Bitcoin is an asset class that’s here to stay,” says Douglas Boneparth, an early adopter and president of Bone Fide Wealth. “How many more Thanksgiving dinners need to take place before skepticism wanes and we get mainstream adoption?”






It’s important to separate Bitcoin as a financial asset from something with actual utility. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin emerged as a decentralized digital currency with its own system of governance and issuance, enabling transactions that would remove the middleman of a financial institution. But Bitcoin’s extreme volatility makes it impractical as a currency for everyday purchases. The ability to conduct transactions without a third party has proved more useful to criminals than law-abiding people who have no issue going through banks or traditional payment apps.


There’s more of a use in developing markets with unstable governments and currencies. Doug Ornstein, director at TIAA Wealth Management, says he’s watching to see if central banks embrace digital currencies. If they were to play a role in monetary policy, he says, that would represent a significant development and cause him to rethink his position to steer clear. 


Trump’s election catalyzed hopes that Bitcoin will enter the mainstream, backed by the U.S. government. At a Bitcoin conference over the summer, Trump called for a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” including digital assets seized in criminal cases and other proceedings. A Senate bill called the Bitcoin Act would direct the Treasury Department to establish a [strategic Bitcoin reserve](https://www.barrons.com/articles/crypto-volatility-makes-a-u-s-bitcoin-reserve-unlikely-6d960a30?mod=article_inline) , allowing the government to buy and store the crypto.





Despite some Republican backing, the Senate bill’s prospects are still a “long shot,” says Peter Eberle, president of Castle Funds, a crypto investment firm. “But the fact that it’s even in discussion is wild.”


Exchange-traded funds are the easiest way for investors to [access the cryptocurrency](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-bitcoin-is-falling-what-to-do-now-39339567?mod=Searchresults&mod=article_inline) . The



[iShares Bitcoin Trust](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/funds/ibit?mod=article_chiclet) 

 ETF is the largest in the space, with \$48 billion in actual Bitcoin (unlike funds that invest through futures contracts and charge higher fees). It has a low, 0.25% expense ratio, and its large asset size keeps trading costs to a minimum. 
Alternatively, investors could buy some Bitcoin and hold it in a digital wallet through a brokerage like Coinbase or Fidelity. These firms generally don’t charge annual expenses, though trading the token may incur fees and the brokers would take a small cut on buy or sell orders. 


If you want to dip a toe in, stay small. Hopkins recommends an allocation of 1% of your overall portfolio. Of course, that raises the question of what to do if Bitcoin’s price continues to soar and that 1% balloons to 5% or more. If you decide to pare your position, keep in mind that the [Internal Revenue Service treats cryptocurrencies like stocks, bonds, and other assets for the purpose of assessing capital-gains taxes](https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/selling-crypto-tax-law-19e08263?mod=Searchresults&mod=article_inline) .


Think of Bitcoin like a lottery ticket: While some analysts see it eventually reaching \$1 million, it could also tank 75% in a matter of months. Given its volatility, it isn’t something you should count on, especially if you rely on your portfolio’s income for everyday expenses. 


“If this is money you’re going to live on for the next two, three, four, or five years, it’s probably too risky,” Eberle says. “Once you start losing sleep,” he adds, “you know your allocation is too big.”

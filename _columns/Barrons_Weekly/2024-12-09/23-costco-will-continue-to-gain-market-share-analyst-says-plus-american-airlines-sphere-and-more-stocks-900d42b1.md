[Parsons Corp.](/market-data/stocks/psn?mod=article_chiclet) • PSN-NYSE   
 Buy • \$99.05 on Dec. 5   
 by Benchmark Research   
 Will Parsons be a beneficiary of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE? At a conference yesterday, Parsons suggested potentially as much. Parsons [a technology-focused infrastructure-engineering firm] noted that DOGE is set to be an advisory board that will provide advice to agencies for implementation, specifically on how to become more efficient and reduce costs. Parsons provides many such solutions utilizing technology such as automation and artificial intelligence to reduce costs (human input).

Further, Parsons noted that it isn’t involved with the agencies that have been targeted so far, such as the Education and Veterans Affairs departments, Internal Revenue Service, or Federal Bureau of Investigation. However, Parsons noted that it could actually help those agencies implement more automation technology solutions.

Further, on the DOGE concept of reducing bureaucracy, this may help Parsons speed up procurement. Therefore, Parsons currently sees DOGE’s ethos to increase efficiency as an opportunity that aligns with Parson’s core value-added offering. Target price: \$130.

[American Airlines](/market-data/stocks/aal?mod=article_chiclet) • AAL-Nasdaq   
 Buy • \$14.88 on Dec. 5   
 by Seaport Research Partners   
 This has been a rough year for American Airlines, but based on first-quarter 2025 schedules and today’s credit-card deal [with Citi, extending their co-branded partnership for the next decade], we’re comfortable that the airline will execute on revenue in 2025, which should drive a rerate in shares. We are boosting our 2025 outlook and upgrading the stock to Buy from Neutral on an improved risk/reward scenario, and implementing a \$20 price target.

[Costco Wholesale](/market-data/stocks/cost?mod=article_chiclet) • COST-Nasdaq   
 Outperform • \$990.92 on Dec. 5   
 by Raymond James   
 We have updated our model to reflect recent currency trends, fuel pricing, and November/fiscal-first-quarter sales, reported on Dec. 4. The positive fundamentals of Costco’s business model that make it a long-term compounder and market-share gainer remain well intact, and fiscal-first-quarter comparable-sales results reiterated these aspects.

Moving forward, we continue to see the potential for a decade-plus of new U.S. and international club openings (about 26 net new openings estimated for fiscal 2025). Furthermore, Costco’s clean balance sheet and robust free cash flow leave management ample flexibility to grow and return capital to shareholders (paid \$15 per share special dividend during fiscal-second-quarter 2024).

All-in, Costco’s product mix, sticky customer base, and leading value proposition position it well to gain further market share in a wide variety of economic environments and continue to grow earnings. We reaffirm our Outperform rating with a target price of \$1,030.

[Synopsys](/market-data/stocks/snps?mod=article_chiclet) • SNPS-Nasdaq

Buy • \$588 on Dec. 5

by Needham

Synopsys provides its first fiscal-year 2025 outlook and sees top-line growth of 10.1 to 11.1% on a continuing operations basis, which misses the consensus estimate at 13% but is close to our estimate of 11.3%, which had factored in the extra week in fiscal 2024 and the second-half-loaded profile for fiscal 2025.

While the full-year outlook is more or less within our expectations, fiscal-first-quarter 2024 guidance came in much lower than we expected, likely due to a near-term air pocket in the intellectual-property business, which is expected to return to full strength in fiscal-second-half 2025. While the print is imperfect, we think the pullback will create another buying opportunity for investors who missed the postelection rally in Synopsis.

We still see \$640 as the right price target and continue to rate the stock a Buy.

[TJX Cos.](/market-data/stocks/tjx?mod=article_chiclet) • TJX-NYSE

Buy • \$125.50 on Dec. 5

by TD Cowen

We attended [TJX](/market-data/stocks/tjx?mod=article_chiclet) Cos.’ annual sell-side meeting and store tour at its Framingham, Mass., headquarters, hosted by senior management, including CEO and President Ernie Herrman. We came away incrementally more positive on the market-share opportunities that its banners collectively offer and the resultant flow-through to sales and margin expansion. With a level of consistency in its performance that tends to be atypical of retailing in general, we think this should continue to support double-digit earnings growth into fiscal 2026 and a mid-20s multiple on our above-consensus forward earnings-per-share estimate. We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our price target to \$138.

[Sphere Entertainment](/market-data/stocks/sphr?mod=article_chiclet) • SPHR-NYSE

Buy • \$38.30 on Dec. 5

by Seaport Research Partners

While the nearest-term catalyst for Sphere Entertainment shares hinges on the MSG Networks’ debt work-out outcome (the forbearance period was again extended, to midnight on Dec. 20), the company continues to fill in its Sphere opportunity set.

Concert promoter Live Nation announced that Dead & Co. will again take up residence at the Las Vegas Sphere for 18 dates in calendar-year 2025.

We reiterate our Buy rating on Sphere Entertainment shares and our \$52 price target on a blend of MSG Networks debt elimination as well as fundamental growth opportunities at Las Vegas and with other franchise announcements.

**To the Editor:**   
 In articles like Karen Hube’s “ [How Trump’s Tax Cuts and Tariffs Will Affect Your Wallet](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tax-cuts-tariffs-wallet-ca405b63?mod=article_inline) ” (Guide to Wealth, Nov. 29), I’m always amazed at the unconditional Roth IRA rollover recommendations. When authors talk about the potential for tax increases, they never consider that Roth distributions may be taxed in the future, particularly for high-income individuals. As a debt-heavy government looks for revenue and for wealthy individuals to “pay their fair share,” it seems reasonably likely that Roth distributions will become a target.


 Roth rollovers may even become vilified as a mechanism for the rich to avoid paying taxes. Thinking through the retirement math for current high earners, they will pay tax on the rollover at the highest marginal rate. If the traditional IRA distribution is the retirees’ source of income in a given year, they will pay much lower rates on much of that distribution. Instead of blindly rolling into a Roth, people may want to consider the advice of Robert Kiyosaki: “Don’t pay taxes until you have to.”

Geopolitical Wild Card
----------------------

 **To the Editor:**   
 Regarding “ [What the Trump Tax Cuts Mean for the Deficit and Your Bond Portfolio](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tax-cuts-deficit-bonds-676c1987?mod=article_inline) ,” Guide to Wealth, Nov. 29): What will affect the markets even more than tax cuts is geopolitical events.


The second go-round for President-elect Donald Trump starts in a much more complicated and nuanced situation. But the U.S. protecting trade has been a staple since 1798, and abandoning Ukraine and Taiwan isn’t going to protect trade.

Buffett and Munger
------------------

 **To the Editor:**   
 Regarding “ [How Warren Buffett Will Give Away \$150 Billion. Will His Kids Be Able to Finish the Job?](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-philanthropy-heirs-berkshire-hathaway-c85fe26b?mod=article_inline) ” (Nov. 17): I don’t see the \$150 billion ever being given away completely. Buffett has managed to avoid estate taxes and create dynastic wealth. But the constant selling pressure from the foundation will be hard to overcome, as will the law of large numbers. Buffett and Charlie Munger are the secret sauce, and when they’re gone, institutional mediocrity will be the likely outcome.

Off to the Races

 **To the Editor:**   
 Enzo Ferrari had a special appreciation for Veblen economics (“ [Ferrari’s \$4 Million Car Will Supercharge the Stock. The Auto Maker Is Leading the Luxury Pack](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ferrari-f80-luxury-auto-maker-leader-stock-could-rally-e902757b?mod=article_inline) ,” *Barron’s* Stock Pick, Nov. 27). Generating exclusivity comes before anything else. Manufacture (far) less than demand calls for, ensure that those products get in the hands of a few friends or celebrities, and, above all, succeed at racing. Then the money will take care of itself.

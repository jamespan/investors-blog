When the Fed cut interest rates in September and then again in November, it should have been good news for housing stocks—except the [iShares U.S. Home Construction](/market-data/funds/itb?mod=article_chiclet) exchange-traded fund has fallen 4.1% since the Fed first moved on Sept 18. It’s not hard to see why. When the Fed cut rates, long-term bond yields spiked, causing mortgage rates to rise with them.

Now, Treasury yields have finally started to recede again ahead of the Dec. 17-18 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, when the central bank could cut again. That could eventually lead to a dip in mortgage rates, which would be good news for prospective homebuyers—and investors in housing-related stocks.

The housing sector needs all the help it can get. Home sales have been sluggish for the better part of two years due to affordability concerns. The combination of high prices and a surge in financing costs that culminated in the 30-year mortgage rate hitting its highest level since 2000 in November 2023 have dampened buyer interest.

There are some nascent signs of a turnaround, though. Pending home sales rose in October, the third consecutive month of increases. And existing home sales were up in October as well, the first year-over-year gain since July 2021. New home sales are still falling. But one portfolio manager thinks that there will finally be a rebound in 2025.

“There is absolutely pent-up demand for new construction and housing,” says Nick Frelinghuysen, co-chief investment officer of equities at Chilton Trust. “And this is an area of the economy that the new presidential administration and the Fed would love to see stimulated.”

Frelinghuysen is betting on the potential rebound through a combination of builders and retailers that have close ties to housing. His firm owns shares of [Lennar](/market-data/stocks/len?mod=article_chiclet) and [Champion Homes](/market-data/stocks/sky?mod=article_chiclet) , as well as [Home Depot](/market-data/stocks/hd?mod=article_chiclet) and [Sherwin-Williams](/market-data/stocks/shw?mod=article_chiclet) , which was recently added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Even though several housing-related stocks have posted solid gains this year, the iShares U.S. Home Construction and the [SPDR S&P Homebuilders](/market-data/funds/xhb?mod=article_chiclet) ETFs both trade at forward price/earnings ratios in the midteens, slightly below their five-year highs. “Valuations are not extremely stretched,” Frelinghuysen notes.

Builders also may benefit more than existing home sellers because they could lure buyers with offers to purchase a house at a lower mortgage rate than the buyer can get at a bank, says Sean Dobson, CEO and founder of The Amherst Group, a real estate investment firm. “It’s a tight housing market and fewer customers can make the math work,” he says. “But builders can reduce prices by offering subsidized mortgages.”

Investors may get a better read on the housing outlook on Dec. 9 when luxury homebuilder [Toll Brothers](/market-data/stocks/tol?mod=article_chiclet) reports its latest quarterly results. Analysts are expecting about 5% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenue. But builders seem more upbeat about next year, particularly in the wake of the election.

“Builders are expressing increasing confidence that Republicans gaining all the levers of power in Washington will result in significant regulatory relief for the industry that will lead to the construction of more homes,” says Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders in a builder-sentiment report put out by the NAHB and [Wells Fargo](/market-data/stocks/wfc?mod=article_chiclet) in mid-November.

A little confidence should go a long way.

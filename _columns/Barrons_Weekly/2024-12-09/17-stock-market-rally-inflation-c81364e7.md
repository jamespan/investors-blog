Traders are optimistic, dare we say giddy, about outlooks for the market and economy in 2025. The job market remains fairly solid. Earnings are expected to be strong next year. The Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates. And thanks to the Republican sweep in Washington, the market is betting on lower taxes, deregulation sparking a merger boom, and fiscal stimulus pushing growth rates even higher.

But at the risk of being an investing Grinch, inflation could wind up putting a dent in this impressive Santa Claus rally. Market experts are slightly concerned about the fact that it’s taking longer for inflation to retreat to the 2% level that the Fed would like to see. Pricing pressures have remained stubborn.

That’s why Wall Street will be watching the consumer price index report for November that comes out on Dec. 11 very closely. Economists are forecasting that overall prices rose 2.6% over the past 12 months and that the core figure that excludes food and energy costs was up 3.3%. That would be unchanged from October but it’s down from a 3.4% total increase in December 2023 and 3.9% rise for the core. That’s still a ways off from 2% though, which could mean that the Fed may slow the pace of interest-rate cuts next year.

Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, says she’s in the higher-for-longer camp when it comes to interest rates. “We could have sticky inflation and a stronger economy,” she says. “The markets were optimistic earlier this year that inflation was decelerating at an acceptable rate, but that last mile will be difficult for the Fed to tackle.”

The political landscape is a concern too. The “red wave” in Washington could lead to more inflation due to fiscal stimulus. And if Trump’s threatened tariffs on just about every U.S. trade partner come to fruition, that could further reignite inflation concerns.

“If you take Trump’s policies at face value, there is a worry that it adds significantly to the deficit. That and tariffs could add to inflation,” says Matt Eagan, portfolio manager and head of the full discretion team at Loomis Sayles. “The knee jerk reaction is that the Fed would lean in against that and it may be tough for it to keep cutting rates.”

Still, there are hopes that Trump’s tough talk turns out to be just that. “I expect that the bite will be less than the bark from Trump,” says David Kelly, chief global strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Kelly argues that unless there are significant policy changes in Washington, “2025 should be much like 2024 and that’s a good backdrop for equities.”

Kelly concedes that valuations, with the [S&P 500](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) trading at 22 times next year’s earnings estimates, are rich. But that doesn’t concern him necessarily. “Yes, U.S. equities are expensive. But they could get more expensive.”

It all depends on whether the “good” aspects of Trumponomics outweigh the possible negatives that may boost inflation. Nelson Yu, head of equities at [AllianceBernstein](/market-data/stocks/ab?mod=article_chiclet) , thinks investors can continue to bet on the American exceptionalism trade. He says that deregulation and lower taxes should help boost profits for all companies, leading to a further broadening out of the rally beyond the megatechs of the Magnificent Seven. The “other 493” stocks in the S&P 500, as well as small and mid-caps, should benefit too. “There are a lot of catalysts for a broader segment of companies to do well,” Yu says.

In other words, investors have to broaden their horizons. “The best prescription for uncertainty is to embrace diversification,” says Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager of equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. That goes without saying in any market environment. But it may be even more important now.

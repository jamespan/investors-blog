(Leon Sadiki/Bloomberg)South Africa’s Government of National Unity, or GNU, has kept the lights on, and itself intact, for nearly half a year now. That has been enough to push the [iShares MSCI South Africa](/market-data/funds/eza?mod=article_chiclet) exchange-traded fund up 17% and yields on 10-year sovereign bonds down by nearly two percentage points.

The government joins the African National Congress, or ANC, heirs to Nelson Mandela’s antiapartheid struggle, with the white-dominated, pro-business Democratic Alliance.

“The GNU has cemented some of the previous government’s better policies, and they have changed the PR a bit,” says Kieran Curtis, head of emerging market local currency debt at asset manager abrdn. The GNU also just passed 250 days without blackouts from beleaguered national utility Eskom.

Investors are divided on how far the rally can run without more-substantive achievements. Both sides start from South Africa’s daunting challenges: Official unemployment runs above 30%. Investment in the critical mining sector has dwindled to near zero, thanks to prohibitive bureaucracy, says Terence McNamee, a Johannesburg-based fellow with the Wilson Center.

“South Africa has fallen to a third-tier mining destination with a very anachronistic approach to regulation,” he says.

To optimists, that means continued little improvements can go a long way. “What makes the South Africa case really compelling is that it’s a country with a strong plan for growth,” says David Aserkoff, J.P. Morgan’s equity strategist for emerging Europe and the Middle East.

Power provision has improved thanks to a sort of ad hoc creeping privatization, as businesses and households end-run Eskom with their own solar panels.

Aserkoff expects more of the same elsewhere: mining companies repairing the railroads from their pits to ports, for instance.

The consumer economy is getting a more immediate jolt from a pension reform that allows employees to tap 10% of their retirement savings annually. That has made Aserkoff bullish on retail and banking stocks.

Curtis is a buyer of South African bonds, too. Creeping privatization could boost growth—which limped along below 2% annually for most of the past decade—without igniting inflation, he says. That would help the government reduce debt, now above 70% of gross domestic product, without painful expenditure cuts. “Revenue should improve,” he concludes. “I’m still pretty happy.”

Rory Kutisker-Jacobson, a portfolio manager at Allan Gray in Cape Town, feels like he has seen this movie before. South African markets caught fire in 2017 when current President Cyril Ramaphosa took over the ANC and then the presidency. The good vibes dramatically faded.

“Having lived through Ramaphoria, I’m once bitten, twice shy,” Kutisker-Jacobson says. “It feels like sentiment has run far ahead of structural improvements again.”

Seun Oyegunle, portfolio manager for the T. Rowe Price Africa & Middle East fund, will believe South African economic acceleration when he sees it. “The market looks at 2% growth as a magic number,” he says. “I’m skeptical they can make that sustainedly.”

One factor in the country’s favor is having little direct exposure to the U.S., as President-elect Donald Trump promises to ramp up tariffs. South Africa depends much more on China, and global manufacturing broadly, for an export stream dominated by metals and coal.

The coalition of rivals in Pretoria looks increasingly like providing political stability, too, with the promise of at least incremental reform.

“I thought the GNU would fall apart at the first sign of stress,” Oyegunle says. “But they’ve made some difficult choices.”

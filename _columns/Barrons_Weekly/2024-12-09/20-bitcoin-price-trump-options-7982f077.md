Donald Trump speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in July.






When Donald Trump returns to the White House in January after a four-year interregnum, 
[Bitcoin](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/cryptocurrencies/btcusd?iso=kraken&mod=article_chiclet) is expected to be a key beneficiary.


The grand pooh-bah of cryptocurrencies is expected to gain the legitimacy that supporters have craved since Bitcoin was created in 2007, as the greatest financial crisis since 1929 was forming. Since then, Bitcoin has divided and electrified the world as prices have advanced with the predictability of a drunken hummingbird on steroids.


 Bitcoin now has a halo because of Trump and anticipation that Bitcoin could become as legitimate as U.S. government bonds. That assertion might seem outlandish, but creating an international currency would be a profound accomplishment for any politician.


Many investors have eschewed Bitcoin, but that merits reconsideration, especially following the launch of Bitcoin options.


Nasdaq-listed 
[iShares Bitcoin Trust](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/funds/ibit?mod=article_chiclet) launched [on Nov. 19](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-etf-options-ibit-59de7627?mod=article_inline) . The exchange-traded fund’s options quickly became one of the options market’s most actively traded listings, which bodes well for Bitcoin.


Options on hot securities often stabilize liquid markets by creating a place for sophisticated traders to hedge risk and reveal their price expectations.


Since the ETF’s options listing, [Bitcoin has traded to record prices](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-bitcoin-is-falling-what-to-do-now-39339567?mod=article_inline) . On listing day, Bitcoin was trading around \$92,000 and has since moved toward \$100,000.


The ETF’s options-trading patterns are bullish, which suggests that investors expect it to keep rallying. And President-elect Trump is the most meaningful force for higher prices.


He is expected to appoint a [Bitcoin-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission chairman](https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/trump-jay-clayton-us-attorney-03f4c1ca?mod=article_inline) . A shift in America’s regulatory regime could accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption as a currency that is controlled by market forces, not central banks.


Despite Trump’s support, the Bitcoin investment thesis is speculative until it isn’t. Such is the reality of trading Washington policy changes, which are often more erratic than Bitcoin’s price trajectory.


In such conditions, options can create place markers for investor while a thesis evolves. Options cost less than buying the equivalent amount of stock, or digital currency.


With IBIT around \$54.47, aggressive investors can consider selling the March \$53 put and buying the March \$60 call for about \$5.80.





This risk-reversal strategy—selling a put and buying a call with the same expiration but higher strike—lets investors buy low and profit from a rally. If the ETF rallies to \$80, the call is worth \$27.


If it plummets below the put’s strike price, investors must buy the ETF at the higher put strike or make adjustments to avoid assignment.


The options strategy offers a superior return to owning Bitcoin—at least in terms of percentage returns. If the ETF rises from its current price of about \$55 to a record high of \$80, the percentage return is about 46%.


If someone opts instead to buy Bitcoin, recently trading around \$95,707, the price would have to appreciate to a record high of about \$140,000 to make the same return.


Moreover, the amount of money needed to trade the ETF is a lot less than is needed to buy Bitcoin. For these reasons, options are often used by sophisticated investors to define risks, and rewards, when they like an investment thesis but want to allow time for anticipated facts to mature.


The March expiration was chosen to give time for policies to emerge from Washington that will legitimize Bitcoin. If the process is volatile, and unpredictable, that’s just the nature of the moment.

  Intel just took the lead, with close competition from Stellantis. Don’t count out Boeing.

Intel is having a tough year. Its headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif.











 [Intel](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/intc?mod=article_chiclet) might have just taken the lead. Not in chipmaking technology—there, it appears as far behind as ever. With the sudden departure this week of CEO Pat Gelsinger, and shares down 52% year to date, the company is an early favorite for Ugliest Turnaround Attempt of 2024. But [Stellantis](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/stla?mod=article_chiclet) , down 47%, is a close second, with its own surprise CEO exit this week. Don’t count out [Boeing](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/ba?mod=article_chiclet) , down 39%, or [CVS](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/cvs?mod=article_chiclet) , down 25%, which both changed chief executives earlier this year.


 I’m only considering companies with iconic brands and still-substantial stock market values that haven’t sought bankruptcy protection, and whose customers don’t wear five days worth of clothing to save \$55 on baggage fees—sorry, [Spirit Airlines](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/saveq?mod=article_chiclet) . 


What makes Intel the front-runner in this wrong-way race is how its problems seem to lock each other into place. Intel designs and manufactures chips—two totally different jobs, it turns out. It’s losing market share in servers and personal computers, where it once dominated, to the combination of [Advanced Micro Devices](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/amd?mod=article_chiclet) , which designs chips without the burden of manufacturing them, and [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/2330?countrycode=tw&mod=article_chiclet) , whose vast scale gives it unmatched ability to fabricate leading-edge designs.


Intel’s plan to fix this has been to build new factories to take on Taiwan Semi in contract chip fabrication, while racing through its own new chip designs to recapture the lead from AMD. There are problems: The cost has taken Intel from generating \$38 billion in free cash over the two years ended 2020 to likely burning close to \$25 billion between last year and this year. It isn’t clear that Intel’s rivals in chip design will be comfortable depending on it for their manufacturing. Intel itself still uses Taiwan Semi for its latest designs. And if Intel is on track to catch up with AMD on design, why would Gelsinger leave before the victory party?


The next CEO can’t just split off Intel’s manufacturing business to stem losses, because the company was recently awarded nearly \$8 billion by the U.S. government to build up domestic chip production. Meanwhile, Intel, which two decades ago turned down an opportunity to buy a videogame chip maker called [Nvidia](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/nvda?mod=article_chiclet)  for \$20 billion, has watched that company top \$3 trillion in market value, because the highly parallel processing that’s used to draw game pixels turns out to be just the thing for artificial intelligence. Intel’s own AI chips are barely selling, so its stock market value has collapsed from a 2020 peak of over \$275 billion to a recent \$105 billion during the biggest moneymaking opportunity in semiconductor history.










Other than that, things are fine. Except that Intel remains highly exposed to PCs, where the industry outlook is “grim,” according to a Monday note from BofA Securities, and where machines might increasingly run on smartphone-type chips, a market that Intel left years ago. But we have to turn now to the runners-up. 


Stellantis is a Netherlands-based mash-up of France’s Peugeot and Italian-American Fiat Chrysler that, until recently, was run by Portuguese executive Carlos Tavares, best known for helping to turn around Japan’s [Nissan](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/7201?countrycode=jp&mod=article_chiclet) . Tavares slashed costs and led the company to record sales and profits just last year. Suddenly, both measures are plummeting. Amid pandemic shortages, Stellantis focused on high-price vehicles. Some Jeep Grand Wagoneer SUV models even pushed above \$100,000, otherwise known as two loaded Honda Pilots. Vehicles are no longer in short supply. Elevated interest rates and the soaring cost of car insurance have sapped buying power. Now Stellantis’ dealers in North America, a key profit center, complain of inventory they can’t sell.


What the market needs now is cheaper vehicles. What Stellantis has in the pipeline, however, is a parade of electric vehicles with premium prices. Tax incentives for EVs could fade under the incoming Trump administration. Anyhow, sales trends suggest that customers would prefer hybrids for now. Stellantis shares trade at four times a depressed 2024 earnings forecast.  


Boeing came to a deal with its workers last month, ending a strike. Now all that’s left is to fix pretty much everything else. Fatal crashes grounded a key model, cut production, and led to years of cash burn. Mechanical mishaps this year have restarted that process. The company installed a new CEO this past summer, and has recently issued large amounts of stock to raise money.  





That Boeing doesn’t appear higher on this list is owed to two things. There is no alternative to jumbo jets for mass travel over long distances. And the market is controlled by Boeing and Europe’s [Airbus](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/air?countrycode=fr&mod=article_chiclet) , 



 which is so stretched that it’s booking orders a decade out. China’s Comac makes jumbo jets mostly for its home market. Brazil’s Embraer makes narrow-body jets for regional flights. That makes Boeing’s turnaround seem both far off and inevitable. Among analysts covering the stock, 53% say to buy it, versus 40% for Stellantis and just 11% for Intel. 
On that scale, CVS looks downright popular, at 66% buys. I compared the [company](https://www.barrons.com/articles/cvs-is-underperforming-unitedhealth-its-drugstores-are-to-blame-0d35ecf2?mod=article_inline) unflatteringly with [UnitedHealth Group](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/unh?mod=article_chiclet) in October, and some readers wondered why I hadn’t instead chosen another drugstore chain. It’s because the more important part of CVS is Aetna, a rival in health plans to UnitedHealth. Also, CVS’s ambition for years has been to lure patients to its in-store clinics for care, which would put it up against United’s network of doctor practices.


But CVS’s clinic push has stalled. It has been buying more traditional medical practices, but it remains tiny there relative to UnitedHealth. Drugstore trends are dismal. But a rebound in Aetna margins appears likely, with the Trump administration expected to be better for its Medicare Advantage profits than the Biden one, according to Morgan Stanley. CVS appointed a new CEO in October. Its free cash generation has been cut by more than half, but it remains solidly positive, with close to \$6 billion projected this year. Shares go for 11 times earnings.

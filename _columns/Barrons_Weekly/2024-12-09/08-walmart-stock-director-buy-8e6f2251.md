![](https://images.barrons.com/im-80756389/?width=639&height=426)Bob Moritz, a Walmart director, is a former global chair of PricewaterhouseCoopers.  (Lionel Ng/Bloomberg)[Walmart](/market-data/stocks/wmt?mod=article_chiclet) stock has been surging in 2024, and the retailer’s newest director just bought a large block of shares.

Walmart has seen shares soar more than 70% so far this year, trouncing the gain in the [S&P 500](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) . Consumer confidence has been [shaky at times](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-092424/card/consumer-confidence-slides-as-labor-market-worries-pile-up-XpLo1fwTpEJsJRMi8Ula?mod=article_inline) in 2024, but Walmart’s [earnings have been strong](https://www.barrons.com/articles/walmart-stock-price-earnings-consumers-5764151f?mod=article_inline) .

Director Bob Moritz paid \$500,000 on Nov. 27 for 5,446 Walmart shares, an average price of \$91.81 each. He now owns 7,805 Walmart shares in a personal account, according to [a form Moritz filed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104169/000112760224028230/xslF345X05/form4.xml) with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Walmart didn’t respond to a request to make Moritz available for comment.

Mortiz, former global chair of consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers, [joined Walmart’s board Aug. 15](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/08/15/bob-moritz-former-pricewaterhousecoopers-chairperson-named-to-walmart-board-of-directors) . The purchase represents his first on the open market as a company insiders. The other shares he owns were equity grants for his service as a director.

Walmart has [stock-ownership guidelines](https://s201.q4cdn.com/262069030/files/doc_governance/2023/04/legal-10614492-v1-wmt_corporate_governance_guidelines_4_11_2023.pdf) for nonemployee directors, but there was no need for Moritz to meet them so quickly. Outside directors have five years to acquire shares, restricted stock, or stock units that total five times the annual cash retainer at the time the director joined the board. Walmart’s [latest proxy](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/104169/000010416924000078/wmt-20240424.htm) notes that the cash retainer is \$100,000, so Moritz is already in compliance with the requirement.

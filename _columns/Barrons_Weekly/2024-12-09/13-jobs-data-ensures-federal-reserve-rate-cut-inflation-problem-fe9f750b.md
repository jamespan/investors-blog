  November payrolls were slightly ahead of expectations, with a slight decline in the participation rate for over-65ers. But monetary policy as a new administration begins is an array of unknowns.

The Fed might cut rates before tariffs boost inflation.






The latest employment data likely cemented another interest-rate reduction by the Federal Reserve later this month but did little to clarify the monetary-policy outlook for 2025. 


The Fed will confront an array of unknowns, including a still-resilient U.S. economy but a cooling labor market, stubbornly sticky inflation, and, perhaps, irrationally exuberant financial conditions. That doesn’t include the unknowns of the timing and magnitude of tariffs to be imposed by the incoming Trump administration, plus any other uncertainties awaiting us in the new year.


 As expected, business payrolls rebounded sharply last month from October’s weather- and strike-depressed tally. The unemployment rate, derived from a separate survey of households, ticked up slightly, however, which reflected mainly technical factors such as rounding of the number and demographics of an aging population.


Looking to the score card, nonfarm payrolls rose by a 227,000 in November, trivially higher than the consensus guess of 220,000, with an upward revision totaling 56,000 in the two preceding months. Last month’s showing was a marked bounceback from October’s revised 36,000 rise, which was depressed by hurricanes and the effects of the strike against [Boeing](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/BA) . 


The headline jobless rate edged up to 4.2% in November from 4.1%, which largely reflected the conventions of rounding to a single decimal place. Last month’s unemployment rate was 4.246%, up from 4.145% in October, so a few thousandths of a percentage point could have moved the headline number either way. (Isn’t it time to get away from rounding to one decimal, a practice more suited to the days we used slide rules instead of artificial intelligence? That’s from someone old and nerdy enough to have used a slide rule back at the Bronx High School of Science.)


On the subject of age, that was a factor in one seemingly worrisome aspect of the unemployment data. The labor-force participation rate edged down to 62.5% last month, from 62.6% in October, which Jefferies chief economist Thomas Simons points out was the result of a large number of folks moving up to the 65-plus category. 


Among that rapidly expanding cohort, the labor-force participation rate dropped to 19.3% from 20%. (The increase in their nest eggs from the stock market likely encouraged many of them to retire.) Among prime-age people (25-54 years), the participation rate remains a healthy 83.5%, near July’s 84%, which was the highest since July 2000.


Given the largely as-expected jobs report, the federal-funds futures market put an overwhelming 85.1% probability the Federal Open Market Committee would lower its key policy rate by 25 basis points from the current target range of 4.5% to 4.75% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Dec. 18, [according to the CME FedWatch site](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) . (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.)


That pretty much assumes that the next key data release, November’s consumer price index, doesn’t surprise to the upside. Economists’ consensus estimates call for a 0.2% overall rise for the latest month, with a 0.3% increase in “core” consumer prices excluding food and energy, matching the October numbers. 


To Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, the employment data show incomes growing at healthy, 5% annual clip, the result of payroll growth, hours worked, and average hourly earnings. The last metric shows 4% annual pay growth, which may be worrisome to Fed policymakers looking to bring inflation down to their 2% target.


But Weinberg thinks the Fed will want to bring its fed-funds target down in 2025 before tariffs boost the inflation gauges. In an interview, he distinguishes the impact of one-time price hikes from tariffs from ongoing inflation. Even so, optics would make it difficult for the Fed to cut rates if the CPI were ticking higher, so the central bank would want to get ahead of that.





Similarly, [Nomura](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/NMR) economists are forecasting only two 25-basis-point rate cuts before the Fed pauses in 2025. By comparison, [Bank of America](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/BAC) economists expect three such cuts next year, which is in line with the fed-funds futures market’s pricing, shown in the chart here. [J.P. Morgan](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/JPM) 



 economists look for four cuts totaling a full percentage point, which would be in line with the median from the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, released at the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
While that was the median projection, Weinberg points out there is a wide dispersion of views among FOMC members. He sees the Fed wanting to prevent the real (inflation-adjusted) policy rate from passively rising as the inflation rate eases.


Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated this past week that the central bank is in no rush to lower rates while the economy is performing well. Other Fed officials have been more forthright in pushing back against the need for significant rate cuts.


Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman opined this past week that it’s “hard to think that interest rates are restrictive now,” a view consistent with stock market indexes at records, corporate bond yield spreads at historic lows, and Bitcoin topping \$100,000 this past week. In her first policy speech since being named to the post, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said Friday, “I believe we are at or near the point where it makes sense to slow the pace of rate reductions.”


A clash between Powell and Donald Trump could be in the offing next year, writes Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist for

.

 While Trump probably can’t fire Powell, the president-elect could try to oust the central bank chief if the latter moves slowly on rate cuts, Valliere wrote in a client note on Thursday.
The Fed policy path is clear for this month’s meeting following the job report. For the year ahead, however, it is strewn with myriad uncertainties.

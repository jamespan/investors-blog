Sentinel Security Life, Haymarket, and Jazz Reinsurance—Advantage Capital insurers that fall under Utah’s jurisdiction—have negative asset balances, making them unable to meet their liabilities to policyholders, according to an emergency order posted Monday on the Utah Insurance Commissioner’s website. The insurance firms were directed to stop writing new business by Dec. 31.

An examination commissioned by the Utah agency found that the carriers had a collective deficit totaling more than \$520 million, according to the order.

Examiners also found that companies affiliated with A-CAP, as Advantage Capital is commonly known, “engaged in high-risk investments” and that the insurers’ exposure to some entities overstepped state rules on investment concentration.

The conclusions track the findings of a [*Barron’s* investigation this summer](https://www.barrons.com/articles/annuities-risks-retirement-sentinel-atlantic-coast-a-cap-ec9dbba5?mod=article_inline) , which showed that A-CAP’s insurers had invested heavily in businesses that fall under the parent company’s control, raising potential conflicts of interest.

If the insurers “continue to write business, a consumer who buys a policy may not obtain the financial protection that the policy would otherwise provide,” Commissioner Jonathan T. Pike wrote in his agency’s order. “This threat is an immediate danger to the public welfare.”

An A-CAP spokesman had no immediate comment on the action.

In June, A-CAP had told *Barron’s* that all of its “investments go through a rigorous investment and compliance review and are reported in accordance with any relevant investment statute.”

Pike noted in the order that the A-CAP insurers had criticized the examiners’ work.

The Utah Insurance Commissioner has jurisdiction over Sentinel, Haymarket, and Jazz because they are domiciled in that state. Since U.S. insurers are regulated at the state level, the ban on writing new policies applies nationwide.

A-CAP’s three Utah-domiciled firms account for about 70% of the \$11.5 billion in assets claimed by insurers in the group as of the end of 2023, according to data maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

Two other carriers, Atlantic Coast and Southern Atlantic, are domiciled in South Carolina, and are regulated by that state’s insurance commissioner. That agency didn’t respond to a message from *Barron’s* asking about any action it may take following the Utah order.

A-CAP has been a beneficiary of the recent explosion in the popularity of annuities, which offer CD-like savings horizons, plus tax advantages for people in or nearing retirement and better interest than most highly regulated banks can offer. Last year, A-CAP’s insurers sold \$1.7 billion in annuities contracts.

Insurance companies such as those under A-CAP invest the proceeds from their policy sales to service future payouts. Utah’s commissioner found that the A-CAP insurers’ investment portfolios it examined “included a disproportionately large number of high-risk investments.”

One set of A-CAP investments highlighted by *Barron’s* investigation in June involved loans to an entity called PAC Wagon, which had recently been formed by an A-CAP executive.

The A-CAP insurers said in their 2023 annual reports that those loans were collectively worth nearly \$290 million, making it one of the largest holdings disclosed by any U.S. insurance firm that year.

The examiners hired by Utah’s commissioner estimated the insurance companies would recover between 24 cents and 27 cents for every dollar lent to PAC Wagon.

“The companies are using funds from new premiums and/or liquidating investments other than the impaired investments to pay their obligations as they become due,” Pike wrote.

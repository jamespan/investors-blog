I nvestors are laser-focused on U.S. stocks, creating a dangerous blind spot. Ignoring the rest of the world comes with rising risks into the new year—and missed opportunities to more cheaply invest in the types of companies that have fueled the U.S. bull market.

Investors are laser-focused on U.S. stocks, creating a dangerous blind spot. Ignoring the rest of the world comes with rising risks into the new year—and missed opportunities to more cheaply invest in the types of companies that have fueled the U.S. bull market.Investing abroad has been a hard sell. China’s economy is sputtering, and Beijing’s efforts to revive it are underwhelming. China is leaning on exports for growth, triggering a wave of protectionism and reshuffling of trade flows as countries try to protect domestic industries. And international markets have been in a deep funk: The [S&P 500 index](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) returned an average annual 13% over the past decade, more than double that of the MSCI EAFE index and trouncing the 2.6% delivered by the MSCI Emerging Markets index.

But the shifting geopolitical and economic forces abroad—including the [fraying U.S.-China relationship,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-u-s-congress-tariffs-ai-iran-542d9f34?mod=article_inline) changes in China’s economy sparking new tariff threats, and the fallout from the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East—create challenges for global giants. The good news is that the challenges come with a new set of winners.

*Barron’s* convened four global market watchers on Nov. 21 for a virtual journey around the world and found a relatively upbeat outlook for globe-trotting stockpickers. They looked through the [cloud of uncertainty](https://www.barrons.com/articles/us-election-president-trump-harris-trade-wars-662af597?mod=article_inline) from President-elect Donald Trump’s proposals to slap 60% tariffs on Chinese imports and as much as 20% on others, as well as questions about the trajectory of China’s economy. The result: a dozen stocks and notable shifts that will affect all types of portfolios.

Our international experts include Tom Slater, partner, global public and private-equity manager, and manager of [Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust](/market-data/funds/smt?countrycode=uk&mod=article_chiclet) at Baillie Gifford; Christine Phillpotts, manager of the Ariel Emerging Markets Value and Ariel Emerging Markets Value ex-China strategies; Rory Green, chief China economist and head of Asia research, GlobalData TS Lombard, and Alberto Fassinotti, a managing director at RockCreek Group, responsible for emerging markets.

An edited version of the discussion follows.

***Barron’s*:** Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Given the performance over the past decade, why should investors care about foreign stocks?

**Christine Phillpotts:** Within emerging markets, stocks have been cheap for some time. As value investors, that’s intriguing, but you also need to see signs of a catalyst for improvement.

And we are beginning to see a couple: countries with strong balance sheets for the first time in decades with the capacity to leverage fiscal policy to drive domestic growth. Companies are also accelerating their growth with domestic opportunities, including market share gains as well as returning more capital to shareholders and more judicious mergers-and-acquisitions activity, such that earnings-per-share growth could start to outpace gross-domestic-product growth. On top of that, stocks are still trading at single-digit multiples.

**Alberto Fassinotti:** EPS growth outpacing GDP growth is key. For a long time, it was the other way around, and GDP growth often did not translate to equity market performance, as we saw in China.

From an asset-allocation picture, we are telling clients: You’ve done extremely well with your U.S. equity [exposure]. Wall Street is forecasting that S&P 500 returns over the next 10 years will be a fraction of the past decade’s returns, so it’s in your interest to look to diversify. But there’s hesitancy to be the first to pull the cord on a change.

**Rory Green:** The U.S. dominated “tech,” particularly software, for the past decade. This, in turn, has powered U.S. equity outperformance. Going forward, China and to a lesser extent Northeast Asia, will take over as the leading players in tech hardware innovation. This transition alongside broader shifts in society, such as the move to clean energy and the Internet of Things, is a significant opportunity for emerging markets.

**What is the impact of the geopolitical shifts on investment opportunities?**

**Tom Slater:** I tie this to why sentiment on China is so dire. The market is focused on playing the wrong game and missing the big picture. Everybody’s focusing on the [prospect for stimulus](https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-fiscal-stimulus-trump-tariffs-7aef8045?mod=article_inline) in China to revive the property market and consumption, but that’s guesswork. The real play is recognizing what [China is] doing long term: growing its high-tech economy in the areas of national importance.

The Chinese are making massive progress in electric vehicles, supply chains, semiconductors, and advanced manufacturing. That long-run progress and advancement in high tech industries is the compelling reason to be looking at China. Some of the political developments in the world have been a direct response to that progress.

**Green:** Some of China’s internal structural changes are a big factor in pushing the political and tariff response in the rest of the world. That’s only going to increase. China already has a 30% share of global manufacturing and now has developed markets-level technology capability and emerging markets–level costs. And there’s enormous state support for these industries.

If you read [Chinese President] Xi Jinping’s speeches, he sounds like a tech bro: It’s all tech, tech, tech. The amount of money getting chucked into these sectors is enormous. We are seeing China move up the value chain. EVs are just the tip of the iceberg.

China is just too competitive. Its global trade share is at a record high of 17%, above when Trump was first elected.

The response [in the U.S. and elsewhere] is more tariffs—and more to come in terms of heightened national security issues. That, in turn, is going to push a restructuring of trade and manufacturing.

**What does that mean for portfolios?**

**Phillpotts:** The conversation around tariffs lumps emerging markets into the same bucket and is perceived as a net negative. But the impetus [among companies] is not deglobalization but de-concentration, providing opportunities for emerging markets to gain share.

[Samsung Electronics](/market-data/stocks/005930?countrycode=kr&mod=article_chiclet) produces about 50% of its phones now in Vietnam, which is following the manufacturing-led exports as a growth playbook that has worked for South Korea and Taiwan. Whether it’s Vietnam, Mexico, or Morocco, these [countries and some companies] are part of the solution as the U.S. and European Union look to localize their supply chains. That’s why [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing](/market-data/stocks/2330?countrycode=tw&mod=article_chiclet) was incentivized to build a plant in Arizona, Korean battery manufacturers are expanding in the U.S., and the EU is inviting Chinese companies to build local plants.

![](https://images.barrons.com/im-79641351?width=700&height=700)Christine Phillpotts, manager of the Ariel Emerging Markets Value and Ariel Emerging Markets Value ex-China strategies. (Photograph by Laurel Golio)**How could these trends affect trade policy?**

**Fassinotti:** China has a [playbook from the first Trump administration:](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-u-s-and-china-just-signed-a-trade-deal-heres-what-experts-say-happens-next-51579130072?mod=article_inline) It will further solidify its global supply chain with partners outside the U.S. and the EU. Chinese markets did well during the first Trump administration, and Brazil had boom times with commodity exports to China. The folks who suffered were U.S. farmers.

[These trends] will be more pronounced based on the difference in tariffs rates for China versus the rest of the world, whether China can successfully circumvent those tariffs, as well as what [happens with Mexico](https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tariffs-who-gets-hurt-mexico-china-d1da2d50?mod=article_inline) . Trump was a big champion of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Now, he’s making noises that would effectively undermine aspects of that deal. We view it as bluster to hopefully come to an agreement in the middle. The global economy still depends on that Chinese value proposition. It’s in everybody’s interest to find a deal.

**Phillpotts:** We always focus on what governments are looking to achieve and how we can align with that.

In terms of the tariffs, we own Chinese auto maker [Great Wall Motor](/market-data/stocks/2333?countrycode=hk&mod=article_chiclet) . The immediate concern is if the 40% of its volume that’s international—mostly to the Global South, or other emerging markets, is going to be slashed because of this tariff talk. But they are exporting to countries with minimal to no tariffs on autos because those countries don’t have a domestic auto industry to defend—and with extremely high margins. The U.S. and the EU are extremely large markets, but you can still export to the rest of the world and do quite well.

And the Global South increasingly has an impetus to consider remapping trade and geopolitical relationships. There are more bilateral and multilateral conversations, excluding the U.S. and the EU. Thinking about the winners and losers of that remapping is going to be very important.

**Green:** As China gets so competitive on price in these advanced manufactured products, like EVs, the price becomes low enough that you unlock a new type of consumption a la the Model T Ford as the first car that factory workers could purchase. This [translates] to low-cost mobile phones, low-cost airlines, and so on.

In terms of the restructuring of trade and investment relationships, the first phase was the Belt and Road Initiative with China exporting excess infrastructure and construction capacity. The current phase is more around manufacturing, partly to get around tariffs. For Chinese companies, growth at home is slowing and competition is intense, so if you can look overseas for growth, that’s great—and the government is supportive of that. The growth rate is much higher in less developed economies than in developed markets—and that will accelerate under a second Trump administration.

**Slater:** China has swung from a net importer of finished vehicles to exporter. Sticking with EVs: The market in China is just moving much more quickly than anywhere else, with about 50% of new-car sales now EVs. The level of competition and sophistication is far ahead—and price points far below.

That shows up in the dramatic decline in market share [for foreign auto makers] like [Volkswagen](/market-data/stocks/vow3?countrycode=xe&mod=article_chiclet) , which said profits fell 42% last quarter. And Chinese [auto makers] are taking growing share of their domestic markets and in the Global South.

![](https://images.barrons.com/im-50465216?width=940&height=626)(Illustration by Álvaro Bernis)**Does this extend into other industries?**

**Slater:** In technology, the world has been carved up into the U.S. and Chinese spheres of influence. That leaves the question of which sphere of influence other countries fall into: Will [Amazon.com](/market-data/stocks/amzn?mod=article_chiclet) be successful in India or will it be [Alibaba Group Holding](/market-data/stocks/baba?mod=article_chiclet) ?

Tech leadership and the influence of Big Tech goes to why China is important. Very few countries have been successful in developing their technology ecosystem and growing companies. China is the one place other than the U.S. where you have seen successful private entrepreneurs operate at real scale.

**Beijing cracked down on Big Tech a couple of years ago, halving the value of internet giants like Alibaba and rattling investors. Is that over?**

**Slater:** It’s the action of the government and regulators in China that have made things difficult. But [the big companies] are an important part of the Chinese strategy.

A growing number of data points suggests we are through the worst of that regulatory challenge. The big signal to look for is whether the Ant Group’s international initial public offering comes back. [Beijing canceled the IPO of the fintech founded by [Alibaba](/market-data/stocks/9988?countrycode=hk&mod=article_chiclet) ’s Jack Ma, scuttling what was expected to be the world’s largest IPO in 2020].

**Fassinotti:** China will not get back to even a modicum of its previous [growth rates](https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-stimulus-stocks-risks-volatility-ec28f8c4?mod=article_inline) if it doesn’t figure out the domestic economy and consumer. Part of reason you’ve seen tech companies meet Xi in the middle is because there’s a mutual recognition that it’s in everybody’s interest that tech platforms continue to thrive.

We own [Atour Lifestyle Holdings](/market-data/stocks/atat?mod=article_chiclet) , an affordable-hotel chain that grew revenue 47%, and opened 140 new hotels in the latest quarter. They turn hotel rooms into immersive showrooms, using proprietary technology to personalize products and services.

These types of technology-enabled businesses are going to be the linchpin to a recovery because China will not be able to export its way out of its problems.

![](https://images.barrons.com/im-16756428?width=700&height=700)Alberto Fassinotti, managing director at RockCreek Group, responsible for emerging markets. (Photograph by Lexey Swall)**Let’s go back to the** [**challenges**](https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-economy-debt-slowdown-recession-65f51b85?mod=article_inline)  **facing China’s economy. How bad is the situation?**

**Green:** Structurally we’re talking about debt, decoupling, and demographics. Since 2021, it’s the debt/ [property](https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-property-market-cant-heal-who-feels-pain-97522a46?mod=article_inline) nexus that has been the primary drag on growth. At its peak, Chinese property was around 28% of GDP, the major source of household wealth, the key driver of local government revenue, and the largest exposure on bank balance sheets. When Xi Jinping began to more aggressively crack down on the property sector, triggering the current contraction, that has had massive spillovers throughout the entire economy.

Layer on Covid lockdowns and the economy is in a balance sheet recession, with an unwillingness for people to borrow, spend, or invest. We are about five years into Xi’s longer-term aim of restructuring the economy [toward domestic demand]. This is a managed economic transition—very painful but not a collapse. We expect GDP growth next year of 4.5%.

**Investors have been skittish about China. What’s changing on that front?** 

**Phillpotts:** We started [adding more China exposure] in April, driven by evidence that things were not as bad as feared, looking at leading indicators of real estate demand—visitations, conversion rates, spreads between bid and ask prices. While still negative, the pace of declines was decelerating. Although demand has plummeted, so have new starts, down 65% from the 2021 peak. Inventories have already begun to decline.

Markets are discounting this notion there’s going to be a collapse, creating a systemic risk to China Inc. We don’t think that’s the case, largely because China is a closed capital account. Comparing it to other real estate crises is like apples to oranges. Several differences will help [Beijing] manage the pace of decline that’s not captured in the market. For example, loan-to-value ratios, on average, are hovering around 50%, compared with 100% or more in other markets that had crises.

On the company front, we’re seeing an improvement in management behavior and better capital allocation. Leading companies are also increasing market share as [rivals flail] in this weaker macroeconomic environment. We’re seeing a lot of idiosyncratic catalysts driving us to be more bullish.

**Slater:** The risk of investing in China has changed. There’s the geopolitical and trade risks and risks from Chinese regulatory or government actions. If I’m going to take the risk, then I want to get the opportunity to make several times my money. That doesn’t take us toward consumer staples because to make my money back I’m relying on steady growth over a long time frame—and I don’t know what’s going to happen over that [horizon]. Instead, I’m looking at companies that can grow explosively.

And being a tall poppy or a very large Chinese company—the Alibabas and Tencents—has been difficult. Both are larger than 10 years ago and under more regulatory scrutiny. It’s harder to see how you make those big payoffs.

**What do you want to own?**

**Slater:** We own [PDD Holdings](/market-data/stocks/pdd?mod=article_chiclet) . The e-commerce platform recently reported 80% revenue growth, and management has shown itself to be an effective operator targeting a very large opportunity. They connect factories and farms that have inventory to consumers in a flash sale format of time-limited offers at very low cost. They usurped [rival] Taobao to become the lowest-cost platform for everyday items, a remarkable achievement. They have a big profitable business and will be an important component of getting the domestic economy going. They also have grown their export business, Temu, in a number of international markets.

**Temu is under scrutiny in the U.S. because of how it ships packages through a trade loophole. What risk does that pose?**

**Slater:** That could be a risk, but what about their business in the Global South, Southeast Asian, or European markets? Plus, all the profits are made in China.

**Fassinotti:** For U.S. institutional investors, anti-China sentiment is still there, with some investors removing China from their benchmarks. They aren’t outright restricting investment in China, but it puts the onus on the investor to make sure the types of businesses they’re investing in China outperform handsomely. The bar has been set very high, and liquidity is lower.

![](https://images.barrons.com/im-52751812?width=700&height=700)Rory Green, chief China economist & head of Asia research, GlobalData TS Lombard. (Photograph by Jillian Edelstein)**What passes that high hurdle?**

**Fassinotti:** [China Yangtze Power](/market-data/stocks/600900?countrycode=cn&mod=article_chiclet) , a hydropower utility, is well run with low debt and generates consistent return on investment capital. You still have to keep the lights on and supply power to the manufacturing base. It’s names like these that [governments or investors] are not going to kick up a fuss like they may for companies that have applications for defense or that are part of culture wars like ByteDance and TikTok.

**Slater:** [Meituan](/market-data/stocks/3690?countrycode=hk&mod=article_chiclet) , a local services company providing food and other products, is growing [revenue] about 20% in domestic China, and they have shown they can operate at a massive scale, providing a very economically attractive proposition to consumers. With what they have learned, you see them increasingly looking to deploy that skill set outside of China. [BYD](/market-data/stocks/002594?countrycode=cn&mod=article_chiclet) is growing [revenue] 40% but still making over 20% returns on capital. It has a competitive product that manufacturers in other countries can’t compete with, which means a huge addressable market before we even touch on the topic of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous driving is going to develop much more rapidly in China than elsewhere, which is why you see [Tesla](/market-data/stocks/tsla?mod=article_chiclet) in China.

**What does Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with Trump mean for U.S.-China relations and Tesla itself?**

**Slater:** Tesla has done well developing products people love, manufacturing them at scale and continually improving, moving faster than everybody else. Lots of Western companies have been nervous about going into China and [worrying] they would have their intellectual property stolen. Tesla [which we own] took a different approach and decided that this is going to be a [competitive market](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-byd-china-price-war-ev-4086386a?mod=article_inline) ; it’s the world’s largest auto market and we have to go there and win by having better prices and better products. That applies with the next generation of products like robo-taxis, cybercars, or these autonomous platforms. It sets Tesla up better to compete in the rest of the world. It’s a commercial strategy rather than politics.

**Phillpotts:** It just illustrates to me that policy is going to be much more transactional-based. There’s going to be winners and losers from that, and it’s going to lead to a wider dispersion of returns and a wider dispersion of outcomes for specific companies and sectors.

**In the past, investors tapped Chinese opportunities through global multinationals.**

**Slater:** The perception of Chinese consumers has changed. There’s more of an affinity for domestic brands as we see an increase in quality that wasn’t there five years ago.

One exception is luxury because brand heritage distinguishes these products. Take [Hermès International](/market-data/stocks/rms?countrycode=fr&mod=article_chiclet) . Over the past 20 years to the end of 2023, Hermès grew earnings 21-fold and revenue 11-fold, with a significant part of that growth from Asian consumers. China luxury spend per capita is only a fifth of that in the U.S., so for Hermès, China will be the next China.

**Phillpotts:** That may be the case for Hermès and its positioning, but we have seen multinationals use that same rationale to predict their continued success in China and fail. The clearest example is in autos, whether [Porsche](/market-data/stocks/p911?countrycode=xe&mod=article_chiclet) , [Mercedes-Benz](/market-data/stocks/mbg?countrycode=xe&mod=article_chiclet) , or [BMW](/market-data/stocks/bmw?countrycode=xe&mod=article_chiclet) that for a long time were relying on that premium-brand perception as domestic players were ramping up. Extremely quickly, they have seen their share tremendously eroded. We have seen domestic brands with value for money, design, and innovation nip at the heels at the perception the foreign premium brand is unassailable.

**Green:** Smartphones are another great example of that. [Samsung](/market-data/stocks/005930?countrycode=kr&mod=article_chiclet) was 20% of the China market. It’s less than 1% now. You have to be really careful, particularly in the manufacturing or consumer durable side.

**Let’s shift to the hot conflicts dominating the headlines. What is the market impact if a**  [**deal**](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/election-results-trump-harris-2024/card/how-trump-s-win-upends-u-s-relations-with-ukraine-china-and-israel-4HltZQZRWMoa1RjxOiAL?mod=article_inline)  **emerges between Russia and Ukraine?**

**Fassinotti:** It boils down to details. There will probably be some territorial concessions, but in return Russians will most likely want the removal of sanctions. You would probably see some sort of reintegration of Russia with Europe, but it’s a big ask [to lift sanctions.]

In the short term, a deal probably would be good for risk sentiment and for markets, commodities especially. It may not be as good for India, which was Russia’s No. 1 customer [for discounted oil and iron ore] over the past couple of years.

**Phillpotts:** We own [OTP Bank](/market-data/stocks/otp?countrycode=hu&mod=article_chiclet) , one of the largest Central and Eastern European commercial and retail banks, which would benefit from reconstruction activity, in particular within Ukraine

**Fassinotti:** It’s not just about what will happen with Russia and Europe and the U.S., but the derivative consequences, which will be more consequential to the global economy and to markets.

If the Chinese see a deal can be had after sanctions, they might think about pulling the trigger on Taiwan.

**Green** : We see the [Taiwan invasion risk](https://www.barrons.com/articles/china-isnt-going-to-put-the-squeeze-on-taiwans-new-leader-for-now-he-doesnt-have-a-mandate-a00544d4?mod=article_inline) as very low on a 10-year horizon. Beijing believes the East is rising and the West is declining, and if it waits 20 years, China will be an even more dominant player, so there’s no reason to rush. Any invasion—according to People’s Liberation Army documents—would be exceptionally difficult militarily and economically and involve a huge risk for the Chinese Communist Party.

**What does it all mean for Europe?**

**Slater:** It would be good if war in Europe went away. But the challenge in Europe has been founding, scaling, and having deep enough capital markets to support big, new businesses. You have eight \$1 trillion or more market-value companies in the U.S. and none in Europe. It’s that failure to build the right environment for that type of success that really has been the biggest challenge. We find it a difficult place to generate new ideas.

**Where are you finding new ideas?**

**Green:** Within Chinese equities, our top pick is infrastructure. China has signaled a stance that it will do whatever it takes—eventually—to stabilize growth. Leading indicators for infrastructure spending are some of the strongest we’ve seen. We think infrastructure is going to play a bigger role next year and related equities will benefit.

Longer term, we talked a lot about technology, with EVs the tip of the iceberg. Two areas where China competition will go global: robotics and aviation, so sector ETFs are a play over a three- to four- year horizon.

**Phillpotts:** [Mobile World Investment](/market-data/stocks/mwg?countrycode=vn&mod=article_chiclet) is a \$3.5 billion Vietnamese retailer that we think will generate strong double-digit EPS growth. They have two parts of their business: electronics and food retail, which they are looking to sell a stake in. Only 20% of food retail in Vietnam is formalized, and they are growing tremendously.

Another is [Emaar Properties](/market-data/stocks/emaar?countrycode=ae&mod=article_chiclet) , a real estate company in the United Arab Emirates benefiting from the growth of Dubai. A lot of people thought growth was from Russians moving to Dubai because of the war. But it’s more structural. We are seeing population growth driven not just by expats but also increasingly families, which leaves more scope for consumption to increase. Emaar is one of the leading shopping mall owners.

**Fassinotti:** We own [Promotora y Operadora de Infraestructure](/market-data/stocks/pinfra?countrycode=mx&mod=article_chiclet) in Mexico that’s doing well on the back of this reshoring and nearshoring trend as Korean, Chinese, and other multinational companies set up manufacturing bases along that border corridor to the U.S.

In India, the market has done well. We have switched from financials, which have been popular, toward more consumer companies like [Mrs. Bectors Food Specialties](/market-data/stocks/543253?countrycode=in&mod=article_chiclet) , a biscuits and breads manufacturer tied into the quick-service restaurant model. That is your classic disposable income, rising consumer story, and we think the consumer in India is in a better position this year and next.

**What is one theme in international markets not getting enough attention?**

**Slater:** There’s an emergence of a middle class across a host of emerging markets, driving consumption. These customers’ expectations are driven entirely around online offerings because there is not an established physical retail infrastructure and these platforms— [MercadoLibre](/market-data/stocks/meli?mod=article_chiclet) in Brazil, [Coupang](/market-data/stocks/cpng?mod=article_chiclet) in South Korea and Taiwan, [Sea Ltd.](/market-data/stocks/se?mod=article_chiclet) in Southeast Asia—are offering consumers access to a much wider range of products at much lower prices than previously conceivable. And all of these businesses have operated in challenging economic and geopolitical conditions successfully. It’s great management teams and big, open-ended opportunities.

**Thanks, all.**

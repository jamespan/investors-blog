Palantir moved to the Nasdaq from the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 26, citing its potential for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100. The company was valued at \$152 billion on Nov. 29. While exchange-traded funds and index products based on the Nasdaq 100 are nowhere near as large as those based on the [S&P 500](/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) , they are significant. Companies added to the Nasdaq 100 can rally as indexers and exchange-traded funds managers buy the stocks.

Unlike the S&P 500, which makes changes based on criteria like market value, profitability, and industry group, the Nasdaq 100 tends to be based on market value. Nasdaq 100 companies with the lowest market values are vulnerable to deletion. These companies range from \$16.6 billion to \$23.8 billion in market value, less than 0.1% of the index’s value. Last December, the Nasdaq 100 added seven companies and dropped seven.

Changes can also occur at other times. [AppLovin](/market-data/stocks/app?mod=article_chiclet) , the largest Nasdaq stock not in the index, replaced [Dollar Tree](/market-data/stocks/dltr?mod=article_chiclet) in November.

#### Last Week

### Markets

South Korea underwent six hours of martial law before the National Assembly overturned it and began steps to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol. The French government led by Michael Barnier fell in a no-confidence vote. [Bitcoin](/market-data/cryptocurrencies/btcusd?iso=kraken&mod=article_chiclet) topped \$100,000 as President-elect Trump tapped pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission. Jobs snapped back to 227,000 in November. On the week, the [Dow industrials](/market-data/indexes/djia?mod=article_chiclet) fell 0.6%, the S&P 500 rose 1%, and the [Nasdaq Composite](/market-data/indexes/comp?mod=article_chiclet) was up 3.3%.

### Companies

The U.S. slapped new export controls on chips to China, which then banned exports of rare metals to the U.S. Volkswagen workers walked out in Germany. Carlos Tavares, CEO of struggling [Stellantis](/market-data/stocks/stla?mod=article_chiclet) , quit. Intel said CEO Pat Gelsinger is retiring after four years and will leave the board. A Delaware judge rejected [Tesla](/market-data/stocks/tsla?mod=article_chiclet) ’s attempt to restore Elon Musk’s \$56 billion pay, despite a new shareholder vote. An appeals court upheld a U.S. TikTok ban. Brian Thompson, CEO of [UnitedHealth](/market-data/stocks/unh?mod=article_chiclet) ’s insurance arm, was shot in Manhattan in what police called a “targeted killing.” The suspect remained at large.

### Deals

Trump reiterated his opposition to [Nippon Steel](/market-data/stocks/5401?countrycode=jp&mod=article_chiclet) buying [United States Steel](/market-data/stocks/x?mod=article_chiclet) … [BlackRock](/market-data/stocks/blk?mod=article_chiclet) agreed to buy private-credit manager [HPS](/market-data/stocks/hps.a?countrycode=ca&mod=article_chiclet) for some \$12 billion, all in stock.

### [Milestone](/market-data/stocks/mist?mod=article_chiclet)

Art Cashin, [UBS](/market-data/stocks/ubs?mod=article_chiclet) ’ director of NYSE floor operations and a longtime CNBC market commentator and raconteur, died at 83.

#### Next Week

### Monday 12/9

**A quartet of megacap** companies report results on a light week for the earnings calendar. [Oracle](/market-data/stocks/orcl?mod=article_chiclet) announces quarterly results after the closing bell on Monday, and [Adobe](/market-data/stocks/adbe?mod=article_chiclet) does the same on Wednesday. [Broadcom](/market-data/stocks/avgo?mod=article_chiclet) and [Costco Wholesale](/market-data/stocks/cost?mod=article_chiclet) release earnings on Thursday.

### Wednesday 12/11

**The Bureau of Labor** Statistics releases the consumer price index for November. Economists forecast a 2.7% year-over-year increase for the CPI, one-tenth of a percentage point more than in October. The core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 3.3%, which would match the October figure. The annual change in the CPI has been less than 3% for four consecutive months, but getting to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target has proved to be a sticky proposition.

### Thursday 12/12

**The European Central** Bank announces its monetary-policy decision. The ECB is widely expected to cut its key short-term interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3%.

With the recent collapse of the French government due to a no-confidence vote, economists forecast up to five quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, to prop up what was an already struggling euro-zone economy.

#### The Numbers

### 3.7 M

Births in the 27 states of the European Union in 2023, the largest annual decline at 5.5% on record.

### 51%

Share of workers in November who said they are watching for or seeking a new job, highest since 2015.

### 38.4%

China’s 2023 market share in global car production, up from 1.4% in 1998. Former No. 1 Japan is at 11.4%.

### 544 K

Number of millionaire 401(k)s at Fidelity in the third quarter, a record. Average balances hit a high, too.

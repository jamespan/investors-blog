(Al Drago/Bloomberg)Several members of Congress have asked the Department of Justice to investigate pharmacy-benefit managers’ business related to opioids, [citing a *Barron’s* investigation](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pbm-drug-prices-insulin-opioid-crisis-dcf9e83c?mod=article_inline) on rebate payments that the companies received on sales of OxyContin.

“The lack of transparency surrounding PBM’s rebate agreements and formulary decisions has allowed them to operate with little to no oversight, posing a significant threat to America’s public-health,” four representatives said in a [letter](https://buddycarter.house.gov/uploadedfiles/lettertodoj_pbm.pdf) to Attorney General Merrick Garland. “That is why we strongly urge the Department of Justice to investigate the role PBMs may have played in the opioid crisis and hold them accountable.”

The bipartisan letter was signed by Republican Reps. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter, of Georgia, and Cliff Bentz, of Oregon, and Democratic Reps. Deborah Ross, of North Carolina, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, of Illinois.

“I’ve seen the effects of the opioid crisis, from parents who have told me about kids taking opioids without knowing, to people in rural areas who have been exploited,” Ross told *Barron’s* . “It’s just so, so important to try every angle.”

*Barron’s* reported in October on internal drug company documents detailing rebate payments that are usually kept secret. During a one-year period between 2016 and 2017, *Barron’s* found, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma paid about \$400 million in rebates and fees to three major pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBMs— [CVS Health](/market-data/stocks/cvs?mod=article_chiclet) ’s Caremark, [UnitedHealth](/market-data/stocks/unh?mod=article_chiclet) ’s Optum Rx, and [Cigna](/market-data/stocks/ci?mod=article_chiclet) ’s Express Scripts.

“It deserves to be looked at,” Carter, a pharmacist, told *Barron’s* . “I was practicing pharmacy during that time, when this was a problem. I saw it first hand, so that’s why it means so much to me and that’s why I think they should be held accountable.”

Health plans have the ability to set quantity limits on the amount of medication the plan will cover. One set of contracts between Purdue and Caremark, from 2014 to 2017, indicated that rebates increased if plans authorized higher amounts of OxyContin.

All three PBMs were named in the congressional letter, which is dated Nov. 26.

Given that President-elect Donald Trump “has shown concern about this area,” Ross said, “I think it’s one of those areas where the Justice Department can do good work from administration to administration.”

During Trump’s first term in office, he declared the opioid epidemic to be a public-health emergency.

Drug companies commonly pay rebates to PBMs for their products to be covered by insurance plans. PBMs say rebates generate savings for health plans and serve as a check on the pharmaceutical industry’s pricing power. Critics argue the rebate system puts upward pressure on drug prices and distorts incentives for selecting which drugs are offered by insurers.

In a statement to *Barron’s* , a CVS Health spokesperson pointed to efforts the company had made to combat opioid addiction and said: “CVS Caremark exists to make the use of prescription drugs not only more affordable, but safer.”

Last year CVS Health finalized a \$5 billion global opioid settlement that resolved claims related to its pharmacy business and its PBM. The company didn’t admit liability.

Optum Rx and Express Scripts didn’t respond to requests for comment on the letter. The two companies have denied wrongdoing in current litigation over the opioid epidemic. Express Scripts previously told *Barron’s* that it “is a leader in the fight against prescription opioid abuse and misuse, and any assertion otherwise is false.”

The three largest PBMs are integrated in large healthcare firms that also have insurance arms. Collectively those PBMs handle about 80% of U.S. prescription claims.

Concerns about the secrecy surrounding the PBM industry, coupled with rising drug prices, have generated intense scrutiny in Washington. In September, the Federal Trade Commission filed suit accusing the major PBMs of inflating the price of insulin. The companies are defending against the regulator’s legal action.

Ongoing complaints by independent pharmacists about low reimbursement from PBMs have also caught the attention of Congress. A flurry of bills on Capitol Hill have proposed changes to PBM compensation practices and reporting requirements.

Carter is a leading proponent of measures to reform the PBM industry. One such bill would prohibit PBM compensation from being tied to the price of a drug in the Medicare program.

Consumers “are not reaping the benefits of lower drug costs,” says Ross, who has worked across the aisle with Carter on PBM legislation. She noted that bills on the industry have passed out of Republican- and Democratic-led committees.

“Because it’s been such bipartisan work, it might be one of those rare areas where we achieve some success,” Ross said.

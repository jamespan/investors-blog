 [Verizon Communication](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/VZ) has had a subpar 2024 but it’s not time to hang up on the wireless giant just yet. Next year looks more promising.


While Verizon stock is up a respectable 13% this year, it has lagged behind the broader market—and its two top telecom rivals. The 
[S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/indexes/spx?mod=article_chiclet) has gained 28% this year, [AT&T](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/T) has surged 40%, and [T-Mobile](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/TMUS) has soared more than 50%.


 Verizon, though, is still expected to grow its revenue and earnings in 2025 at a slightly faster clip than AT&T, which wowed Wall Street by offering upbeat guidance at its annual investor day presentation on Dec. 3. AT&T’s stock rose to its highest level in more than three years on the news. But analysts are forecasting a 2% bump in sales and 3% increase in earnings for Verizon next year, compared to 1% gains in profits and revenue for AT&T. Despite this, Verizon trades at nine times 2025 earnings estimates, a small discount to AT&T’s valuation of nearly 11 times next year’s profit projections. T-Mobile, which is growing more rapidly after its 2020 merger with Sprint, has a price/earnings multiple of 23.


But Verizon isn’t just set to benefit from a cheaper valuation. The best news for Verizon investors—if not necessarily customers—is that the company no longer needs to offer aggressively discounted plans to entice people to sign up. Morningstar analyst Michael Hodel said that “pricing discipline will drive most of Verizon’s growth,” adding that he doesn’t believe “any of the wireless carriers has an incentive to price irrationally in search of short-term market share gains.” Hodel calls Verizon “the most attractive of the three major U.S. wireless carriers,” with a fair-value estimate for the stock of \$53, nearly 25% above current levels.





Verizon is also working on a deal that could give it a longer-term boost, a planned \$20 billion acquisition of [Frontier Communications](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/FYBR) , which operates a leading fiber optic network. Frontier shareholders approved the deal in November and it is set to close, pending regulatory approval, in early 2026. The acquisition should bolster Verizon’s so-called convergence strategy, offering customers a mix of wireless and fiber phone, internet, and TV services.


That could help Verizon compete more effectively not just against AT&T but also cable rival [Comcast](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/CMCSA) . TD Cowen analyst Gregory Williams said in a report in late October that once the Frontier deal is done, both revenue and free-cash-flow growth should accelerate, adding that the “convergence play will help Verizon maintain its consumer momentum.” The bet is that customers who sign up for both FiOS TV and internet services, as well as a wireless phone, are less likely to cancel either service in favor of a rival’s offerings. In other words, the benefit of offering a bundle is, as Williams noted, “compelling…and underappreciated.”


Nobody is confusing Verizon with [Nvidia](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/NVDA) or any of the other high-flying tech stocks. But the company offers investors a gigantic dividend in addition to steady, if not spectacular, earnings growth. Verizon’s dividend yields nearly 6.4%, compared to 4.7% for AT&T, and just 4.2% for a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, making it a safe bet for investors who still crave a solid total return.


Can you hear me now?

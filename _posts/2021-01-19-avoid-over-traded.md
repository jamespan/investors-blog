Futubull users can see their daily profit/loss on the main page of their trading app. I looked at it over and over again last year, feeling good
when I have some profit intraday and feeling bad otherwise.

That's emotional, it can eventually ruin my portfolio. I was shaked out everytime When there is a little market correction.

I am not a day trader, I should care about trend, I should not looking at engine cover when I'm driving, I should look further, I should follow rules.

It's not too late that I suddenly understand what happen to me last year, I was fool by futubull, they enlarge my emotion weak point and induce me to trade more, so they can get more fee from my pocket.

Never again, good by futubull, I am using thinkorswim now.
